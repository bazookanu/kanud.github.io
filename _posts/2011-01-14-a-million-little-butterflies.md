title: A Million Little Butterflies
---
<em >He was running late for class. Despite there being no hot water in the shower, he decided to have a quick one as there was no time. The shower wasn't working. None of the showers were working in the bathroom. He ran back to his room to get his bucket. He needn't have, as there was no hot water coming out of the geyser. He cursed his luck...he had already wasted 5 minutes. He could go to another bathroom in the hostel, but he decided not to and went straight to breakfast. The food was terrible, worsening his mood with each bite. When he went to wash his hands, the tap he went to was broken. So he had to wait for some time to get to the 5?working taps out of the 8 present. The wait was hardly long, but it made him impatient all the same. There were no glasses near the drinking water dispenser. He decided to be thirsty instead of?asking the mess?workers for some glasses. Halfway to his class it started raining and he got wet. There was a sheltered path to his class. He was not on it because he took the wrong door out of the mess.</em>

That was?something?that could easily happen to someone in my institute.?It is one?of India's best?institutes, with very good facilities (comparitively). But still, there are bathrooms where sometimes?the showers don't function, the geyser doesn't work, taps are broken or?the AC doesn't work (it's not a luxury, it's really hot here). I know you're probably thinking, <em >big deal?</em> Hold on.

I'm not bitching or moaning. These are little things sane people will normally overlook. If I was in a bad mood and I knew it was because of these little sources of friction, my impatience wouldn't last for long. <em >But that's the thing</em>. These little things are easily overlooked, ignored and forgotten. So in all probability, the person in my story will start out the day in a bad mood, things will go wrong and in the evening he/ she will have no clue as to what went into the making of this horrible day. Friends, professors,?the curriculum?will get the blame while the day could have gone fine <em >had the shower worked!</em>

Far fetched? Simplistic? I'll let you decide. But I urge you to think about it. It does sound absurd. Imagine the person in my story was told that his/ her tests would have been better had the shower worked a few weeks ago. Maybe the person will hit the guy who told him that. Maybe he/ she would patiently explain how his professor is crazy, the tests don't test anything and the course is outdated. All of which may be true. What I'm trying to say is,?these?small irritations may?have the potential to drive large changes,<em > especially because we tend to overlook them</em>. Who can truly say that they have such a positive attitude that they are unaffected by little sources of friction. These problems faced by our friend in India- yes you might roll your eyes when I call them<em > problems</em>- are mostly absent in places like MIT. On the other hand,?someone studying in an?institute lower down the ladder has many more inconveniences to deal with. Does this have any effect on his?<em >performance? Creativity? Drive? Attitude? </em>There are obviously?many examples where no?negative?effect is seen. <em >But what about the cases where there is an effect?</em>

Let's scale up a bit and look at cities. Suppose you want to go from point A to point B, a fairly large distance, in Mumbai, or Bangalore or Chennai. What are your choices?
<ul >
	<li >Public Transport - It's?crowded, the stations too are crowded and dirty, everyone is rude, its hot and uncomfortable.</li>
	<li >Car or worse, bike?- It's a pain to drive in a city, especially a bike.</li>
	<li >Rickshaw - You get ripped off and abused most of the time.</li>
</ul>
Compare this to Singapore (more specifically,?Singapore a decade ago, when it was cheaper). Singapore is a place that should have been like Chennai. But those guys have transformed it.?The buses are air-conditioned. Some stops have fans. Nobody uses the car horn. Everything is squeaky clean- you can sit down at the bus stations. <em >A million irritants less. </em>Could this have a kind of feedback effect, by which I mean, barring a big change, Chennai will get more chaotic and dirty while Singapore will get better and better. <em >The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</em>

How important is <strong >design?</strong>?Vaastu?and Feng?Shui come to my mind. Can a fountain and wind chimes calm you down? Is there a wrong place to build the toilet, or the kitchen, or a window? It probably seems trivial, maybe even frivolous. But consider this-?imagine a life without cupboards, bookshelves and?drawers.?I know from personal experience that organizing becomes a pain when you have one drawer too less. You need to <em >think</em> about how to organize?your stuff.?<em >Details stifle creativity. </em>People confuse design with fashion or bling, but design is something that makes life easier and better.

We already know these things matter.<em > How much?</em> Could be a lot. Maybe in places like?Mumbai the effect is offset by the tremendous opportunities it offers.

<a title="Broken_windows_theory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" target="_blank" >This</a> gets mentioned in Malcolm Gladwell's <em >The Tipping Point</em> where he argues that cleaning up graffiti in the New York subway system led to a reduction in crime.

I came across this article today:?<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html" target="_blank" >Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior</a>

And the responses:

Some guy<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2011/tc20110112_006501.htm" target="_blank" >?Vivek Wadhwa </a>(he's spot on)

and

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/14/american-mothers-superior/" target="_blank" >Why American Mothers are Superior </a>(OK -OK read, techcrunch)

While this isn't strictly related to my post, it fits with the overall theme?that is?the things we take for granted ( or ignore) about? the stuff that goes into?fostering?creativity.
