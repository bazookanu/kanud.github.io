BUT, as the title suggests, this is NOT a funny post. Sorry :)
I have just taken the road more?traveled?by, which leads from science (specializing in quantum mechanics) to management (finance, of course). Therefore the negative post after a long break: I want to capture it all while I'm feeling pissed about it. I'll try to keep the ranting to a minimum.
I have to start off with the tale of Geeta, a professor in a?comparatively?good college in India.
<h2 >What Geeta Did</h2>
Geeta taught a microprocesssor course to this.. friend of mine.
The course was about the Intel 8086 and <em >only</em> about the Intel 8086. Those among you who know a bit about embedded systems will probably find that strange. An introductory course in embedded systems, <em >only about the 8086??</em>For the?uninitiated, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086" >this</a>.
You don't need to understand anything in it, just notice that most of the article is written in the past tense.

The class went through the whole drill. They did timing assembly programming, timing diagrams and believe it or not, <em >interfacing </em>this imaginary chip which they never saw and probably never will see. That's right, they did a course in microprocessors and never laid their eyes on an actual chip. In fact, <strong >they were never even shown a picture of it</strong>. If you ask a guy from this class what the 8086 is, the <em >honest answer</em> would be that it is a rectangle which is sometimes connected to other rectangles through lines or arrows. <em >On paper</em>.?Was there anything practical? Yeah, they used MASM to move numbers from one place to another while the Prof walked around with a smug look on her face (allegedly, I don't know for sure). She was apparently proud for setting a tough question in each "lab session". They ended on a high where they printed "Hello World" on the monitor in various colors.
They had to make the letters blink but nobody could figure out how to do it. The Prof came to the rescue though. No, she had no clue why the letters wouldn't blink. She simply gave everyone marks. This was the final part of a semester-long course on microprocessors, as decided by the Professor, yes a <strong >Professor</strong> with a <strong >PhD </strong>(the thesis was related to electronics, in case you thought otherwise).

When the course structure makes no sense, the evaluation scheme will not make any sense either. How <em >can</em> you judge smart students being forced to do stupid stuff? You reward them for knowing hexadecimal values of instructions and formats of control words (This basically means you need to learn random numbers by heart, a completely useless?exercise, especially for a beginner). You drop "hints" in class?(like an EPROM must always be interfaced at FFFF0- which is not really true) and reward students who write this in the exam. You fuck things up so badly that it is no longer necessary that those who do well in this course would have the first clue about actual, practical embedded programming, nor is it necessary that someone who knows his stuff will automatically do well in this course.

I've asked around and found out that 8086 was taught 25 years ago in Indian colleges. <em >Except then the chip was actually manufactured. </em>So most people did some sort of project in the end. 25 years later, this class did the same thing, except there was no project and basically no useful coding either, because it is impossible to do projects worth doing on a simulator. We can move numbers around though, so that's what they ended up doing. Students who relied on this course (not many, thankfully) <em >are actually less educated than their parents</em>. In a miserable attempt to upgrade the syllabus, the Prof prescribed a textbook which was updated with sections on the 80386 through the Pentium chips. But that is crazy, of course, as it is impossible to finish that in one semester. So only 8086 was taught. Unfortunately, this can't be called a fraud. This is <em >dishonesty of the worst kind</em>.

Small wonder that many "institutes" have mushroomed which offer courses in microcontroller programming and charge hefty fees for them. The courses range from 6 months to 3 days in duration. They do the job our colleges fail to do, which is to teach embedded systems in a way which makes sense. A course 30 hours in duration has the ridiculous price tag of about?<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg.png" alt="Indian Rupee symbol.svg" ></img>?40,000.
No wonder then, with this kind of training in coding, people think it's OK if a program doesn't work as expected, as long as the "<em >logic</em>" is correct. You can see such people in almost all organizations except the very best. They create a piece of code which is usually horrible, when the bugs come up they try to blame the hardware, the compiler or God in general- because nobody has ever made something <em >work </em>before...and they were rewarded for doing it too! The project gets delayed but the delay is expected, as the only reason these people were hired is because they were cheap.

We are forever being <em >prepared </em>to do things, from school to college, instead of actually doing things! Legions of undergrads walk out of college and into the industry thinking that their bosses will <em >teach</em> them how to do things and they will do their job as if it is a homework assignment, with problems falling neatly into categories. Fail!
