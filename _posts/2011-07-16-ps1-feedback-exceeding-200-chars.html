title: PS1 Feedback Exceeding 200 chars

The space on the online form wasn't enough PSD, so I've put in a link to this post instead. I <em >could</em> have written this on the paper form, but it had (113 objective + 5 subjective questions) * 2k forms- not really a way to get my point across.

First of all, the disclaimer, even though I assure you that I have tried my best to be objective in my views:
I didn't really enjoy my PS. I had to travel for more than 5 hours, covering about 80 km a day through the dirtiest parts of my city, in many buses, on a good day. And I had better opportunities which I had to miss because this thing was compulsory. But we did manage to do 2 projects in the end and our report was described as "perfect" by the HRD.

PS1 wasn't a waste. The most important thing I learned was that India was made up of factories and farms and not all bling and IT. It did give me a new perspective on engineering and the business?opportunities here.
But a question nags. Even if PS1 isn't a complete waste, what is its opportunity cost? A lot of us had to forgo doing other things because of this. I have thought and thought for 7 weeks and come to the conclusion that PS1 in its current form has no place in our curriculum if we want to grow at the pace we need to, just like the weird courses in the first 4 semesters (though this has already been changed, I believe).

What can be wrong with processing 2000 kids through some sort of a hacking optimization process into 200 odd organizations? <em >A lot.</em>

While NITs and IITs too have a requirement to do an internship before they pass out, it is not organized by the institutions. The IITians aim high and spam professors at universities abroad and many manage to go abroad. The NITians find something for themselves too. So have many of my friends in state colleges, in their second year itself.
<em >Would it be that hard for us to find internships ourselves?</em>

No, I think.?I guess there is the possibility that some of us might fake employment, as many organizations will be ready to give you a piece of paper certifying that you were an excellent intern for a sum of?<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg.png" alt="Indian Rupee symbol.svg" ></img>?20,000. Most will not even want that much. The work-around seems to be to send a institute-appointed "instructor" to watch over you. A third party, the hand in the sky, where a two-party system has proven sufficient.
<em >How many </em><strong >BITSIANs</strong><em > would fake employment?
</em><em >How many of reports we generate NOW, under this system, have any practical value?</em>

Not many. Not many.
Not to say that <em >nobody</em> has done useful work, just too few. So PS1 cannot be trashed altogether, but it is not the success it appears to be.
Having a network of companies, cutting across industry borders, willing to let us intern is a priceless asset, but it's being used in a very inefficient, pointless way.?Like I said in my<a title="Rats &?Muggas" href="http://kanudeshpande.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/mugg/" > previous post</a>, it's again the problem of being prepared to do things rather than actually doing things!

Add to all this the paradox of paying handsomely to (ideally) work. If only I had?<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg.png" alt="Indian Rupee symbol.svg" ></img>?10 for every person who laughed when he heard we pay to be interns.?A friend told me that it's not necessary that the fee we pay is the cost incurred by the institute for the program. I am fine paying an extra?<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg.png" alt="Indian Rupee symbol.svg" ></img>?2500 every semester, as will most students, as long as it makes sense. Education is not cheap, and we all know <a href="http://www.iitbombay.org/news/Current/education-unbound" >each IITian's education is?subsidized to the tune of?<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg.png" alt="Indian Rupee symbol.svg" ></img>?200,000 per year by the government.</a>

How should the program be restructured? Here's my opinion:
<ol >
	<li >Rather than forcing students to get internships through the?institute, give us the choice to opt out. The PS system isn't like the mess system where the option of opting out can make it collapse. The institute can definitely <em >help </em>students who want to apply through the college.</li>
	<li >The role of the instructor is to make sure interns don't slack off. This can easily be done by giving managers a small form at the end of PS and then ask them to seal it in an envelope. This system is followed to verify references of students in university applications. <em >It can even be made online.</em>?Why can't it be used here? This is more of an incentive to do work than diaries, tests and whatnot.
Another option is to have a list of "trusted" organizations. The student gets credit if she interns in these organizations, any time during her academic life (This system is followed abroad).</li>
	<li >A lot of stations, especially the factories, have the concept of "Industrial Training" rather than internships. In my opinion, these factories are the only places that make PS worth the effort. This bit can be easily moved to the first summer rather than the second. The duration can also be shortened to half (the organizations prefer this, I think). After that, the student can be given the option to do a project, for which he/she can gain credits.</li>
</ol>
<div >This is only my opinion, but it's easy to see how this can cut costs and paperwork, while increasing our own satisfaction, and most importantly, our <em >reputation.?</em></div>
