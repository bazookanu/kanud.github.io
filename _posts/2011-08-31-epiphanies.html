title: Epiphanies
---
The first epiphany I remember having happened when I was 13. It's this incredibly strange thing- I'm just sitting there, quietly and I suddenly think, <em ><strong >damn!</strong>
Everything I've done till now was so stupid! I'm so much smarter now!
</em>If I could go outside my body and watch myself thinking this way, I'd probably see this as my slow descent to madness.
And it happens every damn year. Like clockwork. One fine day, every year, I will honestly and sincerely start believing that <em >everything</em> I did in my life, till now, is stupid, and I'm much smarter now. Exponentially smarter.

OK, not <em >everything</em>. But let's come back to that later.

In college it seems to happen more than once a year. But once you've ruled out reactions to hallucinatory drugs, the once-a-year law holds.I keed :D Anyway, back to the topic:

1. If one assumes that the epiphany is sham, there's no problem at all. You can have them any number of times and it really won't mean anything- a reaction to hallucinogens, maybe, or deranged thinking after being awake for 80 hours.
But I can't assume that! Because these happen when I'm sane and calm. So assuming the epiphany is <em >for?real</em>, it seems that it's the sudden realization of how much smarter one has become over the last year. That means I'm smarter by a factor of exp(k*8) or approximately 2981 (keeping k=1, yes, it's a stupid leap, so what) times as smart as I was when I was 13. A more illuminating statement would be I was 2981 times as stupid as I am now, as at no point during the given 8 years (and counting) was I exceptionally brilliant. Yeah, I don't hold any fantasies about such things.

Another way to look at it is that stupidity comes in fragments. That way you can get an epiphany each time you become smart in just one area.

2. Another reason why I think the epiphanies signify something is because things change (for the better?) ?after I've had them. It's not the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc- things don't change <em >because </em>of the epiphany, things change in their own fashion and that just gets highlighted, I guess.

The distinguishing factor here is that one thinks everything one has done before the said episode seems stupid. Of course that's not completely true, some things cannot be called stupid anyway you look at them. Winning a Nobel for example. So to avoid epiphanies (which,after all, ideally, are not desirable), (and be in a state akin to stable growth in economics) (sorry for the multiple bracketed comments) you either:
<em >do a lot of things right,
</em>or
<em >don't do a lot of things wrong.</em>

Both are quite hard to achieve, if you think about it.

What I'm trying to say is <em >I wanna kill this damn blog! It's fucking <strong >stupid</strong>!</em>

Easy enough, except this blog has survived two other such death threats. It came back leaner each time, but it came back. Plus, not everything about this is stupid. I think.

Fuck, fuck, fuck I need a break.
