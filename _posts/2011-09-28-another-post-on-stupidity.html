title: Another Post On Stupidity
---
Nobody likes to read something which implies, however subtly, however <em >improbably,</em>?the reader's stupidity. I saw that after my last post. Normally, about half the people who stumble on my blog click their way to the home page, and about a fourth read other posts (I am surprised each time that happens). Last post, less than 20% went to the home page and just a couple read other posts :D
I am inclined to blame other factors, but the drop is too high and the pattern was too consistent before this.
Still, this is all I want to say for now, so I'm going to say it: <em >a lot of people in BITS are somewhat stupid. </em>You guys drove me crazy with all the money talk and now its the <strong >new?grading system.</strong>

<strong ></strong>To make myself look even more stuck-up and condescending, I will break it down for you in points, again:
<ul >
	<li >The average of all CGPA s isn't likely to change. If it changes, and we can be quite certain about this, it will be very little. Especially looking at the fact that nothing was mentioned about this. Which means,</li>
	<li >For every guy whose grade improves, there will be a guy whose grade deteriorates. Or, on an average, for every course where your grade improves, there will be a course where your grade goes down. Hoping that your grades will only improve is like:</li>
</ul>
<ol >
	<li >hoping for a high PR number in all semesters or like,</li>
	<li >hoping to win a slightly generous lottery.
It can happen, but you should know from your experience that it usually doesn't.</li>
</ol>
<ul >
	<li >So to all the people who crib that they missed grade 'X' by 'n' marks, you shall now crib about how you missed grade 'Y' by 'm' marks. In other words, your cribbing isn't a function of what grade you miss or by how many marks. You will crib on regardless, because you<em > like</em> to crib.</li>
</ul>
<div >If you really think about it, all the new grading system can do is make everyone more competitive- because you cannot be as certain that your grade is stuck after T2. Therefore it isn't really as "fair" as it appears to be. And if you <em >really</em> think about it, it's natural (for me at least) to think you deserve a grade which you <em >just got</em> and also to think that you deserved a grade which you <em >just missed</em>, but maybe, you always deserved <em >exactly what you got</em>. Meh. Just saying.</div>
