title: Death

<del >This is my final post on this blog. I had written earlier that I wont kill this one, but this feels like a natural death rather than a murder :)</del>

<del >I feel now, that it's somewhat pretentious to have a blog filled with just my opinions. Why on earth are they important enough to be stored in one place, tagged, categorized and be searchable? Besides, wordpress is too annoying. It's awesome if you're hosting your own website, but it sucks as a blogging platform, especially commenting, and the design in general. Blogspot has become so much better this week- really beautiful themes. So I wondered if I should shift there, but in the end I felt that too is unnecessary. What I really hope for, my best-outcome scenario, is a discussion. Blogspot will probably be well integrated with google+ in the near future, but it's still an impediment as far as triggering a discussion is concerned. My random thoughts are simply not interesting and profound enough to warrant any extra clicks. My new blogging platform is therefore, google+. It makes a tonne of sense. With things like greplin, there seems to be less and less extra stuff that a personal blog offers over social network updates.</del>

<del >It was good while it lasted. I write much better now. So I guess the blog outlived its purpose.</del>



<del >Ciao!</del>
