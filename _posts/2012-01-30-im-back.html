title: I'm Back...
---
Bichezzz. Like in the soap operas of the early 2000s. Slightly embarrassing. But I'm back.

Hell why, you ask? Firstly, my prediction than G+ will become hot, on campus at least turned out to be completely wrong. They actually unblocked facebook. I'm probably the only one here who isn't happy/ does not use facebook now. It's full of uncool people who are too boring to stalk. Secondly, my plans to get my own website collapsed right after I realized that my knowledge of C, C++ and Java won't go far in getting it up and running. I am aware the previous sentence will probably halve my potential readers.?I am aware the previous sentence will probably halve my potential readers.?I am aware the previous sentence will probably halve my potential readers. And now we're down to fractions.

One prediction that <em >was </em>right was the one about the finer grading system being completely useless. It would have been even better had the CGPA list been out, we could all savor the <em >oh-shit</em>?moment on seeing math/logic in action. I missed doing that kind of thing.
