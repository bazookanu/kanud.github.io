title: The Bald Man and the Rat
---
?We can show you how to go to America,? said the Bald Man on stage (the country's biggest) and positively radiated with confidence and benevolence as he said so. The thousand Rats in attendance responded by moving their little paws in a frenzied applause. They had always wanted to go to America as far back as they could remember. But then they had a really short memory when it came to remembering things like the date since they had started yearning for America. The date in question, in fact, was very recent for most of them. This was puzzling behavior, as otherwise the Rats had wonderfully retentive minds.

Ramesh was among the thousand Rats who had ended up in the house of the Bald Man to learn the subtle science of going to America. He was skeptical whether the Bald Man actually knew the short way to America, let alone the matter of showing it to others. His fears were blown away through the sheer, quiet, powerful force of the Bald Man?s words. Ramesh had never been skeptical about America and its infinite cheese factories, though. This too was puzzling behavior, as otherwise the Ramesh was quite analytical and argumentative.

Ramesh had a lot of fun in the months that followed. There were many Rats like him here. They had all toiled torturously long and hard to prove to the Bald Men that they were worthy of knowing the short way to America. Coupled with the certainty that they would soon have the knowledge was their new-found freedom, and they felt nothing could stop them now. Ramesh also got to know Suresh, who had come here a year ago. Suresh was really smart and friendly. But he was moody and got into all sorts of trouble with the Bald Man for smoking hallucinatory substances. When Ramesh enquired, he said he needed it. Ramesh didn?t press further.

The Bald Man, meanwhile, kept running the Rats through mazes, all the time telling them this would prepare them for comprehending the directions to America. Nobody bothered asking how. Eternal Hell was promised for the Rats who showed a lack of interest in solving the mazes, because the Rats did grow tired after a while. Ramesh grumbled about this strange preparation. He had expected that someone would just give him shoes, a map showing the way and a key to read the map. This was nothing like it. But he never said anything to the Bald Man. The Bald Man scared him a little.

One day, when he was chatting with Suresh at their favorite cafe, he mentioned about how he hated the mazes. How would they ever help him in getting to America? Suresh was smoking weed and had a glass of Scotch in his hand. Ramesh contented himself with a Coke. He sipped some of it and added that all the other Rats he knew under the tutelage of other Bald Men were doing the same thing.

?The mazes won?t help. The Bald Man knows as much as you about the way to America. He just did this to earn his living.?

?<em >How high are you man?</em>?

Ramesh said that but Suresh had just scared the hell out of him. Ramesh had been suspecting the same thing of late, but had dismissed such thoughts as fatalistic. In spite of himself, he felt the need to ask.

?So what, you know how to get there??

?Yeah.?

Ramesh waited. Suresh said nothing.

?How??

Suresh was being unnecessarily dramatic, Ramesh thought.

?You just have to swim there.?

?That?s <em >preposterous</em>! The whole point we came here was to learn a better way!?

?Yeah? Did any of the Bald Men promise you that??

Ramesh reeled under the impact.

?<em >No</em>, but why do all these Rats come here if the Bald Man knows nothing??

?They?re all Rats. Like you.?

At this point Ramesh noticed that Suresh was looking less Rat-like. He looked like his hair was?molting away. His paws had grown larger. He somewhat looked like a hairy Man.

?Give me that.?

Suresh smiled and passed him the joint. Ramesh took a puff and the world was beautiful again. It was a little scary in its beauty.

?So you just swim there.?

As he said this he realized his laziness had prevented him from realizing this obvious fact. At the same time, a pair of little bumps started materializing in his crotch.

?Yeah. You just swim there.?
