title: The Curious Case of VLS Finance
---
VLS Finance, right now, is <em >the</em>?penny stock. Everyone's excited about it because in the last month it went from Rs. 10 to above Rs. 20. A return of about 140% in a few weeks! Super exciting! So I did some research. And?I won't lie, I'm writing this post to see how many hits I get. ?Let me categorically state, believe nothing of what follows.

Basics first. Face value is Rs. 10. Promoters hold 38% and public holds 53%. Which is kind of shady. Fundamentals- not very consistent. So it doesn't look like a good stock to buy. But then things get interesting.

<img title="VLS Finance Historical Chart" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83489788/vlschart.png" width="100%" ></img></a>

The chart is from<a href="http://www.icharts.in/" > icharts</a> , really nice site btw.
Anyway, look at what happened in 2008. Naturally people are excited. So what's driving the rally?

At the heart of it all is Chiddu. Yeah! The academic-looking ex-Finance Minister we all loved is...shady? Look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Chidambaram#Controversies_and_Allegations" >wiki page</a>?of his controversies!

But what is not mentioned there is his alleged hand in the withdrawal of 3 FIRs against??S P Gupta, Chairman, Sunair Hotels Limited.

Sunair Hotels is the owner of the apparently 5-star <a href="http://hotelmetdelhi.com/" >Metropolitan Hotel</a>.<a href="http://hotelmetdelhi.com/" >
</a>Yeah, looking at that site, I'm not too sure about the stars either.

VLS Finance currently owns 24% of Sunair Hotels. But it<em > thinks</em> it should actually own upwards of 80%. That would make it worth about twice, thrice, ten times...I don't know! An impressive multiple of what it is now.

Back in 2001, VLS finance had alleged before the Company Law Board that Sunair Hotels had<em > fraudulently</em> allotted shares to others and sought cancellation of the allotment (Gupta and VLS started Sunair together). Sunair had some counter allegations, about a breach of an MOU signed between them. The CLB declined to declare the shares null, but gave VLS the option of getting out of its investment, with the price of the shares being fixed by some independent body. VLS didn't exercise that option.

I don't know what exactly happened between 2001 and 2007, but January 10, 2008 was the date of the Delhi High Court judgement on the case of VLS Finance and...I know your thinking Sunair, but it was the <strong >Government of Delhi</strong>! VLS had filed 3 FIRs against S.P Gupta. Further, it alleged that the Delhi government failed to discharge its <em >statutory responsibility </em>and allowed Sunair to conduct dealings on disputed property. The Delhi government said there was not enough evidence against Sunair to pursue the cases filed by VLS. The petition was dismissed, and the share fell off a cliff.

Enter 2011. BJP is clamoring for Chiddu's head. Pranab da says something bad about him. Plus, it turns out that S. P. Gupta used to be Chiddu's client. So along with 2G and Pranab da's views, BJP mixes this in and throws it all at him. Chiddu denies everything and says he hasn't met this guy for over a decade.

Finally, in December 2011, the Delhi government suddenly changes its mind and says there is indeed enough evidence to pursue cases against S.P. Gupta. For, by the looks of it, misusing Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi's name, stealing from the government, cutting down forest trees, killing calves and whatnot. S.P. Gupta has hit back with charges of torture. A Delhi Court has fixed the matter for hearing <em >today, March 7.?</em>If the case looks in VLS' favor, there are rumors that the price could hit triple digits. So after partial profit-booking at the Rs. 20 level, a lot of money is waiting to burst out of the floodgates one way or another. Crazy!

What makes it even more compelling is that VLS Finance has a Board filled with powerful-looking people.
Former Defence Secretary, Former Finance Secretary, Former Industry Secretary and Former Chairman, Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). Former Chief Election Commissioner. Former Chairman of LIC. Former President, ICAI.?Former Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh. ?Former Ambassador from India to Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and Czechoslovakia.
And a lot of "current" people too.
Add to that VLS' 14% stake in Relaxo footwear, among other genuine companies.

Of course, nobody really knows what's happening. But a lot of people won't be getting any sleep tonight.

<em ><strong >March 9 update:?</strong>The share price has dropped by some 10% since March 7, the supposed hearing date. I have no idea if the hearing happened or not. Like I've written in the post, the legal battle started before 2001 at least. It's a mess! There are a lot of cases and even more petitioners and respondents (yeah, they are different in different cases, not just S.P Gupta and VLS). It's hard to piece together the whole picture, especially so because I have no background in law. It's nice that all these things are being put up online by the courts but it's hard to figure out anything?unless you know exactly what you want.</em>
