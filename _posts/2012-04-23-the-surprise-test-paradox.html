title: The Surprise Test Paradox
---
Suppose your teacher announces there will be a surprise test this week and you have a 5 day week- Monday to Friday.

Now the test can't be on Friday, because it wouldn't be a surprise then. So Friday's ruled out.
If Friday's out, the test can't be on Thursday either. Because it wouldn't be a surprise. So Thursday's out as well. If Thursday's out, so is Wednesday and then Tuesday and Monday go as well.
There can be no surprise test. It won't be a surprise.

I confess I cannot quite resolve this. I've felt like I've come close to it, many times over the last... 4 years. Yes, that probably makes me quite retarded.

I think this problem can be resolved if the teacher keeps the number of tests undecided. So there could be 5 tests or even no test. If someone can figure this out... you have my goodwill.
