It's that time of the year again. Some guy came to me for advice regarding engineering admissions, so I thought I should write a post. It's easy to forget how (naive) we were before we signed up for engineering. I remember because I wrote some of it down.

Hm. Here's a pic:

But the problem is much worse!

I'll be honest: 3 years ago, this is what I thought about engineering and my future in college:
<ol >
	<li >It would be cool, as the image above suggests</li>
	<li >It would be an extension of high school- physics, math and a little chemistry chopped up into so many courses</li>
	<li >It was theoretically possible for me to win a Nobel, by launching into a career of research on quantum mechanics</li>
	<li >Everybody there, students and professors, would be deeply interested in what they are doing</li>
	<li >Everything taught would have some direct application in real life</li>
</ol>
After 3 years I have learned that I'm not alone to have my (hysterically cute) my hopes die, which sometimes was painless and perfunctory while disillusioning?at other times. It was?<em >fun?</em>in the end, and you do learn <em >something</em>, just not what you expected.

To reiterate, the problem is a lot worse than students having a larger-than-life expectation of what engineering is.
The big problem is, for almost 4 years prior to admission, all students do is Physics, Maths and Chemistry (notice the caps) which I feel leads to a mostly binary view of the world (Chemistry doesn't count of course, it's just?<em >mugging</em>). I find students fall into 3 major categories after the results come out:
<ul >
	<li ><strong >The High Rankers</strong>
These are the guys with the good scores. They can get any course they want, so?they obviously decide on Computer Science or Electronics.</li>
	<li ><strong >The People Who Like?</strong><strong >Physics</strong>
<strong >?</strong>Or Maths. If they have the scores, they go for Electrical or Mechanical engineering, depending on which chapters they 'liked' in high school. If they don't have the scores, they want to go for courses which sound closest to what they like. A physics liker, for example, will find Industrial Physics (or whatever) attractive.</li>
	<li ><strong >The Reality-Distortioners
</strong>I like these guys, they're hilarious. They either don't like what they did for the last 2 years, or they have moderate to bad scores, or both. They decide they're interested in some relatively obscure area. <em >Aeronautics</em>, for some unfathomable reason, seems to be the preferred obscure field.</li>
</ul>
Some honest people, of course, decide to go with the flow and not worry too much about it. But in the end a lot of people fall into the 3 categories, even the I'll-take-what-life-gives-me-but-I'll-work-on-what-interests-me types. It's almost like there's a strange force forcing people into these molds.
I, for example, had been coding for 4 years (nothing great, but not unremarkable either) and I was pretty good at it too. I made a chat program for my 12th grade project. However, I had no idea about real development and imagined it to be 20% interesting algorithms and 80% designing menus. It was simply inconceivable that I would be better off learning computer science rather than something more "real" and "related" to Physics, like Electronics. I could always code on the side, I thought. I have come to realize many people employ such flawed reasoning.

Here's the truth. Everything you, prospective engineering undergrad, know about the Universe is flawed and faulty. The engineering bit of Engineering is disappointing at best. You will feel like you were ripped out of Flatland and thrown into 13-dimensional space.

It's astonishing, but even after entering Engineering life in earnest, there are people who try to figure out if they like something based on the emotional appeal of say, attaching wires on a breadboard. It's sad and dangerous.

The problem is simple- most of us haven't done a worthwhile<strong > project</strong>. The solution is also very simple: <strong >do projects</strong>. Until then, there's no way to figure out what you like and a bunch of courses will not go a long way in helping you figure it out.

When you actually do something worthwhile, you definitely won't be enjoying every second of it. You might feel like quitting or compromising in the middle. Attaching the wires will probably be the most irritating and insignificant part of the job. What finally comes out of the whole effort-?<em >that's?</em>the interesting part. <em >That</em> is the moment when you can decide whether you?<em >like?</em>something. Not before that.

Coming to the actual advice bit of this post:
<ol >
	<li >Don't fall into one of the 3 categories.?Don't make an emotional decision based on what you think you will like, especially when you don't know what the courses are really about.</li>
	<li >Research on the college. Read the course descriptions carefully. They will make the courses appear 10 times more attractive than they actually are. Check if the faculty is doing any research and make sure it's worthwhile research.</li>
	<li >If you don't like what you find after doing the above point, check the placements. Sometimes, a college can have average placements now, but remember you will get placed 4 years later. Therefore, faculty and courses should be given first priority.</li>
	<li >Don't be overly swayed by claims of university affiliations and industry links. These things are obviously good, but more often than not they are somewhat dubious.</li>
	<li >Talk to students, but take what they say with a pinch of salt. Most students will never badmouth their own college.</li>
</ol>
