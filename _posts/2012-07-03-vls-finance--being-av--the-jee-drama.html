title: VLS Finance , Being Av+ , The JEE Drama
---
<h2 >VLS Finance</h2>
To the investors in this stock who looked to me for <a href="http://kanudeshpande.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/the-curious-case-of-vls-finance/" >advice</a>: Why in the world would you buy 2000 shares of VLS Finance, at?<em >any?</em>price? Why would you base your investment decisions on advice from unverified sources and blogs written by engineering students?
This was the first time I really felt fear and greed while trading. Lesson learned:

1. Never listen to anyone but yourself when investing
2. Don't invest in things you don't understand

VLS Finance- stuck in a labyrinth of court cases, most of which seem to be castles on air. Multibagger my blooming ass. I feel ashamed reading my last post now. There are hundreds of mirages in the market like this one. Investing in such things based on 'info' you can find online is sheer folly.
<h2 >Av+</h2>
But does that mean you should sell this crap if you had bought it? I would passionately agree, had I not seen S.P Tulsian (yes that annoying-looking guy who comes on CNBC) make money on Kingfisher Airlines. There are many roads that lead to money.
What <em >is</em> the stock market all about? In a true BITSIAN epiphany, I realized it's the ultimate quest of being av+. Av being the market price- can you somehow, by hook or crook, by analysis or mostly by fluke bluff the market price and make some money? I've found a legitimate reason for my in-the-process-of-becoming-unhealthy obsession with the stock market. It's BITS' fault.

Another thing that's BITS' fault is the GDP growth of this great nation. Despite <a href="http://kanudeshpande.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/what-sorcery-is-this/" >exhorting</a> my batch mates to put country before self, they couldn't look beyond their petty concerns. Now everyone is safely blaming Pranab da. I know he's out of the FinMin people, but it was never his fault! I will author a paper on this strange <a href="http://kanudeshpande.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/what-sorcery-is-this/" >correlation</a> soon.
<h2 >The Morons in IITs</h2>
This JEE drama made me <em >puke</em>- the professors and distinguished alumni (like the great Chetan Bhagat) with their ideas of measuring "innate intelligence" and worries about the "poor quality" of students who will enter IITs soon. Here's my question- isn't the top 2% of the country, measured by <em >any</em> process, <em >any?</em>marginally fair process, good enough for you?

There's no doubt that the weighted average process proposed earlier was unfair, but I cannot envision a formula better than the one being proposed now. I didn't see the stakeholders of the IITs jump up in quite the same fashion- at the unfairness of it all, or at the alleged breaching of autonomy, during the 27% quota controversy.

The whole thing reeks of a 'club' mentality- <em >IIT is a fraternity</em>, not a place where the toughest engineering problems are solved. There's no reason that the IITs must have the country's top talent in balancing equations and drawing free-body diagrams problems apart from just that- <em >the IITs must have the country's top talent in balancing equations and drawing free-body diagrams!</em>

<em ></em>What paradigm-changing stuff do you plan to do with these 8000 people? <em >What problems are you going to solve for India?</em> What is the nature of these things you are doing that absolutely requires ranks 1 to 8000, and ranks 9189 or 16087 just won't do- out of ?a<em > million</em>? Shouldn't the government worry about whether the process is fair enough for the people to accept- as long as you still get the best students India has to offer? I have a feeling you could do the exact same things you're doing with the 98th percentile, with the 90th percentile.

What is really unfair is that there are so few places where we think we can get quality education. That's a cancer. Instead we are hell-bent on treating a hiccup first- the admission procedure, simply so that the exclusivity of Club IIT ?be preserved.
