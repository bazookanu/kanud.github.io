title: Oh, VLS Finance! ;)
---
The stock "rallied" 9% yesterday, giving me the perfect opportunity to do some social service. Already there are search terms leading to my <a href="http://kanudeshpande.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/the-curious-case-of-vls-finance/" >previous post</a> and my blog ranks second when you do a blog search for VLS Finance.

I won't explain how much the fundamentals suck. Just look at the shareholding pattern: over 40% owned by small retail investors and over 50% owned by all retail investors. Therefore,

<em >A. If this stock really did have any value, there would be more rich people owning it.
B. These guys can descend on the market- hard!- at any time</em>. Then there'll be a circuit breaker, but basically you're screwed if you haven't sold. I mean, people have bought this stock at prices ranging from Rs. 15 to Rs. 450.

The current volume is maybe 2% of the shares held by these retail investors. It won't take a couple of genius operators to jack up the price by 9%, which is just over a rupee. There are plenty of naive people to take it up from there- especially seeing that the stock has done remarkable things like 45% returns in a week and 100% returns in a month.

The court cases are a sham in my judgment. If you are going to buy this stock, don't fool yourself for even a minute that you know why it's going up or down. It is possible to make some money, but it's a gamble. Have some fun, but don't get serious. And if you own some shares (especially those who bought at Rs. 15-20 levels), start selling.
