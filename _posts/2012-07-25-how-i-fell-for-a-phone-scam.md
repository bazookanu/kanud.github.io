title: How I Fell for a Phone Scam
---
It was nearly 1 AM. My neighbor's dog has taken to incessantly barking from around 12.30 to 2.30 AM, so falling asleep at my usual time is impossible. I was contemplating going up to my terrace and throwing stones at the dog when I get a call from this number: +85099930512

Naturally, I had no idea who would call me at this time or which state the number belonged to. Did I say state? It's a different country! <strong >North Korea</strong>, google tells me.

At this point it would have been smart to probe a bit more. But my brain, emboldened after fantasies of throwing stones at my neighbor's mad dog at 1 AM, came up with a better explanation. It pains me to admit this, but at that time my working theory was that some North Korean prisoners had somehow gained access to the prison's only phone and were randomly dialing numbers, hoping for international help. Suitably excited, I called back.

There's this girl talking in Hindi. I changed my theory to accommodate this new fact. Obviously the chick works for RAW. I hear a guy's voice. This is definitely some James Bond shit going on here. I listened to the guy and girl talk for about a minute, and till the end I had no idea what they were going on about.<em > I hang up and I get a bill for Rs. 70.</em>

Long story short,<a href="http://www.the-scream.co.uk/forums/t30442.html" > this is a common scam for retards</a> like me. People buy these networks and get paid for anything that happens on them. In order to stop feeling more idiotic, I will not point out the obvious and skip the part where I implore you not to return calls from North Korean numbers at 1 AM in the morning.
