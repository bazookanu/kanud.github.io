Somewhat in the style of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CF0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblakemasters.tumblr.com%2F&ei=0cwkUMrNHsrNrQfW24CoBw&usg=AFQjCNG8MnS6BJYggNYNkoBCa_TPgaulAg" >that guy from Stanford</a>, I?ve thought of putting up my <a href="http://celbits.org/nvc.php" >NVC</a> class notes online and see how it pans out. I?m not spending a lot of time on this, so pardon my incoherence or grammatical errors. Also, these are <em >my</em> notes, so please appreciate there may be errors in my understanding.
This week?s speaker was <a href="twitter.com/mukund" >Mukund Mohan</a>, speaking on how to go from idea to opportunity.
<h3 >Look for Problems</h3>
Mukund started off with the obvious- look for problems, big or small, that you have or other people have. Then ask yourself three questions:
? Why is this being done the way it?s being done?
? Can it be better?
? Can it be cheaper?

Micromax, for instance, asked themselves what people in India like to do with their smartphones. It turned out they were interested mainly in taking pictures and some internet activity, and were not too interested in apps. One thing they really liked was taking pictures and sharing them online.
They asked themselves: can smartphones be cheaper?
They fitted their phones with low resolution cameras- cheap- and set up a server so that these pictures look better before they are shared online. It was cheaper to do this than give each phone a high-resolution camera. Their phone could do what Indians wanted to do cheaper than other smartphones.
<h3 >Viability of your Product</h3>
Your product can soothe three kinds of pain:
? Obvious pain- a headache cured by crocin
? Latent pain- such as that cured by a smartphone
? Unknown pain- pain you have become used to
There are many ways to find the viability of your product, depending on its nature:
? using google ads for an ad campaign
? surveymonkey for surveys
? getting feedback on a prototype
? in-depth interviews with customers
He also talked about how hackerstreet could be the first place to get some customer engagement in India.
An imprecise rule to decide whether you ought to go ahead with your idea is if at least 0.01% of your target market gives you positive feedback- if your market has a million customers, you should have a hundred positive opinions.
What if you discover, during your research, that you can solve a generic problem for a lot of people or a specific, deep pain point for fewer people?
While there is some value in being the best in a narrow area, this is something you have to decide yourself.
<h3 >Competition</h3>
Competition should not be a major factor influencing your product. These influencing factors ought to be your passion for your product and knowledge of your market.
Should you talk to people or work in stealth mode?
While there are two schools of thought on this issue, it may make sense to talk to as many people as you can. This way, your idea evolves.
<h3 >The Internet</h3>
The internet has compressed time scales- while earlier six months was short term, a year was medium term and five years was long term, it has now scaled down to a day, a week and a month. In such a scenario, it makes sense to start small and keep shipping (even if your product is bad).
<h3 >
Reasons Why Startups Fail</h3>
The first and obvious reason is lack of money, but the zeroth reason is lack of focus.
