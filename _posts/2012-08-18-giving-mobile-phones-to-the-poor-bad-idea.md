title: "Giving Mobile Phones to the Poor: Bad Idea?"
---
'A mobile phone for every Indian!' says Manmohan (or was it Sonia?). The phones apparently cost a thousand rupees each and come with two hundred rupees worth of talk time. There are seventy million BPL persons in India eligible for this scheme, so BOOM! <em >Eight to nine thousand crore rupees!</em> BAD IDEA! The economy is in a bad state! We can't afford this!

I love this idea for two reasons:
<ul >
	<li >Obviously, this is a rather smart move to gain political mileage before elections. This move is different, however, from the schemes we've had over the years-
<ul >
	<li >Farm loan waivers</li>
	<li >Free food</li>
	<li >Free gold</li>
</ul>
Schemes such as these assume a very wrong thing: that there are <em >X</em> amount of resources- money, gold, food- and through some aberration the rich got more of it than the poor. So let's give some of it back to the poor!
What matters is the <em >ability</em> to <em >generate </em>food, gold and wealth. A mobile phone dole is actually the distribution of this ability- a means of empowerment. <em >Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, but teach him how to fish and you feed him for life.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul >
	<li >There is no value in wealth just sitting under your pillow. <em >Wealth needs to generate more wealth.</em> The government is essentially loaning nine thousand crore rupees to the poor. What is the rate of return? Can the poor add a couple of hundred rupees to the economy every year in return for their phones? I believe so. I can't think of a better place to invest nine thousand crore rupees.</li>
</ul>
There are things that could go wrong, of course. The poor might just sell the phones. The phones might not reach the poor in the first place. What happens when talk time is over? A million things could go wrong. However, I'm sure that the benefits of connectivity will outweigh such concerns. The idea could be streamlined- why not test it out for small populations first and study the benefits? Such scientific processes cannot be expected from a coalition wanting instant returns, but one can always hope.

Like every idea that's good for India (like Aadhar for instance), this idea too is being opposed by P. Chidambaram. The markets, this time, will love him for it. It's short-term thinking. With so many people questioning the India growth story, maybe this is the one of the decisive reforms that the country needs to truly grow, inclusively.
