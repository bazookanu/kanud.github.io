Meanwhile, I've started reading a lot about Warren Buffet :)

I sold Geometric, bought and sold ICICI, bought 3M and more Jyothy Laboratories in between my <a href="http://kanudeshpande.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/small-joys/" >last post</a> and this.

And the reason for this post: Jyothy Laboratories- I love this stock and I think it's got a lot of steam left.
