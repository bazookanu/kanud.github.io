title: Co-brothers, dashes and semicolons
---
<a href="http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Word_Power_Made_Easy.html?id=W2lVHktWAuEC&redir_esc=y" >Norman Lewis</a> defines correct English as that which is deemed acceptable by the educated majority. This, I think, is awesome. It's like a feedback mechanism- if the language strays too far from the people, it changes. Exceptions are made to rules and the rules keep changing. Maybe this is why the language survives and thrives; I find Indian languages somewhat rigid in this aspect.

I have two questions:
<ol >
	<li >Is it all right to call your brother-in-law a co-brother?</li>
	<li >Should semicolons and colons be replaced by dashes?</li>
</ol>
Usage of the semicolon is <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/semicolon" >well defined</a>. I'm sure that holds true for the dash as well. The minimalist in me, however, feels that the dash can take up the role of the colon and semicolon.

I was thinking of writing a few examples, but I'm too jaded right now to think of appropriate ones, so please go ahead and think of ways in which I could be right.
I will say this- the issue is mainly about how long you want to pause between the two sentences you're joining. I, for one, don't pause differently for a semicolon than a dash. The pause is probably more dependent on the context than a rule that semicolons have a shorter pause (or whatever).

<strong >Co-brother,?</strong>on the other hand, simply sounds wrong. If co-founders split the role of foundership, then co-brothers must somehow be sharing brotherhood. But they are not. I don't care. There are lots of examples in English where things don't make sense they way they are supposed to make sense (again, feel free to think of examples). Plus, I would love an Indian contribution to English that is not uncool like 'chicken tikka' , not lame like 'bangalored' and not Americanized like 'mantra'.
