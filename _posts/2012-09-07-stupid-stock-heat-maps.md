title: Stupid Stock Heat Maps!

You know the ones I mean:

I don't understand how these things are expected to help me visualize anything! Looking at the one above I can, <em >at best</em>, understand that people are talking a lot more about Apple than Google or MS or Zynga- but that's it! What is the point of the hundred other red and green rectangles on it? The same information could have been conveyed with <strong >simple text</strong>.

Even worse are portfolio visualizations:

Absolutely pointless. It's near impossible to discern anything from this map- unless you have a ruler and calculator in hand.
You can figure out neither your absolute investment in a stock, nor the relative investment compared to another stock. They're damn rectangles with varying dimensions- nothing fixed to serve for comparison.
You can't figure out if you're in profit or loss for the day, because you have to add up the green rectangles and the red rectangles and <em >then</em> compare them.

The worst part is that the visualization changes every time there is a tiny movement in any stock! Suddenly you could find that ICICI went from being a square in to top right corner to an elongated rectangle at the bottom. So you can't even tell the relative movements in a stock over time- because there is absolutely no<em > fixed point</em> in this stupid visualization, in space or time. It's a million times worse than a 3d pie chart.

I have no idea why these are still around. It's cool that someone created this optimization algorithm to fit little rectangles into a large rectangle, but get the hell over it! Plain text can convey more information in a better way compared to maps like these. If the reason these are there is that they add color to an otherwise drab page, even little circles of different sizes are better visualizations- use them instead.
