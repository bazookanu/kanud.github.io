title: An Evolutionary Reason to (what we think is) Good Looks?
---
I guess most of us have experienced this- your voice sounds different in your head than what comes out of your mouth.

Everybody knows why, of course; the waves bounce around in your head in a medium that's not air- which possible attenuates different frequencies differently. So I got this mind-blown moment thinking about this over dinner. I have done no research on this, so bear with me if it sounds far fetched.

Let's say there's a guy who, <em >in his head</em>, sounds like Morgan Freeman. He'll talk in a manner befitting his perceived voice- like Morgan Freeman talks, except he won't sound anything like him, because he has a high-pitched, loud and raspy voice. Everybody will think he's an idiot. ( To imagine how this will look like, think of Hrithik Roshan trying to mimic Morgan Freeman. Think of <em >anyone</em> mimicking Morgan Freeman! Except maybe Alan Rickman.)

My hypothesis is, this guy is probably not perceived as good-looking. Why? What if the shape of your skull determined how you sound inside your head? A good-looking skull would then give you a sound closer to what you 'actually' sound like, leading to you talking in a way complementing your voice, leading to you not looking like an idiot.

Naturally, now I'm wondering if human good-looks are all by-products of feedback mechanisms like this. If you actually walk the way you think you walk, maybe you can improve the way you walk over time. If not, what if you introduce weird changes to your stride, become ungainly and later get out-runned by everyone in your tribe as you try to escape a man-eating tiger?

Like I said, mind=blown.
