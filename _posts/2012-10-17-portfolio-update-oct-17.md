Yup, only 4 stocks.

I've bought more 3M, Lupin and Jyothy Labs from the proceeds of selling Cipla, Hexaware and Mindtree. Selling Hexaware and Mindtree seem to be correct decisions (at least for now). I had too few Cipla stocks, so I sold them just to simplify things.

I'm giving minimal attention to my portfolio, which is what I had planned to do anyway. I guess I'm missing out on a lot of action since the last few weeks, yet- it seems to be working out fine! It's not much of an improvement from my last update but I'm still outperforming the indices, although not by a lot. The low churn rate has substantially reduced my brokerage costs.

Meanwhile, my bank keeps calling me, urging me to try out margin trading. They've introduced some weekly square-off option (opposed to daily) and slashed their fees. And I guess their weekly calls are turning profit. Or do they just want me to trade more? I keep humoring them, maybe one day I'll need to pitch one of my online trading startup ideas to them :P
