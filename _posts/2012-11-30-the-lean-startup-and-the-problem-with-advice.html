title: The Lean Startup and the Problem With Advice
---
I finally plowed my way through?<em >The Lean Startup</em> by Eric Ries. Short judgement: I wish I hadn't, because the book sucks! Ries tries to make analogies of lean manufacturing relevant to startups, but I feel that you'll be better off reading books about lean manufacturing and drawing the analogies yourself. Moreover, I<em > don't</em> get how his methods are analogous to lean manufacturing at all (whatever little I know about lean manufacturing).

The book is a powerful soporific, and there were many times I secretly used it to fall asleep after a frenetic day of coding ( convincing myself of my sincere intentions). It seems to have some kind of a cult following- I have myself seen some entrepreneurs and many?wantrepreneurs swear by this methodology. I have a contrarion opinion, for whatever it's worth.
Essentially, the book is about '<em >build-measure-learn'</em>, or building an MVP, recording how early adopters react to it, and then persevering (continuing on your original plan) or pivoting (changing your plan). With the last sentence, I have summarized the entire book so you won't have to read it.

<strong >No kidding!</strong>

First of all, the book could have easily been cut down in size and I'm talking in the range of 50%. Ries wastes words and paragraphs with abandon, describing and re-describing obvious things. He gives plenty of examples to illustrate his points, but I couldn't understand how they illustrated the said point. Within a few chapters I was involuntarily skipping the examples altogether- it seemed like Ries was trying and failing to fit facts to theory. In the end, it all boils down to what he did in his company, called IMVU. Ries either says he implemented the lean methodology, and therefore everything worked well, or he says he didn't implement it, and therefore problems arose. When you compile all the things that he did and did not do at IMVU, you'll probably begin to doubt if it can even be called a methodology! It's rather a mish-mash of common-sense things to do in startups and ideological points adopted randomly from various sources.

To be fair, nothing he says is <em >wrong</em>. As one entrepreneur ( I know personally) put it, the lean thing is common sense and something that startups do all the time. Also, from what I could make out with my?conversations with many entrepreneurs, the lean thing doesn't have the same proportion of chest-thumping followers in the set of successful entrepreneurs as?it enjoys in the set of greener entrepreneurs and wantrepreneurs. Even as I progressed in my two-bit startup, more and more of the book resonated with me. I didn't need the book to see those things! Those lean problems and their solutions were quite self-evident. The major problems were more basic and at the same time not so obvious to notice.

Worst of all, the book reads like a?compilation of advice. With the poor organization and labored examples and analogies, the book fails to tell a coherent story.??Why's that bad?
<strong >Advice without context is useless! </strong><em >Most </em>advice is useless, since it usually comes devoid of context. Advice is easy. Advice is convenient: it can be wrong but nobody will care!

Being on the receiving end of a lot of advice in the past few months, I would like to give some guidelines (not advice) to people in a position to give advice to others.

Consider Warren Buffet's famous rules for investing:
1. Never lose money
2. Never forget rule number 1

Pretty obvious? Sound advice? Irrefutably true? Absolutely. Everybody knows this.
Yet, intelligent people will rely on rumors and strange technical indicators rather than obvious facts.

Advice makes no sense without a story. Most of us can probably not imagine even something like 'A stitch in time saves nine,' until it actually happens to us. I cannot.

Advice should be as specific as possible.
Situation: I have a problem. I come to you for help. I would very much like to receive help rather than advice.
GOOD: I would use the xyz library or try the uvw forum for the problem you're having.
GOOD: I too had a similar problem proceed to tell the<em > entire</em> story
GOOD: I don't know/ I don't have anything to say that I'm sure could be useful to you. Let's go have a beer (optional).
<strong >BAD</strong>: You need to focus.
<strong >BAD</strong>: This problem you're having is a result of doing/not doing lmn
<em ><strong >BAD</strong></em>: The first rule of abc (startups, web development, whatever) is qwerty (and similar cliched stuff, however true it may be)

Note that the bad advice can be the gospel of truth, but that doesn't stop it from being bad advice. If you still feel that you <em >must?</em>say something along those lines, tell the <em >whole</em> story, or <em >invest</em> yourself ?( if this happened to?<em >me</em>,?<em >I</em>?would do such-and-such), or nothing at all!?The inexperienced (or blinkered) person at the receiving end of your advice cannot see it's value without being primed with a context beforehand! ?Plain advice is a waste of time for both of you.
