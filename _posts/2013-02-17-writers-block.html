Well, not quite: I have been writing beautifully worded reports as part of my internship, but the subject and content of those will probably never be made public. Barring that, I don't have a single coherent thought.

Every morning I go to work on my scooter. More than four out of five times, an ambulance joins me at some point (I've kept a record). I work. I come back and it's a struggle to work on my stuff. <em >Should I catch up with Coursera? Should I work on my projects? Should I work out?</em> My back hurts after my scooter journey if I keep off exercising for too long. I try and split my time between all of them. Then it's the weekend and I'm disappointed that I've made unremarkable progress in my courses and my projects. And <em >no abs.</em> Not that I <em >want</em> abs. I just want more to come out of my workouts. Especially because they come at a cost.

I'm staying with my parents, so I can spend all of my stipend. I don't know how to spend it. I gave a third of it to charity. Some of the rest went in gifts to my family. I spent eight hundred on pizza. I saw <a href="http://www.shop.puma.com/BMW-Nyter-Shoes/pna304320,en_US,pd.html" >these</a> shoes and wanted to buy them, but they're out of stock everywhere. So I didn't spend the rest of my money and have no idea what happened to it.
I wanted to invest it all, of course, in a show of faux self-reliance but decided that a) It's too little to matter and b) it makes a lot more sense to spend it. I've made some terrible decisions in my trading as well. It seemed impossible to find time for this too, so I relied on <em >"instinct"</em> rather than research. Misadventure.

In essence, I had so much free time in college, in addition to a large amount of distinctly unstructured busy-time, that I had no idea what truly being busy (and tired) was. Also, the people. There are more kinds of people than I anticipated.

I'll write more about my internship. I'm working at <a href="http://www.inmobi.com/" >InMobi</a>.?It's been <em >enlightening.</em> I used to wonder how a tech company could be run bu a business guy, but now I have newly-found admiration for the tech founders who handle (or decide not to handle) the business bit of a company. The business bit of a startup (yes, even a startup) is not optional, and MBAs are really a different species. It takes something to<em > manage the managers.</em>
I see the CEO many times: walking past me as I work on my laptop, in the urinal next to mine, or walking generally around me as I too walk to somewhere. He exudes a generic aura of coolness. I try to eavesdrop when he's around me and he invariably says something which sounds cool. I desperately want to interview him and the three co-founders. One of them I meet walking around like the CEO, and once in a very uncomfortable elevator ride. I spent two hours in a room with one guy but he completely ignored me. I've seen the last guy mostly in pictures, where he's mostly drinking or doling out vodka.

As for the PS II part of my internship: we had a group discussion on the<em > commercialization of education</em> last week. Enough said. (Maybe not. I gave my full gyaan to my group about how the problem is the <em >lack</em> of commercialization in education in India, and about free markets and all that, conveniently skipping over finer points like USA's student debt.)

Driving has made me acutely aware of my lack of a girlfriend. It's no problem when you see couples in malls and multiplexes, because that's their natural habitat. It's a problem when you see them on the road, ahead of you, and the guy is slowing down to better hear what the girl on the pillion is saying to him. It pisses me off. I treat them on par with auto drivers ( the scourge of Bangalore), honking incessantly and flipping them off as I overtake them.
I flip a lot of people while I'm driving. I think they're too shocked to respond, because <em >nobody</em> has responded. Granted, most of them are in their cars with the AC on. I had expected something really bad to have happened by now. On Friday I flipped off the <strong >Vice President of India</strong> as he blocked traffic near MG road for over thirty minutes. But I was probably too far behind for him to see.
I've never flipped off a policeman. Not, as you thought, because I'm afraid of them, but because they are the sanest people on Bangalore roads. Also probably the least appreciated.
