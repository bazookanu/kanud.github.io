title: Marketing Part I: Marketing vs Designers
---
'Why don't you make this text yellow?', I was asked, 'the white is looking subdued.'

Yellow? <em >Yellow??</em>I've made the poster using blues and grays. Yellow is in an altogether different part of the spectrum. Why would you want yellow? <em >Why??</em>But this is interesting for another reason. <em >Why yellow??</em>Why not green or red or some other color absurdly outside of my color scheme?

I didn't say any of this, because I'm a lowly intern. In fact, I didn't say anything that remotely expressed my feelings towards yellow, because I was too busy thinking about yellow's?repercussions?on the poster I was designing. By the time I had framed an intelligent response to the question, the meeting had moved on to other things. I poignantly looked at the dozens of layers in the Gimp toolbar, calculating the time it would take to make one layer yellow, and then <em >make the poster not suck.</em>

My natural response to suggestions like these is verbal abuse. I'm no <em >designer,</em> but I follow enough design dudes on twitter to know about glyphs, the fact that some people make a living out of designing fonts, that design is almost a science, and that 3-d pie charts and Comic Sans are to be abhorred. I can recite hex values of color pairs that go well together. I know that dark grey letters look much better than completely black ones, and that Windows 8 tiles have an ever-so-slight gradient.

What I do not know, however, is Marketing. (Marketing doesn't know too much about design either, but that isn't really Marketing's problem.) Here's what Marketing can do:
<ol >
	<li ><span style="line-height:13px;" >Marketing can look at any random piece of information- a document, an email, a poster- and tell you which bits of information will be looked at by a majority of the information's intended audience</span></li>
	<li >Marketing can tell you which fraction of the viewed stuff will be ingested</li>
	<li >It can also project to you a rough trend of the information's metrics- how many clicks, how much recall, and other terms which only Marketing cares to know about.
Marketing even gave me absolute numbers for these things as I stared in disbelief. Disbelief turned to awe as I saw these numbers actually (somewhat) come true.</li>
	<li >Marketing also has a goal in mind about what the piece of information should achieve</li>
</ol>
Looking at my poster with this burden of knowledge, Marketing wanted yellow text in a blue-grey poster. It wasn't an elegant solution, but it did the job. As a designer, it was <em >my</em> job to understand why something needed to be emphasized and figure out how to do it while adhering to design principles- something, incredible as it seems to me, doesn't matter as much as you'd think.

This is invaluable knowledge. It's one thing to read about how much front-end matters, but it's another thing to <em >see</em> how much it matters. It's yet another thing to have your mindset change. It wouldn't have happened if I wasn't an intern, forced to find a way to implement every suggestion.

Marketing didn't limit itself to my posters- it had suggestions for my code as well. And it was right in peculiar ways. Being a good programmer doesn't just mean being a good coder, but rather managing technology, deadlines and people- knowing where to take a stand and where to listen to others.
