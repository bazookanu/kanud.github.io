Here's the BITS Goa part of my map:

I've shaded the people who are breaking away from the core; earlier my BITS Goa network was almost a featureless circle.

The people breaking away are mostly the PS guys- who are apparently getting new, and different, contacts and are becoming less and less part of a?homogeneous?BITS crowd. <em >What is interesting is that they are dragging their friend circles (at least partially) with them.?</em><a href="http://kanudeshpande.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/d3-js-hack-how-does-the-bits-goa-09-network-look/" >And the splotch is curdling.</a>

More information is obviously a way to depict relationships more accurately, but rarely does one come across this specific 'more' information. Is this information buried, and if so can it be found out? If not, what signals does one use across time to create a better map?
