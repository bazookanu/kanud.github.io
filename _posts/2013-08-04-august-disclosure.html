<h2 >Stuff To Help You Decide If You Should Read This Blog</h2>
There was much flux in the last two months. I finally realized the value of college- by virtue of being out of it of course. College was a sandbox of dreams- you could think and there wasn't much that could oppose your thinking.
<h3 >Meanwhile, In The Real World</h3>
I can safely say that my internship was unlike most others. My college decides what internships students get, and from my vantage point, the one I ended up with was based in randomness. I would not have got the internship had I been interviewed for it.

It would suffice to say that for six months, I was on the business and marketing side of things of a hot mobile startup. I had direct contact with the kind of people a guy like me would normally meet a couple of years into his career. And then take a year to actually figure them out. Fitting my pattern, I realized my luck towards the end of the internship. In all fairness, it was a steep learning curve (complicated by me not realizing that there even was one) and I spent a lot of time fretting, trying and failing to make sense of what I and the people around me were doing.

So here I am, an engineer with an above-average understanding of things engineers don't bother about, and maybe have no business bothering about.
<h3 >A Sojourn In A Different Imaginary World</h3>
I'm talking about my trek. It was unexpectedly refreshing, despite the fact that the trek didn't even take place thanks to a once-in-a-century disaster. It was so refreshing because I met interesting people in a relaxed setting. Sure, everybody's a little interesting, but I was struck by the bounded set of people I know. All engineers or related to engineers. Up there, I met people passionate about strange things like walking and chocolates.

Apart from that, I started reading again- for fun; without any pressure to finish it before my next class or assignment. In the last month and a half, I finished reading:
<ul >
	<li >A Storm of Swords (again)</li>
	<li >A Feast For Crows</li>
	<li >A Dance With Dragons</li>
	<li >A Thousand Splendid Suns</li>
	<li >How I Braved Anu Auntu And Co-Founded A Million Dollar Company</li>
	<li >36 Selected Short Stories by Jeffrey Archer</li>
</ul>
I'm halfway through:
<ul >
	<li >Fooled By Randomness</li>
	<li >The Black Swan</li>
</ul>
And I feel awesome.

I've <em >stopped</em> reading newspapers and twitter and started reading facebook. I've found that I can comfortably do all this reading apart from my mandatory reading of textbooks and manuals. I believe I will soon learn to manage time, which should manifest itself as more things owned by me on the internet.
