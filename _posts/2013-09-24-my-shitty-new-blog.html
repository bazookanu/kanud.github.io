<h3 >And What My 2-Bit Blog Taught Me About Life</h3>
This move is about a year in the making. I found some features of Wordpress annoying and then I wanted to learn how to Django.

All our lives we've been taught a bottom-up approach to doing things. In school for instance- everything, from your projects to learning from a textbook, was organized in a rigid, topic-introduction-body-conclusion format. The problem was that by the time you got to the interesting bits (the end of a chapter or the end of your textbook), you were too bored/ jaded/ disillusioned to care any more! This formatting always struck me as odd, especially in science. The scientist who discovered something never did it in an introduction-body-conclusion format. The scientist, more often than not:
Noticed something odd
Tried to figure out why
Discovered something, usually something not planned for initially.

<i >That</i> is the logical way to learn something.

Coming to the point, I spent a year on a bottom-up approach to my new website. I first tried to decide what features I wanted. Naturally, I wanted to change the world, or at least <i >my</i> world. Those features turned out to be too complicated to implement right away. Even after I divided up the thing into sub-projects, they all got suck in a paralysis-by-analysis phase or a too-crude-for-live phase. After a lot of work, I finally scrapped all of it, ending up with this shitty blog built in a few hours, albeit with a grossly unnecessary year-long delay. This blog not only is featureless and shitty-looking, but is also downright grotesque inside. I'm not proud of all that, but I <i >am</i> happy that it's up. That's enough to go on.
<h3 >The Small Losses Eat You Away</h3>
Which of these is better- 25% done each in four tasks or 100% done in one task and nothing in the remaining three?

Both might mean the same thing, but the former definitely feels better. The perceived lack of progress eats at you. It's hard to be creative or confident when you only worry about that.

It gets worse when the unplanned delays start hitting you after you finally get over your planned delays. Like say, your modem breaks down. If you're already burned out, random things like that cause a lot more heartburn than they should.
<h3 >Being Logical Isn't Always Logical</h3>
What would happen if you surgically removed the part of a man's brain responsible for emotion, making him a creature of logic? The results are surprising. Damasio reported in Descarte's Error, that the man uslessly spent his day weighing decisions and accomplishing nothing! It seems that there is after all, an evolutionary reason to emotion. Emotion overrides logic when logic doesn't work.

That's an inaccurate statement; logic, obviously, by definition, isn't <i >wrong</i>. In some choices, there just isn't a clear winner, or it's just to hard to predict it. Waiting to arrive at the correct choice simply obviates the need for it. It isn't necessary to be optimal every time.

If you have any feedback, please comment...Oh wait there's no commenting here. Hrmm. Err..Kthnksbai.
