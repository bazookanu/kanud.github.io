title: What I Think Of The Food Security Bill
---

<p >A bit of background: I've read none of the news or detailed analyses of the bill. That's because I've stopped ready news or detailed analyses of <i >anything</i>. For a month now I've stopped swallowing tweets, stopped reading the newspaper and stopped watching news on TV- I've essentially stopped consuming all information with a short shelf life. It's an experiment to see if it makes me a better trader.
</p><h3 >That Makes Sense Because?</h3><p >The hypothesis is that by not looking at random news that probably does not affect the market, I'll desist from forming incorrect explanations and theories about the market. It seems stupid at first; you have to try it. The most obvious consequence of not doing the things above is the time freed up, which I use to do things of a more long-term value: reading books for instance. Even better, it frees up a lot of my brain-hours. When I observe others, who unlike me clearly spend time thinking of the consequences of the Food Security Bill, I realize that much of their thinking has been in vain. Working with the limited framework of their knowledge (not everyone can expected to be an expert in the effects of such bills), it seems to me that their 'thinking' is actually worrying and/or intellectual masturbation.</p><p >Another surprising thing I discovered is that I'm still updated with the latest general happenings in the world. Mostly its because of others who tell me things, but sometimes it happens by accident. All things considered, it looks to me like reading newspapers <i >is</i> indeed a waste of time, contrary to what your Dad told you. </p><h3 >I Have A View On The Bill, Even Though I Know Little</h3><p >Here's what I know: the government wants to give free or subsidised food to some (claimed) large fraction of India's population (the range I've gathered from people is 65% to 80%). This is bad because the government has no money, so it will somehow take it from the usual suckers, the middle class.</p>Let's forget about the mechanics of how the government will buy the food and distribute it (because I have no idea about how that's going to happen). Assuming the free food is subsistence food, and not Michelin Star material:<ul ><li ><b >Everyone Eats</b>: If everyone eats, everyone buys food already. If the government wants to give it for free, the worst they <del >can</del> will do is add <i >inefficiency</i> to the system- the government will be an unnecessary middleman between the producer and consumer. Considering that there are many middlemen present there already, is it too far-fetched to think that the new big-time middleman might turn out to be a good thing? How massive will the new inefficiency be, and can it get rid of the old ineffciencies?</li><li ><b >Now The Poor Will Eat</b>: Assuming this actually happens, it will mean that the poor can worry about things other than finding their next meal. If they collectively do this, that might mean <i > economic growth.</i></li></ul><p >It still sounds like a pretty bad idea, but not as bad as people think it is, and definitely not for the reasons they think its bad. Giving free food to the poor is not that bad an idea, it can only be as bad as the mechanism of the dole rather than the dole itself.</p>
