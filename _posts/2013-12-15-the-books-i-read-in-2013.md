title: The Books I Read In 2013
---
<p >    It really is the books I read in the <i >latter half</i> of 2013 because college and work made for convenient excuses for not reading. I started off by reading the <i >A Song of Ice And Fire</i> series during my time at Uttarakhand, and holy fucking shit! Reading was a priority again, and I came up with tricks to make the best use of my unstructured free time.</p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83489788/IMAG1180.jpg" width="100%</img" ><h2 >Completed Books (in the order I read them)</h2><ul ><li ><b >The Game Of Thrones Series:</b> I began reading <i >A Game Of Thrones</i> and <i >A Clash Of Kings</i> while in 2012, but not the normal way. George R.R. Martin has written the books as POV chapters of a few dozen characters. I took a depth-first approach to reading these rather than doing it chronologically. So I used to read, say, all of Tyrion Lannister's chapters before things stopped making sense, at which point I would go back to the beginning. I tore through <i >A Storm Of Swords</i>, <i >A Feast For Crows</i> and <i >A Dance With Dragons</i> in record time and wallowed about with withdrawal effects for the next two weeks</li><li ><b >A Thousand Splendid Suns:</b> Most people prefer Hosseini's <i >The Kite Runner</i> to this, and it indeed seems like a movie sequel. What I enjoyed most about this book was that it was written from a woman's perspective, but I "got" it. It's hard to empathize with something you can't relate to, but Hosseini somehow made me. I would have attributed my "getting it" it to my own, increased maturity, but who would I be fooling?</li><li ><b >The Bachelor Of Arts</b> and <b >The English Teacher</b>: If you're a south Indian, no writer can depress you as ruthlessly, and as beautifully as R.K. Narayan. <i >The Bachelor Of Arts</i> I feel, assumes a lot of familiarity of small-town, middle-class, old-age south India, but of course I enjoyed it. <i >The English Teacher</i> is widely regarded as Narayan's watershed novel; his work after this was darker and less innocent than before. <i >The English Teacher</i> is sad in more than one way. There's the part up to the death of his wife, which is visceral, and then there's the desperate part after the death of his wife. I don't think Narayan let himself go in any of his works the way he has done in the latter part of this novel.</li><li ><b >Fooled By Randomness</b> and <b >The Black Swan</b>: Killer books. I was simultaneously reading his more incomprehensible papers with these books. It was an explosive orgy of philosophy, mathematics and common sense. Nassim Taleb is the kind of person I would love talking to. Sometimes the philosophy got too tedious, sometimes it felt like a chapter was written while Taleb was on crack, and sometimes I wholeheartedly disagreed with what was written. All of which are reasons for me to recommend these books. You can probably skip <i >Antifragile</i>, as I have done, and go ahead and tackle his textbook on <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/FatTails.html" >Fat Tails</a> instead.</li><li ><b >Fault Lines:</b> Raghuram Rajan is a genius. This is a book where every sentence is insightful. So much so, that I looked twice for some deeper meaning in what I read if I didn't find any at first glance.  Every chapter is well-researched. The more I read this, the happier I was that Rajan was heading the RBI. Nassim Taleb wrote about the financial crisis tinted with his wacky, esoteric philosophy, while Micheal Lewis wrote about it as the conscientious banker. Rajan has written about it from <i >everybody's</i> perspective, and he's given each perspective it's exact due weightage! <i >Fault Lines</i>, <i >The Big Short</i> and <i >The Black Swan</i> are the trifecta you <i >must</i> read to truly understand what happened in the 2008 financial crisis.</li><li >    <b >The Motorcycle Diaries:</b> This one is a must-read for my 20-something friends who already feel like bitter uncles after a few months of corporate life (all of them).</li><li >    <b >The Art Of War:</b> I adore these timeless books whose value endures centuries of change. I don't know if mine is some abridged version, but it was really short.</li><li >    <b >False Impressions:</b> Classic Jeffrey Archer. It's responsible for making me sound intelligent about art.</li><li >    <b >Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish</b> and <b >Dhandha:</b> Both books bought to get my order above Rs. 500 for free delivery from Flipkart. The former is lackluster at best and the latter reads like it was sponsored by Narendra Modi. Not to say that the people being written about are not inspiring, just that the writers did a half-assed effort.</li><li >    <b >The Intelligent Investor:</b> This one's so bloody brilliant, that it needs a <a href="/blog/why-i-invest" >whole post to itself.</a></li></ul><h2 >Semi-Completed Books</h2><ul >    <li >        <b >Algorithms:</b> I read each algorithm like a bedtime story.    </li>    <li >        <b >Sita:</b> To all those who like Amish Tripathi, Devdutt Pattanaik (the author of this book) is the guy from whom he ripped of his noveau-Shiva+Parvati idea. And did a poor job of it as well. Pattanaik seems to have given more attention to detail in <i >Sita</i> than his previous works, but I wish there was some more rigor to his thoughts. Not that I'm disappointed in any way with what I've read.    </li>    <li >        <b >I Too Had A Dream:</b> A candid account of the humble Verghese Kurien. Enjoyed the few chapters I've read.    </li>    <li >        <b >One Click:</b> Way smaller than the usual techpreneur biography but packs the same punch.    </li>    <li >        <b >Ashenden:</b> This is purely pleasure reading, so it went down the priority list. But I've always enjoyed Maugham, so I'll probably finish it before 2014.    </li>    <li >        <b >Great Expectations:</b> I absolutely cannot find the patience to read this. Every paragraph seemed delightful, until I mentally summarized it into one line. It's a poor way to look at literature but I don't think I'll finish this anytime soon.    </li>    <li >        <b >These:</b>        <br >        <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83489788/IMAG1182.jpg" width="50%</img" >        <br >        They resulted in three certifications. I'm now a CCNP'ed Advanced Derivative Strategist (given by ICICI).        </li>        </ul>        <br >        My goal was to read one book a week. I'm a bit short right now, but I'm excluding things like manuals and papers. I also tried reading some books I'd rather not reveal.        <hr >        1. After I wrote about my Uttarakhand trip, a lot of people told me I should seriously consider writing. I don't think of myself as a great writer, but I decided to test that theory. After some thought, I decided that a good writer should be able to write a love story, so that became my yardstick to see if I'm a good writer.        <br >        I failed miserably. I couldn't honestly write about it, so I thought I'll study stories, find patterns and fake it. It turned out to be not so easy to fake, or maybe I only felt that way because I knew of my dishonesty.        <br >        2. I still dread reading the ending of <i >Swami And Friends</i>. Even thinking about it is terribly foreboding. What kind of magical genius is this, for someone to bring back your most deeply buried childhood memories, that are so incongruous and incomprehensible to you as an adult, with just words? Pink Floyd does the same thing, but they at least have music!        <br >        3. Disagreeing with what is written is a patently un-Indian thing to do. Maybe this is why our ancestors didn't write anything down. Or from another perspective, maybe this is why our culture took a dive when we were forced to quantify and write down things.        <br >        4. Cisco Certified Network Professional
