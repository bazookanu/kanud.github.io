title: A Guide To The Runner's High
---
<p >    This is not a post extolling the health, or environmental, benefits of running. Rather, this is a tutorial on how to get high when you're too poor or uncool to get yourself more mainstream drugs, too ugly or shy to get yourself a romantic partner, too ulcerous to drink alcohol, too cancerous to smoke cigarettes, or too well-adjusted and level-headed to do any of the preceding. If you've never run before, or you do run but have never experienced the high, I urge you to read this. These are the notes of a novice</p><p >    First of all, <i >the high is real</i>. It is <i >really a high.</i> <br > True, it does not have the social and health risks associated with normal drugs. This is why most people are skeptical about it being real. Moreover, it is elusive. It does not always happen, and might well be stochastic. This non-linear behavior also explains why most people don't believe in it, because it takes a semi-intelligent mind to appreciate non-linearity and probability.</p><h3 >The Theory- How Is It Even Possible?</h3><p >    When you run, or do any strenous activity, your brain can sometimes be fooled to think that the body has sustained a grevious injury. To help itself deal with the pain, it releases <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins" >endorphins</a>. These are proteins that make you happy. They are also released when eat spicy food (<i >not too much, though, explaining that crazy lady who rubs chillies in her eyes</i>), lose a lot of blood (<i >some mad stuff done by wounded soldiers is attributed to this</i>), or are in love (<i >endorphin overload, this is what spawned the diamond industry and Fifty Shades of Grey</i>). Yeahhh...<i >now</i> you know what I'm talking about.    </p><p >    If looked at from a metaphorical perspective, and I can feel the collective of groans coming, you are running away from your problems... No? OK I'll stop.</p><h3 >My Story</h3><p >    I started running in college, because I noticed one day that I ran like a little girl with a heart condition. For the first few runs, instead of a high, I got back pains. It felt like my spinal cord got compressed to a straight iron rod jutting awkwardly into my neck. For the next few runs, I got monster calves. They seriously expanded. As did the whole of my lower body. If I didn't have a poor body image already, I would have given up at this point. There was absolutely no redemption in it- you <i >don't</i> transform into a muscular hunk, you give up easily and often, and you get no pleasure at the beginning, middle or end.</p><p >    Then comes the point when you get accustomed to the idea of running. You don't feel like giving up thirty seconds after starting. When you do give up, you have enough motivation to do another stretch after resting a bit. You become comfortable running at any time of the day. At this point, the highs begin.</p><p > They are rather shy, like a bride in an 80s Bollywood movie. Instead of comtemplating drowning yourself, you feel philosophical and poetic in the shower. After your shower, you feel like socializing with strangers over dinner rather than collapsing on the bed. Later, you might feel like going outside and having an ice-cream in lieu of liking a five year old picture of your crush on facebook.</p><p >    As you get better, the intensity increases because you get comfortable with pushing yourself more. <b >Don't plateau out!</b> Run a little more, or a little faster each day. Get yourself good music and a good pair of running shoes. A lot of people (including me) get bored at some point. Running is a meditative act, so get yourself some stress if you get bored. Finally, go run in a competitive event.</p><h3 >The Marathons (or the 5Ks and the 10Ks)</h3><p >    Don't worry, odds are there will be fatter and unhealthier runners than you in any event. To be absolutely safe, pick a popular event to begin with, which have a substantial number who come just to take selfies and upload it on Snapchat or whatever. They drop out in the middle, so you'll be better than them by just strolling, crawling, or if you're spherically fat, rolling to the finish line. People standing on the sides cheer you (maybe not <i >you</i>, but you can always pretend). They have stalls at a couple of points where guys beg you to take bottles of water or Gatorade (I believe the TCS run even has peeled oranges):    <br >    <img src="http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/photo/2011-10/65301711.jpg" width="50%" alt="They actually hire people for this" >    <br >    Seriously. It's ridiculous.    <br >    Your fellow runners sometimes pat you on the back and try to motivate you. At which point you shriek your thanks and run to the finish while a <i >Rocky</i> or <i >Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</i> montage plays in your head.</p><p > Basically, it is a setting to fool you into believing that there is something more profound going on than a lot of people with deep-seated personal problems hauling ass. Which makes for a good high.</p><h3 >What Works For Me</h3><p >    As I've stated before, it does not always work. But work it does. All the following hypotheses have only anecdotal evidence and a couple of data points, but I feel they make sense.</p><ul >    <li >        Take a shower after you run. I have a feeling that a swim will work even better. Don't wallow about in a tub, it doesn't work.    </li>    <li >        Drink something sweet and fruity when you finish.    </li>    <li >        Eat a lot- not immediately but as soon as possible. Eating your favorite food is even better.    </li> <li >       Listen to 'happy' songs while you're eating.    </li>   <li >        Get yourself shoes specifically designed for running. Not that flat-soled or sole-hugging crap. Get shoes designed for speed.    </li>    <li >        Run at odd times (but take care not to do it too soon after a meal).    </li>    <li >        Run in novel situations. I once ran on a hill in Tehri, in heavy trekking shoes and boxers, very early in the morning. Then I plucked sour apples off a tree and read Game Of Thrones. I have, and had, never been as pleased with myself as then.    </li>    <li >        Set an ambitious goal and reach it. This is an iffy.    </li>    <li >        Run a lot one day, and do it again the next day.    </li>    <li >        Run in an event.    </li></ul><hr >1. What better post to start the new year with?<br >2. Well, not exactly. You will overdo it, which will lead to aches and sprains that stay with you weeks after they began. And sometimes, your mood subsequent to a run will be incongruosly upbeat with the situation, which might tick people off.<br >3. Both options are bad- liking a picture of your crush at five years of age, or liking a picture taken five years ago. If both options are the same or similar, you shouldn't be on facebook.<br >4. The Gatorade or Red Bull depends on how much you pay for your pass.
