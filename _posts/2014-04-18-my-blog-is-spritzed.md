<p ><a href="http://www.spritzinc.com/the-science/" >Spritz</a> is the most exciting thing to happen to my life since I decided to <a href="/blog/the-books-i-read-in-2013" >read a book every week</a>. For those of you who pity me for the last sentence, please go read <i >Quiet: The Power of Introverts Who Can't Stop Talking</i>. Introvert-chic is the new feminism, and yes I really enjoy reading.</p><p >Back to Spritz. With Spritz, I now read ebooks at 500 words a minute. <i >500 mothafucking words in a mothafucking minute.</i> I can't wait for Spritz to make its way to my favorite ebook readers. Meanwhile, my API access will do.</p><p >I'm so excited I even made a horrible meme:<br ><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JnN9z0A.jpg" width="100%</img" ><p >I will be making an app or two, but I'm hard-pressed for time right now.
