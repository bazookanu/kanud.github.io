title: Obligatory Blog After Quitting My Job
---
<br ><br >This is going to be one long and self-indulgent post. It encapsulates what I've learned in the fourth largest, non-trivial, contiguous activity of my life- after sleep, school and college. While these are things that matter to nobody, I honestly believe in an iota of wisdom buried somewhere in what I want to write. It's probably in the part about happiness.<br ><h3 >The Planning Process</h3>I chose my last job over a potentially kick-ass role in a definitely kick-ass company. Now, nineteen months later, there seem to be reasons both for and against my decision. I had assured myself then, that I was aware of all these reasons. Actually, I had done something really dangerous: a lazy analysis that was nowhere near rigorous, but nevertheless enough to convince others of my decision.<br ><br >My job turned out to be wildly different from my expectations. In fact, I hadn't the slightest inkling that jobs like mine <i >existed</i>. Six months on, I was still struggling to understand what I was doing, and where it fit with what I wanted to do in life. This led to the discovery that my idea of what I wanted to do in life was not in harmony with reality.<br ><br >I had to trace the problem back to its roots in my wrong assumptions. Unfortunately, time did not stop while I did this. I ended up wasting a lot of time understanding what had happened and why, let alone what to do next. In other words, I had no plan.<br ><br >Andy Grove has this to say about the planning process:<br ><br ><i >'...the true output of the planning process is the set of tasks it causes to be implemented. The output of Intel's annual plan, for instance, is the actions taken and changes prompted as a result of the thinking process that took place throughout the organization. I, for one, hardly ever look at the bound volume called the Annual Plan. In other words, the output of the planning process is the decisions made and the actions taken as a result of the process.'</i><br ><br >I still think it was impossible to predict which job was actually better, or at least irrelevant. While I had thought this obviated the need to do find out more about my options, it had become imperative that I gather more data and think some more. Going into uncertain situations with no plan only increases your reaction time. It does not matter if it's the worst plan in the world, but you need to go through the rigors of making a plan- especially listing out all the assumptions that will be validated or discarded.<br ><h3 >The 10% Project</h3>The in thing when I joined Cisco was a new technology paradigm called software-defined networking. I became enamored with it. At an all-hands meeting, I gave my 2-bit gyaan about it to the boss of my superboss. He appeared impressed and asked me to schedule an appointment and present the leftover gyaan to him. Obviously, I had no more gyaan than what could span a five-minute conversation, so I couldn't present any more. Instead, I decided to come up with a patentable idea. <br ><br >This was ridiculous, because my team had nothing to do with software-defined networking, and the technology itself was bleeding-edge. I didn't tell anyone then that I wanted a patent, which was wise, because nobody thought it was possible even after I submitted my application for review. They were almost right- it was only remotely possible.<br ><br >The idea was not something earth-shattering. Toward the end, it became an exercise in understanding tiny details- an incredibly tedious process that required hours of wasted effort. Resolving a single tiny detail felt like a huge victory; an ephemeral celebration because you had found two more problems in the process of solving one. Paradoxically, if you look at the final draft, you might think it's plain obvious, something that might have taken an afternoon to write. <br ><br >The only unique thing about the whole affair was that it had a 10% chance of success throughout. Had you asked a networking expert what my chances of success were before I started, she might have said 10%. Later, I became an expert in the subtle optimization of an optimization that was my project, and I thought that the odds of my application being accepted were 10%. It was 10% no matter what I did, and I ended up doing rather a lot. Still, there was a 90% chance that nobody would know, and a 99% chance that nobody would care. <br ><br >It was, however, the best way to learn. <br >If it wasn't intellectually difficult, why was it a 10% project? It was a 10% project because: <ul ><li >I knew literally nothing about the technology before I started working on it. The idea had nothing to do with my job. </li><li >I had a kinda-sorta idea, but the problem was not properly defined. Therefore, the plan changed every time I learned something new about the technology or the business problem. This sometimes happened on an hourly basis.</li><li >I had no mentor for a long time. In hindsight, not prioritizing reaching out to mentors was a huge mistake. I got stuck in my own head while conceptualizing things, and missed seeing obvious problems.</li><li >External delays and friction (getting lab access to test the prototype, waiting on the company patent committee while they got to reviewing the application) took up a huge chunk of the whole effort.</li></ul> <br >The whole thing was analogous to a dumb robot solving a maze: reaching dead ends and retracing the long path back. Except, sometimes it took a committee to tell me if where I was was a dead end. <br ><br >The effort was in keeping at it. It would have been very easy to write a technical paper and give up on fixing an actual business problem. Every time I decided not to do that, I had to pivot the idea to overcome whatever objections our mentors or the patent committee had. They helped us with that pivot, I think, thrice. <br ><br >Expectedly, the application was declined- despite it being ‘interesting and possibly of business value', it was not ‘especially novel'. Reading that was not gut-wrenching. I had accepted long back that the odds were really around 10%. <br ><br >If you are the only person in the world solving a 10% problem, it makes sense to do it. Another trivial case where it makes sense is when you have run out of other options. Otherwise, 10% projects are essentially a lot of opportunity cost for an uncertain reward. On the flipside, it is also true that most projects that are worth doing are 10% projects. The way out, I suppose, is to get to a place where the cost of failure is not fatal. <br ><h3 >Happiness and Stability (Localized Happiness)</h3>With my project, courses and my goal of reading a book every week, I ended up working late nights a lot, sometimes on weekends too. When this came up in conversations, my polite friends asked me if I was happy doing this. The impolite ones said I will never be happy as I will always be chasing some unachievable goal. This rankled me- how were these people measuring happiness so confidently? The implication always seemed to be that they were happier than me. If I went out four more times each month, had one more foreign holiday and got one more girlfriend, I too could be as happy as everyone else. This sounds great, and obvious, and irrefutable. However, I never saw any correlation between degree of conformance one has to this model, and happiness. <br ><br >The glaring mistake, in my opinion, is that people think happiness can be defined with a lone factor- happiness itself, described by some simple formula like:<br >Happiness = Pleasure - Pain<br >This is meaningless. If a person uses this equation and says he is happy or sad, it is an arbitrary decision on his part to assign pleasure a higher weight than pain  or vice-versa. For instance, if the person has:<br >A. a great girlfriend and<br >B. a terrible manager,<br >it is arbitrary to decide that the girlfriend matters more than the manager or vice-versa. This oversimplification leads to a local stability- a temporary happiness- that is not assured to last. A great girlfriend and a bad manager can both significantly affect your life. Ignoring one of them to suit your <i >choice</i> of being happy or sad, by Murphy's Law, will lead to a problem: be it a hiccup or a showdown. Given the ways these things usually pan out- getting fired in a company-wide layoff (showdown), or your girlfriend accusing you of aloofness (hiccup)- it is easy to blame environmental factors for something that was your fault. <br ><br >I use 'stability' not to describe a lack of change (not breaking up with your boyfriend) but rather the tendency to be unaffected by undesirable events (not being depressed on breaking up with your desirable boyfriend). People seem to jump from one local happiness to another, staying stable for hours, months and years. The outcome of one period of stability decides the starting conditions of the next. What's the harm in that? I think it gradually, but surely, cuts down on your options. Your ability to choose your state of happiness or sadness greatly diminishes- the world makes that decision for you. <br ><br >With all of the above in mind, I decided to define happiness. And I did:<br ><br ><i >With the vertical axis representing progress on the Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the horizontal axis representing progress from short-term to long-term goals, and a point on the graph representing an achievement, happiness is proportional to: (i) the modulus of a vector summation of achievements represented in this manner and (ii) the expected positive change of this sum.</i><br ><br ><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83489788/happyequation.png" width="100%" >Further extending the example above, I think the ideal way to go from being a loser whose sole possession is a raisin to a successful owner of a candid wedding photography studio would be to achieve things such that you are always close to the line joining these two points (raisin owner and photography studio owner) on the graph. This is obviously impractical, so unless you stray too far from the line it makes sense to be short-term greedy collecting your points. What units you choose are, needless to say, on you.<br ><br >If you're thinking that the definition is a neat statement that might be completely useless, I share your opinion. Still, rigor can't hurt. <br ><hr ><br >[1] - It was either this blog or a story about how I fell in and out of love with this girl, read <i >Memories of my Melancholy Whores</i>, connected the two and got my mind blown. The lame bit is I imagined the girl out of a billboard ad I saw on my ride home from work. I could write it up nicely because an imaginary girlfriend is not as pathetic as it sounds. To illustrate- your ex may be real but the girl who transformed into her was probably imaginary.<br >[2] - In his book, <i >High Output Management</i>, which everyone should read. Twice.<br >[3] - This is assuming that your motivation to preserve (or change) your current situation stems from your judgement of how happy (or unhappy) you are.<br >[4] - Yes, I shifted genders for equality and stuff.<br >[5] - 'Bro, your example is bull****. The VP of my company got fired today': it's an example, work with me.
