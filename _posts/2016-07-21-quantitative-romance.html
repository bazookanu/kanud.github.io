<p>Yesterday, I had the good fortune of encountering a person who had not only read <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, and not only had a well-formed opinion about it, but also summarily dismissed my own opinion without a second thought. Obviously, I am now commemorating the discovery of my new best friend by arguing how wrong she is.</p>

<p>The novel is complex, but here’s the gist (if my memory serves right):
<ul>
<li>Loverboy and girl fall in love as teenagers</li>
<li>Girl goes away because her father is against the match, and they become pen-lovers</li>
<li>Girl comes back for some reason</li>
<li>Girl meets Loverboy and decides she is now too cool for him. Yes, yes, it’s described with a lot more emotional depth about how they’ve grown apart and their love was never meant to be. </li>
<li>Girl marries Doctorman, who’s logical unlike our romantic Loverboy.</li>
<li>Girl and Doctorman go through married life, shit happens, but in the end the mostly love each other</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Loverboy decides to wait for Doctorman to die and vows to remain faithful to Girl.</li>
<li>Loverboy still has <i>needs</i>, however. He prowls the streets in a carriage, and learns to read girls cold (down to an art form), whether they’re DTF</li>
<li>He proceeds to F a series of (let’s say <i>n</i>) girls, while being emotionally unavailable. This mostly does not bode well for those <i>n</i> girls, especially a school going girl<sup>1</sup> in the end who commits suicide. A lot of these <i>n</i> girls have fallen in love with Loverboy (let’s say a fraction <i>f</i> of them).</li>
<li>Doctorman dies, and Loverboy, now an old man, immediately proposes to Girl (also old). Did I already mention the school girl kills herself for being jilted by Grandpa Loverboy?</li>
<li>Girl ultimately says yes</li>
<li>They go on a cruise together, pretending the ship has cholera-infected passengers so they may have privacy. Forever.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Yes, the novel is embellished with rich descriptions of emotional conflict around the summary above, and yes, it’s very good, not at all as straightforward as my summary. A recurring theme is how love <i>can be</i> a disease. The last bit, where they pretend they have cholera so nobody will disturb their cruise, is symbolic of that. It was quite clear to me that Marquez’s message was Loverboy erred badly, ruining the lives of others, while getting no happiness himself except seeing his stubbornness fulfilled. My friend disagreed, going with the love-triumphs-all hypothesis- Loverboy and Girl ultimately are truly in love, and the fact that they’re a thousand years old when that happens only proves the trueness of their love.</i>

<p>I realize my blasé analysis of the novel does nothing to strengthen my cause, but that was a lost battle from the start. A plain argument is useless too, in the face of people’s idea of true love- Loverboy ruined some <i>fn</i> lives, caused a suicide or two, remained unhappy for most of his life and gained the little time with his beloved, before one of them died of a heart attack or old age.</p>

<p>I will instead use an analogy, in the form of the story of Kuber’s treasure. Kuber is the Hindu god of wealth, and four men set out to find his treasure on a mountain. Some way up the mountain, they find copper. One man is pleased and proposes they fill their sacks with copper and return home. The rest decide that there would be more valuable treasure higher up. The first man fills up his sack with copper and returns home, becoming a successful merchant later on. Meanwhile, the three men climb halfway up the mountain and find silver. One of them is content to fill up his sack and return home. Finally, the remaining two men climb even higher, and face much hardship. Almost at the peak, they find gold. Ecstatic, one of them proclaims their goal fulfilled. The other man is still greedy. He bids goodbye to his friend and decides to keep climbing</p>

<p>After many days of no luck, he finds a man with a spinning wheel burrowing into his bleeding head. Bewildered, he asks the man about who he is, and whether he too is searching for Kuber’s treasure. As soon as the words leave his mouth, the wheel lifts off the bleeding man’s head and lands on our hero</p>

<p>The bleeding man explains that yes, he too was searching for Kuber’s treasure thousands of years ago. He too, was not content with gold. Disgusted by his greed, Kuber cursed the man that a heavy wheel would spin on his head to teach him a lesson, and the curse would be lifted only when another horribly greedy man takes his place.</p>

<p>The analogy with Marquez’s story is this: replace the precious metals with girls. The genius of Marquez is that he does not finish the story. He does not write about the wheel lifting off the cursed man’s head and landing on our hero. His deviousness is that he does not write that our hero will never make it down the mountain<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<li>This is not intended to be sexist. Loverboy simply happens to be a male protagonist. The analogy would be valid with reversed genders as well.</li>
