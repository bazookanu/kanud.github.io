<h1 class="page-title">A VENKATESHWAR REDDY</h1><p>venky, the first thing i get in my mind about is u leaning on the door, checking ur hair and getting pleased about ur beauty and ur lungi :P . u r a cool, calm, patient leader with a bit of hardcore tastes. u always wanted to do something new and was never afraid about anything. u took our group (atleast some of us :P) in a new direction. u r a good and trustworthy friend. i hope u will enter politics and show ur power. i wish u have some great times ahead. keep rocking \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krishna-murthy-b">Krishna Murthy B</a></p>
<p>A tale of a Reddy ( Angry young man ) from KADAPA!! 
It’s been a long journey in Bits with you. Reddy is a classic person. Me and reddy differ in just about anything we talk about but he always finds a way to involve me and makes it interesting. He is a unique person and always stays true to his heart. A hard worker at Acads (damn you :x). Knows a lot (really a lot) about politics and a true fan of YSR and Jagan.
He keeps on chatting for hours and is my first hand to know anything that’s happening on campus. Trust me , you will, for sure be shocked to look at him speaking all those diversified stuff. You name any Indian celebrity( be it politics, Films, Mafia :D ) and he knows their history. A great fan of RGV . And a true lover!!
 Its been a long long journey and thanks(:P) for every time u were with me . I can never ever forget all our adventures be it going to bogmalo with 40 bucks in hand or going to Vasco continuously for seven days and all those philosophies we talked about (or framed?!).
Man, you taught me a lot!! 
Intelligent, Honest, Trustworthy. That’s venky for me. 
I know we will be in touch and thus I don’t need to go all psenti :P.All the best :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-gupta-akirala">Tarun Gupta Akirala</a></p>

<p>First  thing u notice about venky is less talkative (that is first time eventually it will change :P )  .we individually busy with  ruining of  our first semester   successfully (:P ) so we didn’t get a chance exactly to get friends  .after first semester our cg’s are  almost same so i thought he is also studies like me but in the second when i studied combined studies with him i came to know that nobody studies like venky . he has unique way of doing that he never gives damn in courses which he don’t like he simply left them but if he likes the subject  then thats it don’t expect anybody better than him .he is soo good at understanding the concepts _/\_. 
 
About venky ,  he knows everything about politics, he can  give lectures about politics for hours in all perspectives . he is  very big fan of 4 ppl YSR ,YS jangan ,Ramgopal Varma and suri .he can write biography for them he knows that much about them. he  is good at sports especially in cricket and poker also ( :P ) .We used to go to gym regularly . a true lover :D (1950’ model as we discussed :P ).1 more thing u can observe is he is very brave ,he never afraid of any situation (may be because blood of kadapa :P ). He got his own idea about his life . ( very rare and unique :)? ) 
Between and venky , i had a great time with venky ,he taught us so many things (u know wat i mean :P) ,we used to chat hours and hours in his room about politics (even though i don’t know anething :P) ,about cricket, movies ,campus gossips (believe me everything in campus  related to relations he knows  that and he used to enlighten us :P ),future plans and soo on they are never ending ....we used to roam around the campus alot whenever either one is got bored, going to mongi and comeback to hostel by longest path possible  those all memories are unforgettable . yeah  intresting points come here bogmalo and nightouts in campus for another things ( :P ) after that talking about the things between all of 5 ppl  .the course we did under BDM without bunking even a single class, u helped me in that very much u used to do work for me also (thanx :D ) .ur the one always ready when i say “will go sumwhere “ and u always gives the chance to other people decide and u  just says that “i will come wherever u want to go “ :D .  
U can keep on write but at some point we need to stop soo i will stop . all the best for  ur future :D
