<p>Guru ji' as we all call him, he is truly a guru. You will never find him distressed about petty things in life. He likes to move on, and enjoys life to its fullest. All the trips are incomplete without him. He is an excellent singer, though many people may not be knowing this fact. Its a real fun to have him around you, and when he is in full 'guru mode', his jokes alone are enough to bring liveliness. Intelligent and practical, I am sure he will be successful in whatever profession he chooses. I wish him all the very best for his future endeavors.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>

<p>Aakash aka Guru.. you are an incredible person I met. If anybody asks me later about my best friends in BITS, your name will surely be mentioned. Since we first met, you have been a great friend. The mess times, the evening walks, the trips we had and the journeys from home to campus and back are all cherishable moments. when it comes to journey, I can't help mentioning about our first journey during jaundice break via Mumbai which was an adventure. Also me and Vibhor were taunting you for scoring 70/75 in thermo all the way during that journey.We share same taste in movies. He is good in academics. He is a diehard for CS and a pro cs player. He has a good sense of humor. He is very helpful and down to earth guy. Thanks for being such a friend all these years. Wish you good luck for future and you will surely reach pinnacles in your field.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
