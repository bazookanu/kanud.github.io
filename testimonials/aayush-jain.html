<h1 class="page-title">Aayush jain</h1><p>A strange and scary instance of securing "extradordinarily high" marks  brought us together in 1-1 ....and I think we have been best of friends ever since albeit a few minor hiccups .Be it going to baga and calangute in 1-2 or just killing time in our rooms ...the memories of the time we spent together or rather enjoyed together will always stay back as something which will make me happy in the years to come ....!!!Keep up your good work in the field of "gathering and dissemination of vital information about the right people and at the right time".Also do consider my "unethical business proposals " seriously sometime ...you never know when you might need them in life ....:P!!!!All the best for your life ahead .....I will pray that the "opportunity rich" streak continues in your life and you actually realize all your romantic fantasies in real life .....:-)!!!!

<p>Chote, as I call him has been a great frnd since the very beginning of my life at BITS, and since then our innumerable number of  days together on campus has made us best of buddies. From the SAC late night sessions just before spree to ,no matter what the occasion is we will kill time, sessions at either of our rooms, to me beating him badly in carom (i guess he plays), to the INVALUABLE talks, to his counter part "mote", he has been an epic friend. Always helped me in my hard times to the best of what he could, and believed in me. Thanks for being their @  BLACKSLAM.. ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranay-agrawal">Pranay Agrawal</a></p>
<p>The talented sportsperson of the hostel. Someone whom you will straightaway start respecting because of the way he carries himself, the polite and kind way he talks to you and is ever ready to listen and hear you out. Always a smile on his face and knows how to lighten up the mood by his funny stories about other people (you know whom i am referring to ;) ). Even i won't forget that long long walk with u that day mate. It was just a pleasure knowing you and i just wish you all the best for you future. Have a great time ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Aayush... cutie pie of IS 2009 batch... amazing handwriting (excels even girls in that :P)...  An awesome person at heart... Billion dollars smile.... met him in 1-2 during our workshop.... I was just amazed by this person that how can a person be so cool and calm and the way he works, if he likes it ( :P), is simply inspiring. Our assignments for EEEp, freshers, abhigyaan meetings, we really had an awesome time. Brilliant in electronics Aayush is one of those who can do anything for his friends, very honest. Even his Co-curricular speaks of his dedication, be it an awesome Carom or Cricket, he bestows it all... Really Abhigyaan reached a new level under his coordination... i will miss all the fun we had, meri lagaana (rem that Bhojpuri incident.. and mess wala kand)... wish we were together for some more time.. Be in touch...and take care :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>

<p>Heard of "Silence kills"? Its so apt for him. This guy doesnt believe in speaking much but knows everything happening around him ;) He is one guy who is very mature and sensible. He can actually guess what you think and that is really unbelievable :O:P He is the biggest gambler i have ever met :D all his claims always turns out to be true as far as i know :P He looks veryyyy shareeef but you should know aayush, after 3 yrs, we all know the truth :P;) He is a multi-talented guy with his great contribution towards Abhigyaan, godlike Carrom player and is always behind the  queen(really hope you find ur queen some day ;):D) etc etc. He is always there to help and is a great frnd to have. We spent a lot of time together be it the JUNGLE trip :P, carnival, palolim and many more. It was always fun to hang out with you. I wish you all the very best in life and hope to remain great frnds in future as well. Have a great life ahead!!:D:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>The simplest, calm yet friendly, humorous, down to earth person I’ve seen. He always has tat everlasting smile on his face. Never let it go :) 
He is a pro carom player and was truly dedicated to the spree work (well u could hav seen them in his sm :D)
Aayush has been an active member of abhigyaan since 1st year and is coordinator for abhigyaan in 3rd year…I still remember his dedication to Abhigyaan, which I came to know thru a small discussion in 3-1….inspite of having the difficult CDCs and DSTN as elective he still managed everything so well in abhigyaan. Hats off to your social responsibility!!Keep up the good work :) 
Aayush migles very easily wid everyone, he’s friend of everyone in our branch…he’s one guy I respect the most in IS.
All the best for the bright future ahead!!Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srinivasa-lahiri">Srinivasa Lahiri</a></p>
