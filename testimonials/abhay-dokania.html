<h1 class="page-title">Abhay Dokania</h1><p>You can tell, from his peaceful personality what kind of guy he is. Very composed, cool, kind, helpful, a very good writer & orator, these are few of his many qualities to add to his charm. I got to know more of him, when we shared "EPS" classes during 2-1. Inspite being a "phodu" and among the top students of his batch, hes very down to earth which is very rare and one of his best quality. I am sure he will do many great things in his life and wish him all the very best for the road ahead. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>Abhay Dokania is a great friend. He is a person with great composure and calmness always visible on his face and in his actions. He is a great debater and knows how to convey a message in beautiful words with convenience and gentle gestures. There exist people who keep on blabbering in hi-fi English, using the F word after each and other word, just to prove their point. He is not in that league at all! He is a complete gentleman who will behave in a civilized manner and convey his message. I wish him a great and successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Abhay Dokania is a weird little fellow . Never had had a niteout in his college life . Ever . Has an impeccable schedule . Never misses any class.Never misses any breakfast . Has an unusual sense of humour that none of us quite get . Pretty much the authority on anything even remotely associated with the keywords "manga" or "anime" . Can always be found reading weird fantasy books on his sad little mobile screen . Enough praises sung , eh ? :P 

Seriously speaking, Abhay "The_Coon" Dokania has to be  the most effortless 9p on campus . Always trying out new TV series or movies and still putting us all to shame. A true gamer , tries out every little game he can find ( although our DOTA adventure didnt quie work out . Anyways , I was better 0.0 ). A fellow Queen fan , has quite a good taste music wise , sadly cant say the same thing about movies . 

Study wise , this sad little boy-man is quite a phenomenon. Achieves anything he set his mind to . Right now he is quite focussed on getting admission to these Ivy League colleges .  Seriously , God save the Yanks . 

Chal Abhay, jaldi design a out of this world Chemical Plant we can all be proud of. (I'm just saying, how will we n00bs know its out of the world ...still u got to make the world happy :P)
Good luck :)    <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/japneesh-singh">Japneesh Singh</a></p>

<p>Abhay aka Bhallu is my neighbour. On my first meet, he looked calm, composed. Further, hes a good spokesperson, fluent in English, Hes not like the other dudes in campus who blabber pointlessly in English. Apart from being a phodu, hes a very lazy. He's the only one in our corridor who goes to all classes, sleeps in time and wakes up early. Time spent together with him will always be memorable. I am positive that dokania will have a bright future. Good luck to him!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>

<p>Abhay, the first thing I get in my mind is your high cg which will make me jealous of you(just kidding :P). You helped me a lot during consys, without you it would have been a nightmare to me :D. I thought you were only studious but when I came to know more about you my impression had changed. Slightly short tempered, good gamer and games follower and you also have very good vocab which will make your gre score one of the best among our batch. All the very best for your bright future ahead. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
