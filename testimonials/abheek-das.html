<p>AbheeK Das ! :-D :-D The first time I caught a glimpse of this guy was in Workshop, where he was giving his best to make our lives easier by showing off his dexterity! ;) Even now he strives for the best! Only now, he gives a tough time with his ever-soaring enviable performance ! :-D It is true, good friends come into our lives out of the blue ! I don't know how and when you happened, but you are the declared closest possible friend I have made here!:-D We have done it all- those sweltering library hours together, teaching you ES, you enlightening me or rather embarrassing me with your stock of films and novels :P, staring at the night-sky and trying to relate it to our lives, the music classes together, hogging food, fighting with each other and then taking it in a stride, venting out frustrations at odd hours, listening to the fascinating stories of  the Chemistry Department, you trying to mock physics in every possible way even though you know its the best ( :P ) and I'll stop here to prevent this from becoming a super-long essay!:-|  And ya, thanks for introducing phrases like "kya zabardasti hai" into my dictionary .. Whenever I shall utter it, it'll definitely remind me of you! And friends, if you wanna conquer his heart, as he says, the road is through his stomach !:) Feed him well and he'll feed u back lots and lots of care and attention ! :-D
There's still one more year to go and I just hope for one thing ! From whatever I have known you till date,I know that there are only a handful of friends for whom you genuinely care, who mean the world to you and for who you at least try to remember their birthdays ;). By the time, we pass out, I hope to enter into that list :-D If not so ,at least do read these testimonials and have a hearty laugh once in a while :-), the 'busy,hardworking ,seeking for perfection'  kinda person that you are and always will be! ;) Wish u loads and loads of happiness in life ! :-D Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gargi-biswas">Gargi Biswas</a></p>
