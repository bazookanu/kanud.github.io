title: Abhijeet Mehrotra

<h1 class="page-title">Abhijeet Mehrotra</h1><p>Abhijeet is a fantastic guy. Extremely chilled out, good sense of humour, very friendly and it's  great fun to have him around. He's very intelligent and hence, he's very coding at almost everything he does. He's good at coding and has an intuitive grasp of economics. He's always the one who makes the most interesting and innovative contributions to the classroom discussions. He's a brilliant speaker too, amazing at giving presentations and in my opinion among the best that I have heard at BITS. Most importantly, he's a very good friend with whom you can have meaningful conversations about anything and someone who'll always be there to help you out. All the best! I wish you a great future ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Abhijeet is the most tumultuous neighbor one can have. If you leave a set of speakers unguarded with him around, rest assured he would bring the hostel down with sheer noisy rock music and endless rounds of gunfire while playing cs. During tests you would find this heavily caffeinated being running around exasperatedly on how he hasnt finished the syllabus and how his delhi ass would be royally fucked the next day. He is also the human litmus test for any allergen in the whole wide world and the proud owner of the most cluttered room and desktop around. This apart, Abhijeet is a very helpful guy. He and I share a unique ability of emitting certain noises which used to be a hit once upon a time <sigh>. Enjoyed competing with him in nfs and split second (he is a damn good gamer) and playing tt in the common room. Hope you have fun in Singapore and have an awesome life ahead. . .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>Mehrotra! Crazy bastard with the most awesome handwriting ever! Smart as hell, self-sufficient, knowledgeable, helpful, frank, hardworking, intelligent, and a complete and total ass. That kind of sums you up. Add to that one of the very few people I consider friends. Definitely a future big-shot finance guru (:P), instilling new life into pseudo-dead companies :D Your interest and insight in the field shocks me at times, and you better not let it go with CS next year. And despite all the future successes, you better not lose touch once we're outta here! It has been amazing all this while, and I hope it lasts a lot longer than college does!

<p>Mehhhhhh...
His introduction to BITS was through the infamous sand with aluminium throwing incident in the Workshop. The only workshop lecture everyone attended and he was the centre of attention, singled out for punishment. Aah those fond memories. Abhijeet is an awesome guy. He's always ready to hang out with you, always has a wise (by his terms) opinion on things, and always give you company over a bottle of "stag". A little crazy, a little at unease with his own existence (always trying to kill himself), a little eccentric and very serious about his economics stuff, this guy is sure to do well in life...if he survives it, that is. :D All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
