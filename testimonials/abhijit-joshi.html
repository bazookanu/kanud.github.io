<h1 class="page-title">Abhijit Joshi</h1><p>Abhijit Joshi, or "Joshi ji" as some of his metrosexual seniors call him, is one of the best and most sincere guys you would find in the campus. Be it North Korea, campus academics, Indian Air Force, Shahi food, Cadence Assignments, he has an opinion on each and every thing, and all of them are based on proper research and not mere wayward opinions. With his witty one liners, and humourous take on each and every thing on campus, he adds charm and has been an integral part and a central pillar of DoJMA for the past three years, and as the Chief Editor, he has played an important role in all the work that DoJMA did in 2011-2012. His work as a member of Branding and Publications team, and as a student co-editor of BITSCAN has been exemplary, and of high quality. His love for perfection is also visible in his academics, as he one of those rare species of 9.4+ CGPAs, missing only a handful of classes in this course. Another fact that sets Abhijit apart from most people, is his vast knowledge on each and every topic under the sun, be it global or Indian politics, military or the English Literature. His gtalk status messages are a special trait of him, with them either acting as a breaking news, or a sarcastic take on a recent happening. His calm and composed mindset are his additional qualities, that help him manage everything in a balanced and mature manner. In a nutshell, Abhijit Joshi, is a down to earth, intelligent, witty, spontaneous person; but more than that he is a true friend, one you would cherish for life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>
<p>As pandeyji has rightly said, he is indeed one of those rare species of 9.4+ guys.
we first met in thermodynamics class of abhishek kumar, talked about "the" "the"  and "the" waale jokes, and since then, we've known each other.
one thing that i would like to thank him  for is regarding EEE assoc. elections in our 1st year. he helped me a lot for getting those precious votes and voted for me even while i got messed up in my speech. it was he who called up ppl and convinced them to vote for me. that's abhijit. thanks!!
with he being one of the most active dojma member, abhijit is a very sincere and regular reader of newspapers. he is also a regular reader of various books and novels. a true journalist to the heart. He is one of those "actually busy" guys on gtalk, walk in in his "actually clean" room, and u'll see a long list of chat windows open. abhijit doesnt show any attitude to clear doubts, irrespective of his or your cg. and in fact, he actually knows "how an induction motor works".be it any EEE CDC, he will fodufy it. his list of disciples included Mr.K.Chandram, our power systems teacher. the class just wont start without abhijit in the class. finally, thank you for all the help during EEE CDCs.

& one thing for sure, i am gonna miss your epic trademark dialogues "vaah, vaah!!" and "fod di".
Best of luck for your future...!!  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>
<p>Joshi is the most hardworking and intelligent people I've known in campus. This guy does everything perfectly. We have worked together for almost 3 years together for DoJMA now. And DoJMA was the reason we became such good friends. He has been the back bone of the department. Apart from work, he is just an amazing friend. Pinging joshi on gtalk is like a routine. He is the best guy to talk to about anything related to politics and north korea or just anything in the world(specially on gtalk). Truly a knowledge bank. From taking his class notes to interviewing people together, from gossiping about people to long discussions on politics, from CAT classes to random chit chat at mongi it's been a fun journey.  I wish you all the best TulsiDasKhan!   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Abhijit Joshi is a very unique person in many ways, be it one of those superhuman guys who have a cg of over 9.5, or the only person to regularly attend the lectures of some of the most boring professors Bitsians have ever had the misfortune of being taught(i don't need to mention who they are ;)) or his exemplary focus on the work at hand, or his spontaneity. During exams his room is usually flocked with people from all corners of the hostel, seeking to clear doubts from him. His knowledge about the world in general is amazing, be it politics or sports or the latest missile technology. He is the only person I have met who always has a news website open. He is an ardent lover of books and has a keen interest in anything related to military(especially in air crafts). His gtalk status messages are usually epic. They reflect a lot about him, be it his sarcastic humor or his take on the latest happening in some god-forgotten country in some corner of the world. He also happens to be a very sensible person. All in all, a person who will surely leave an indelible mark on your life. My best wishes to you Abhijit, you will go a long way ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>

<p>I regret getting to know him rather late into our time here. Abhijit is a perfect perfectionist if there ever was one. Be it academics or DoJMA or the hostel newsletter, however small the thing is, it has to be done perfectly. He is perhaps the only guy in our batch who actually understands concepts in Electrical. 
He is a fellow aircraft/military enthusiast. This common factor has resulted in hours of discussions and URL exchanges. Always one of the first to be aware of some news, he stays true to his journalistic instincts by rigorously reading all the magazines in the library, some 3 news sites (that I’m aware of) and a newspaper. He has a strange infatuation with North Korea (and their press releases claiming ‘volcanic ferocity’ :D ). 
He is the one who is always ready to help you out, his spotless room always inviting. He is sort of a benchmark with whom every EEE guy is compared. An amazing guy to have long serious (and sometimes out of the world whacky) conversations with. Will cherish the times spent. All the best.

<p>I regret getting to know you rather late. Just over a year I guess. Ever since I have spent everyday in the awe of you and I'm sure I'm not the only one. You don't seem to realize how awesome you are, and oh my god! ever so modest! I will miss the endless arguments we have had, especially regarding the current affairs and you pulling my leg about feminism. you have an uncanny obsession with war games/movies and north Korea, god only knows for what reason. Thanks for introducing me to RON, I am looking forward to beating you at it one day!(i know i will)

<p>Abhijit Joshi, which I used to spell as Abhijeet before (Sowie!) is a great guy and I respect him for a number of qualities of his. He is a very hardworking and diligent being. Whether be it DoJMA or his academics he has always given his very best to whatever it is that he does.
He has worked for hours to make our DoJMA issues a success. Working with him during the Summer Issue was great fun, especially the 1000 hits  (Yeah, We did it! :D ); I would like to thank him for his editing and writing and tips and talks during the SPREE Issue.
My most memorable time with him was during our Aditi Rao interview - the finish to which we got by getting an epic naxalite-cum-retard pic of ours clicked with her oh-so-poised frame!
I have always always enjoyed reading every piece of his writing!!!
I wish him all the very best for the future. Keep in touch :)
Cheers, =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/namrata-nadkarni">Namrata Nadkarni</a></p>
<p>Redifining the word 'PRO' in his own way, Abhijit is one among the elites who have been barely paying their semester fees by building up an off-the-charts CG. This might lead one to think of him as a geek/nerd. But strangely enough, he somehow manages to watch movies & tv series and stay up to date with news from every corner of the world. Simply _/\_. He has an opinion about everything under the sun, be it a war in some god-forsaken place that nobody knows, exists or the hot topics on campus. His unmatched knowledge on current affairs really gets me thinking- "Is he talking about the same world that I live in??!! O.o"  And his room!! It might be the cleanest you'll ever find on campus, but that's one place you would'nt want to be when exams are on, as it's swarmed by people seeking to clear their doubts in any subject that he might have accidentally aced! :D (Or to just get his blessings... :P) I've known him for 3 years now and I know for sure that when the time comes, he's the one person you can count on. One of the greatest friends i've ever had, here's wishing you all the very best for your bright future. Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-balakrishnan">Siddharth Balakrishnan</a></p>
<p>I first knew Abhijit only as the DoJMA second-yearite who'd call me up for Quark wiki-page write-ups. But it was in my second year that I really got to know Abhijit Joshi- as one of the most efficient, hard-working and approachable seniors we had. Always enjoyed his witticisms (sometimes even when they were directed at us, the military ranks thing for one :P). I was kind of clueless about the working of our Department, and talking to Abhijit helped me learn the ropes.
 Besides being an awesome writer, Abhijit Joshi is also a (how shall I phrase this?)..a nerd! Keeping up the DoJMA tradition (now dead) of high grade points, he's always managed all his responsibilities (academic and otherwise) really well.  In fact, from PS allotments to MT lab exams and Newsletter debacles, Abhijit has always been just a ping away whenever I needed his advice. Wishing him all the best for everything (expecting your success stories to feature on the Google Group :P )! Stay in touch :) Take care! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/null">NULL</a></p>
<p>You were the only one I felt I could share personal talks with. <--- Umm...the sentence doesn't sound so right. Maybe there's an error. Ah...! Anyway, you won't be able to edit it now. :P You've been great, as an editor, as a person, and your 1 liners have been awesome. No, seriously. Your wit is amazing. And, with the hardwork and passion you've shown towards your work, be it for the campus or friends or DoJMA or acads, you've gained a lot of respect. :) 
Okay, there's one thing I'm really gonna miss. Whenever you were there in my room, my friends didn't use to disturb me. Arre that was such a big relief. Leave your CH1, come stay in my room only for ur 4th year :P 
Anyway, thanks for being there. :) I sincerely pray and wish that success never leaves you. Whenever, I'll feel the same way, blue, I'll look up to how you were, and it'll be all right. It's time to sign off. But, I hope we'll meet again in life. It isn't going to be over so soon, just like this. Take Care. And, all the very best. :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavul-gauri">Bhavul Gauri</a></p>
<p>Abhijit is one of my closest BITSIAN friends. The first word that strikes my mind when i think of him is 'excellence'. Be it a CDC, be it DoJMA work, be it a godforbidden AAOC course, be it anything from interests to dislikes, he excels in it. His ability to manage acads, DoJMA work and free time is surely above everyone else in our batch and probably our campus too. Here is a quote that suits him perfectly: "A diamond is a piece of charcoal that handled stress incredibly well." And yes, he is probably the only guy from '09 batch who loves as well as *understands* Electrical engineering. Not to mention, he is the EEE/ENI topper of 
'09 batch. He and his room are like God in a temple. A small difference being that God solves devotees' problems in life while Abhijit solves students' doubts in acads. His sincerity is amazing. At times, he has been the only person to be present for the lecture in a class of 60+ students!!! I have seen him work (acads+DoJMA) till 4am in the morning, sleep for 2 hours, get up at 6am and attend lectures!!! I just enjoy reading the funny comments he writes in his notes about the incidents which happen in lectures. I had always enjoyed his witty nature and spontaneity, especially while having food with our group. Some of the course feedbacks he has written are just EPIC LOL! His gtalk status messages apart from hilarious, show what he is upto and are like "headlines of today's news" to me. His General Knowledge, passion for military and politics is just _/\_ He spends hours together in the library reading articles related to military and politics from various journals and newspapers. He loves to read novels too. He was the Cheif Editor for DoJMA for the academic year 2011-12 during which DoJMA had 10 releases ( 1 in the summer 2010-11, 3 in sem1 and 6 in sem2) which just shows how dedicated and sincere he is to his job. DoJMA was both, a job as well as a passion to him. Thanks to him, I started watching TV series and infact he is a fellow-lover of the american tv show "24" (thanks a lot for suggesting it dude :) ). He is very modest, trustworthy and sensible. He always supported me as a good friend, including the times when I really got stuck with my life. His timely advice and "aim high" attitude have always earned my great respect for him. Thanks a million for being my friend. Will surely miss the fun we had in these 3 years. Wish you all success! :)

I've known Abhijit for three years now. First, as a dojma colleague. Then as a friend. And lastly, as the brains behind the department DoJMA, and also as a true blue phodu (that rhymes!).
A passionate and persevering perfectionist, this trait of his is impossible to glean from his always cheerful and light hearted presence, or his witty and jovial nature. But then the results speak for themselves. Not that i need to mention, for it is so obivious, but for the record- has phodufied all his subjects (and i'm not talking just about es-2 or other electrical courses), all the while handling the terrifically responsible job of the chief editor of DoJMA (a post which demands huge commitments the year round, sans the limelight). But then people like him are never motivated by the limelight- in him i see true loyalty for the betterment of the department and the quality of it's work. No doubt, it is this characteristic of his that when applied to all his commitments makes him the phodu he is.
Is as sincere towards his friendships as he is towards his work. If you know him you wont help but notice all the characteristics of a person which distinguish him as a "true friend".  
Has an amazing sense of humour, and can cracks jokes laced with his unique take on life and happenings around him. It's a treat just to be near this guy when he's in his element! :D
I don't know if i really have to spell this out, but anyway i will- i have always appreciated and admired (and always will) you and the moments we've spent together. Hope to have many many more of them in the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-palnitkar">Aditya Palnitkar</a></p>
<p>Haven’t seen a more blunt, no- nonsense and yet fun (yea, weirdly :P ) person, who has taken it upon himself to keep everyone updated with his amazing gtalk statuses. Love the way you never mince your words about anything. T’was awesome working under/with you ?

<p>Joshi Abhijit Mohan has been my friend in this campus right from the first day !! At first i thought he was a stupid person. But then after seeing his marks I understood that he was not only stupid, he was smart too :P .At first he appears as a normal person who goes on with his daily chores. But very few have seen his true colors and his mischievous side. He is an extremely helpful guy and he was the reason I did well in many subjects. Abhijit is the most disciplined fellow on campus and he attends all the classes no matter what. A topper in various subjects he has also managed to balance studies with extra curricular activities. His contribution to DoJMA is legendary. We share similar taste in movies. Joshi likes all B grade hindi movies , "Gunda" being his favorite. We must have spent a considerable amount of time criticizing and making fun of such movies !! JAM as we fondly call him, has always been a defense fanatic. He regularly checks sites like bharatrakshak.com daily and is updated about the diplomatic relations of almost all countries with India. He has a fascination for aeroplanes and loves playing H.A.W.K. and air control light. Not many people know about his singing talent, mainly because he is too shy to sing in public. He is a terrible piano player and always interrupts me with his random key-pressing. He has immense respect for women and will attack(punches and blows :O) any person who says anything derogatory. Although he is very popular among girls, his biggest lover and stalker is Rajshekar. Abhijit's sense of humor is pre-historic and he laughs at even the most poorest of my pj's.His evergreen dialogue "waah" is used by almost everyone in the corridor. He is a very down to earth guy and believes in "simple living high thinking" .  One can recognize him from a distance because he always wear his signature 'dark tshirt with jeans' . A fellow cuppa noodles fan, he is ever ready to give away his stock of noodles and biscuits to the needy. I have been lucky to be his close friend and will always cherish the moments we shared together. I want to write so much but words won't be enough to express this wonderful human being. His height may be short but the shadow of his intellectual impression he casts behind him is long and grand. May the future bring you luck , success and happiness. Snehitarige yavagalu nivu iruttade. :)
