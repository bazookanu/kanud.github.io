<p>Pathak the real dude this campus will ever have :) Whatever be the problem , scenario .. you can expect a cool , carefree , tension-less approach from him towards that. He is one of my close friends on campus. We have shared a very special friendship since last 3 years, We had some amazing times in campus and all over around Goa. Pathak is one type of guy with whom you will like to hangout. He is funny in his own way. He should have tried for Roadies but nevertheless he can go to Splitsvilla also :) . He has a very cool attitude which makes him special in his own way. I am very lucky to have some one like pathak in my friend circle and we will continue our friendship forever :) All the best for whatever you do in your life. Be in touch :o)  Now GM :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swapnil-saurav">Swapnil Saurav</a></p>
