<h1 class="page-title">Abhinay Choday</h1><p>Very great artist that was the first impression on you. I still remember the time I was behind you all the time till you gave me a portrait of me :D. Later our common interest towards gaming brought us closer. You are too crazy about gaming and movies.  I used to play games and watch movies depending on your review. Please be in touch and do the same in future too. :D           Vijay<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>Remember those days wen we fight for keyboard and mouse to play prototype ,spider man .. :D and finally we decided one will operate mouse and other keyboard and play the game \m/ \m/ .
  i am gonna miss the  way we discuss new ideas  (almost about every other thing we see :| ) , the way we comment while watching cricket together , and many more things we used to do 
we started dota together .I cannot forget  ps1 in Hyderabad (Your chapathi story , how you kicked BABAI for you know what :P) .
Here comes the main thing , the way you walk (you must be playing games when you are supposed to learn how to walk ) ,it appears like you are walking on a rope in air and trying to balance every step.  
Keep in touch :-) .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradeep">Pradeep</a></p>
<p>U r the most intelligent guy n a great artist.Pro gamer.U r a completely different person i have ever met especially the childish acts n u r super hero stunts u wish to try.The car we built ,where we both of us spent most of time in workshop .The fights with u during that time whatever we did a decent job  no regrets. During PS i had a great fun with u ,the story i created which made u so angry on me i still remember those days (although  pradeep added fuel :) )the movies we watched together i will never forget these moments with u.All the best for future :) dont change be urself it suited most :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/katta-rajesh">KATTA RAJESH</a></p>
