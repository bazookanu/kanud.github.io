<h1 class="page-title">Abhiraj Tomar</h1><p>Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar or APST ( how u introduced ur self ) or tommy ( which is very common) or just "tomar" (by which i call u like many others ).It all started on 28 july 2009( the very day I came to BITS,) when i met 2 guys in the hostel ground form/near my hometown sitting and chit chatting and since then it has been a hell of ride. It still cant forget the time you guys came to rescue me from ragging in ah6 and how u eventually ended up being ragged by me . then there were days when we sat in your old room (139 ) gossiping about almost everyone we knew in campus. There were those footpath bitching sessions where we would talk talk endlessly throughout the night. there are so many things if i start pinning them them down i would i would end up making course tomar c111 :P . In short  You have been a part of almost of my experiences in campus form being in dosm , csa elections (2yr) , coordi selection you were always there with me .  
I believe people dont see you the way i do i see you as a person with great listening skill , guy with patience, a guy who is caring and a guy with morals ( i mean it ). There are moments when you act like whore who just wants everyone's attention and then there are those where you act like the "older & wiser". You are the one guy on campus whom I would like to share and talk my heart out, I know i have at times forced to hear me out even when you didnt like to coz u were sleepy at even 3 at night ,thanks for bearing me and helping me out in whatever situations it be. He is one guy who can waste all of his time on chatting  that is  for fact i have seen u chatting to people for like 2hr in a stretch. You are the one trustworthy chap who wouldn't care what people would say about me to him and he would still defend my case with them even without listening my side of the story; ( I still dont know why people come and bitch about me to you even though they know you are one of my best buddies on campus). I still havent found out whats your secret in scoring those fucked up AAOC courses, I dont think you are one of those coder types who sits and codes all day just for the fun of it. But here is the thing if he is given a job how tough it may be he will d whatever he can to finish it off in style, a true hard worker by nature.  Hope we remain friends forever and always stay in touch. Best of luck for all your future endeavors.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ananya-singhal">Ananya Singhal</a></p>
<p>Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar, bada naam, bade kaam. :P No I really mean it, this guy has achieved a lot and yet is less than his potential. We bonded over our talks about our homeland, Rajasthan, the culture, the food, the people... A real people person and a great friend. The witty humor and the funny shayari on the night out shall be missed. I wish you all the luck in life and may we keep in touch in future. Here are few words for u: "agar dekhna hai inke udne ka andaaz, aasman se keh do thoda aur ooncha ho jaye ! "<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>Writing this testimonial makes me realize 26 letters from English do not give enough combinations.....I am still gonna give it a shot with just some billions of combinations I have.........elements including a bitch, a slut (Rs. 40 one :P), a lesbian, an honest political leader, a soldier, a scientist, a philosopher, a psychiatrist, a CEO and may be a few tons of uranium might have combined together to give this godlike compound called Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar. This explosive has been given several names across the campus like Patidev(by Milind), Biwi(by Gudge),Daddy( by all assholes of campus), Awesome(by chuhiya)……for me the word is “Kutiya”.
Tommy........my friend, philosopher, brother, advisor, teacher, books, notes, syllabus, chiefy, bitch, bitch expert…in short almost half of my BITS life.….it is hard to believe but trust me this guy who sleeps in every class he goes is one of the most intelligent and hard working person in this campus...with tomar at work nothing is impossible...With his evil smile, insensitive approach and frivolous attitude he comes across as a total jackass but in reality that is just the attention seeking slut looking for her customers.....this guy is a very caring, sensitive, emotional and thoughtful friend of mine. A true friend and a criminal brain......this guy won’t give up on you even in the worst situations when u have given up on yourself. With his craziness, friendly attitude, leadership skills, marketing ideas and an all-round amazing personality I think he was the best Chief Coordinator DoSM had ever seen. There are countless people in this campus who think of him as a brother and ask him for advice....I am and will always remain one of them.
I met him at Bansal Classes 4 yrs back, I had no hint this 6 ft 2 inches 138 kg senior citizen is gonna be part of almost every memory I own of my college. We became friends during a leg pulling session conducted for some guy in Bansal and that’s what we have been doing for 4 years. Crazy trips to bogmalo, bagha, utorda, majorda...singing Kishore Da’s songs from gate to Mongini’s...luking for sweet dishes there...2 Litres of coke 4 people B-Dome stairs and a clean sky.....Ass kicking sessions anywhere and for anyone...Fifa 12 matches(btw u really are pro at it)..examination nights my foolish doubts and you my teacher....trips to Doodhsagar.....bagha beach New year’s eve, chapora fort….end sem packing…crazy discussions...rating scale(:P)...Train journeys...NaReal Awards (lets not elaborate :P) and many more
I have learnt a lot from you from each and every subject in CS to anger management. With your wise advises or cheerful jokes or patience or thoughtful approach to life or confident replies you taught me a lot....you are the actual definition of FRIEND......thanks for being there for me man. We all know you are an achiever and with all your unique qualities I know you are gonna find what you are looking for. Success is all yours buddy. 
I didn’t want it to be an essay but well there is just so much to write....there are some stories that are always amazing and are never supposed to end.....I know our friendship is one of them.....

<p>I feel strange while I am writing this... fear, anxiety - don't know how to classify it... cannot even camouflage it with fake sentimentality... Melange people searching for some adjectives please skip this....... Fuck you!!!!!.... why didn't you go to the PS division for PS sem change.... u deserve to rot here alone!!!!!!!.... u r one mean bitch who has seen such success here that hardly any other asshole could have!!!!!!... an enviable level of intelligence, personality n charisma but u bloody scumbag, u think u wont get recos if you don't  take PS in sem 1....  a herculean determination, I have seen you converting a mid sem 6 into 8.5 but on second thoughts u r really a rat....... 3 years of boga trips, utorda trips, vasco trips, DJ nites,  mongi seat warming sessions,"who is what in DoSm "sessions, "who will be what in Dosm" sessions and Satan knows what fucking else sessions...n all comes to an end with a testimonial!!!!!... do remind me to take a print out of this and shovel it up ur ass!!!!!!... (sigh)... its been an emotional terrain walking along side you.... we have seen so many colors and shades together, it just looks so unrealistic that its all....... i hope not!!!!!! I want to tell you all that you guys are one of the best things that has ever happened to me.... I sincerely hope this 'thing'  that we all share goes on and on and on...... of course u'll be a CEO bitch, but still u'll always remain a filhty mother-rapist sister-rapist rahul fucking bastard!!!!!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>
<p>He is as normal as one can get, I am not kidding. After a couple of years of knowing you, the only memory which stands out is of the Post Quark '11 spanking session. I guess we both found a new muse that night and the campus got two more entertainers. He is a freshie's idol, a batch-mate's envy and a senior's pride. You have come a long way, quite literally, but then, there are miles to go. People above have listed all your traits, I'd just say that they are correct as per my truest knowledge and there is nothing more to add. You lived upto the old DoSM tradition, I guess I might break it this year. Your memory shall linger in the minds of all those who aim for the glory of top-notch Nareals. May lady luck be by thy side and lead you to greater fortune. Life is kind, I know you know it, just stop denying it! To satisfy your sentimental side, I will miss you. Fuck it, I will not, we will keep in touch.
Your successor,
Neil Merchant

<p>Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar. At the first sound of it, sounds like a Nawab riding a horse galloping towards you to cut your head off.
He on the other hand is completely opposite, the guy can't harm a bug even if he wanted to. He is one of those persons, who can make all your 
stress, all your problems, all your pain in life vanish away within moments. He does so, I believe by absorbing them from you and adding them to his own. He will give you whatever you want, whenever you want it. I have had the best moments of my life with him(not some of, all of them). We have been each other's lead support team for all the mischievous,crazy endeavours we have carried out. This is the person who makes you open your heart out. He will listen to hours to all the crap you want to say, compassionately nodding his head at your every statement. I don't even remember when I met him for the first time. It is like he was always there, and will always be there no matter what. He is one of the few people who can actually see through me, whatever I do to hide it. His attitude towards life, "Jo Bhi Karo, Khud Ke Dam Pe", inspires me everyday. He always does thing the right way, it may be the most difficult one yet he follows it consistently.
One moment he will be the shoulder you can dump your problems on and the next moment he will mocking the hell out of you, making you think why do you even like him.
What people fail to see, that this is exactly the reason you love him.
He will do all the crazy stuff, make you feel like killing yourself, but believe me, he hurts himself more than you ,thinking about it over and over again, when he does it.
His unique sense of communicating, and making you relaxed from the first moment you meet him, makes him likable in the first meeting itself. Inspite of all the crazy stuff he does, he has a very strong value set, and will always stand tall in front of any problem. 
He has developed this unique skill by which he is able to analyse any situation, or event critically and always comes up with an explation for it. He is able to correctly identify the pitfalls, wrong practices in any given  activity which is causing it to fail. This I 
believe is possible due to his approach towards all things in life which includes complete understanding of the fundamentals involved in the domain. He is one of the very few people who thinks like an engineer in the real sense of the word. 
I would have been nowhere in life without the valuable time I spent with him, the knowledge I gained from him, the help I have got from him all along. I cannot express my gratitude for all that he has done for me, it is practically not possible. 
The only promise I make is that I will be the first person to have free ice-cream at the shop he plans to open, whiche describes is his ultimate goal in life :P For all that you have done for me Brother, I love you Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar....

<p>Tomar! I don't remember when I first met him exactly. He was the shy, well-oiled hair, nerdy type guy, with a pedophilic smile and a fat belly. That was then. Only that smile's unchanged. This guy is a complete achiever. The first thing that comes to my mind is your ability to calm people down. I can't recount how many times I've ended up saving myself from doing something pretty stupid, thanks to you. I just talk to you for a while, and suddenly things seem much clearer. You always have a plan. And you'll always say the right thing, the encouraging thing that I want to hear. I guess that's what makes you a great manager of people. Can't recall the amount of times. Of course, there are times when you just go crazy, doing what you're known for best in campus. (read:Na-Real awards). Though it takes real courage to go on stage and proudly give a speech on your tharkiness. No matter in what deep shit you are, you always find strength to go on. And you give others that same strength. To me, there's that one moment I'll never forget; that time in the bus, when you gave that little push. I guess you didn't even realize how much that changed things. (I hope it did atleast :P ) I admire you for the way you balance everything. You've been one of my closest friends ever. I always trust you to have my back (though you always have your dose of fun first). You'll put the greater good above your needs or ego. And that's why so many people look upto you. You're like everyone's big daddy, with occassional fits of insanity. We've had some crazy times together which I'll always cherish. Except that New Year's night(mare). Wish you were there in sem2 with us. Wish you all the best in life, and hope we keep in touch for a long long time.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>10p who got vertical from ENI to CS - first impression of this gentleman from the land of rich culture, Rajasthan, his name itself reflects his huge royalty. Quiet tall chap who always has a bag on his back seen mostly near library or in common room support ARSENAL ( Seriously? ), but in due course of time he is grown close being as one of those special friends on campus. His observation skills are just too brilliant and no words can describe that, his hindi and those awesome lines he creates on the spot , sheer treat to listen to them. He does has a nack of cracking on the spot jokes, love to take case of people and happily laughs when someone does the same to him. Coming to campus activities, I respect him for his totally absent political presence, his awesome work in fests right from the second year when he had no worldly tensions of CG :P. His work in DePP and Dosm is highly appreciable. To many he appears to be chutiya or pervert, but he is true simple person who loves to have fun masti and live life spreading smile, he doesnt have any bad feelings against anyone in his heart its just fun that he wants and he tries to do. His jokes at times to become nasty but then he is humble enuf to accept his mistakes at times and move on with a smile again. Those awesome times chatting to him, discussing things which cant be shared has been an awesome journey. I must accept he has been a good leader, leading a versatile team with totally varied co-ordinators he has made success, making every fest a big success, be it making Waves better, creating a milestone with Quark or Innovating Spree, he has been splendid. The relation he shares with juniors is awesome, they feel friendly and share their problems with him openly without a fear, I like this quality. I like his quality to speak it out on the face, it helps a lot he thinks and takes sides based on the decision and isnt biased, this is what I have seen him. 
Awesome times with you, be it those sem start bogmalo trips or random talks in campus. Looking forward to an awesome sem together. 
Of the recent, we have been the soft targets being threathened to be thrown out of our new hostel rooms, but then together it shall be fun.

PS. Be the man you are dont change ever. Ek book likh daal ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>I still laugh at the fact that you were actually scared of me initially. I’m glad DoSM came along and I got to know you a lot better. The best part about being Tomar is how you can connect with people so very effortlessly and chat up with them as childhood friends. On the other hand, I was amazed at your twisted mind! Tu kitna sochta aur analyze karta hai ! Humesha itna complicated nahi hota :P I remember, trying to get some sense into you was such a task, almost like World War 3!
But I also know that no matter when, if I want to speak to someone, I can give you a call. You’ll listen, unless there is an arsenal match on, I’m guessing. ;) 
It is great to see all of you together. It was a lot of fun being around all of you – during the festivals and otherwise just sitting around on campus.  The whole bunch of you just manage to bring a smile to my face! If nothing else, DoSM gave me a chance to know a bunch of really good people. 
Teri itni achchai kaise kar di – pata nahi. Buddha ho gaya hai. But you’ll always be a kid to me. ? I know my set of treats is still pending, and I shall give you one soon enough. I haven’t forgotten. 
Stay the same, take life as it comes, don’t think too much always ;) Keep working, keep your set of friends and my god, does it feel weird to write you a testimonial. Cannot imagine that you people have grown up and will be leaving campus soon. All the best for life. It really is not very easy out there, but I’m sure you’ll do a brilliant job.
Cheers!
P.S. It is not very easy to put everything into words for all of you. Some things are just special and are best kept to one’s self. ? All the times spent together is something which I will always cherish. It is a basket of memories which I take with me. Thank you for being a part of it.  -- Madhu Singh <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Abhiraaaj, prataap singh tomar.. as heavy as it sounds  .. :P .. the only thing which i dont like, is you support arsenal >.< , common any other team would be fine, even chelsea would be better, why arsenal .. !  
okay now coming to the point, i remembering getting close to u and singal in one of the DOSM outings to bagha (in my 1st yr) , Even though i was a junior, you were so friendly and open, yes, tharki back then too.. no wonder u have won the nariel award too for that ! 
tommaar aka tommy, as we all fondly call him, you have been an awesome co-ordinator for DOSM. So many things we had this year, that were perhaps missing, and brought it to new level ! 
The help and support which you gave to me, thank you for everything . I wanted to clarify a thing, why so you enjoyed getting spanked by Neil ? :P  
I also remember the chats , and tharki ness, we all did, during Waves, Quark , the banner time ( although there is not much to see in Quark ) . Truly these times will be cherish, 
Thank you once again for all things you have taught me, and keeping faith in me and my work, truly you have been a awesome senior. i always look forward to take you advice whenever i am trouble, and ill keep torturing you in future :D .
Keeep in touch, dont loose that inborn tharkiness talent , and have a great future ahead !

PS- United the best team , please start supporting them !  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manank-gosalia">Manank Gosalia</a></p>
<p>Tomar !!! Ala Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar !! He is the tharkiest, cheapest, the most shameless guy I have ever met. Ok then Why am I writing this testimonial ? Coz actually he is none of the above. Abhiraj, no matter how weird it sounds, is one of the most genuine persons I have ever seen. Yes, all that tharkiness, all those cheap jokes, all is just Naatak. Once you get to know him you realise what an awesome person he is. He has inspired optimism in me through the roughest times, stood next to me fighting for me and our department against the most furious and angry group of people, he has has endured my long 1 hour mobile calls patiently listening to all my woes and troubles, and has always provided a level minded and practical solution to each of the problems I faced. Those late night work sessions that would often get converted into 'chick' talks, bitching about campus people, cracking incessantly funny and senseless jokes, MAN, I would never realise it before it was 3 AM, that we need to stop all the time pass and go back to our rooms. Abhiraj has always been a true source of moral support to me. I have always admired his drive to live his life to the fullest. Waves and DoSM would have never been the same without you. Cheers to the awesome work, the awesome festival, and the awesome camaraderie that was a by product. Hope it continues !!

<p><center>And then the Lord said let there be Happyness</center> <br>
<center> And there was… </center> <br>
<center> Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar </center> <br>
I met you the first time, out side the library with Ananya after your EG midsem. The way you talked and presented yourself, you looked like an ubercool d00d.(Ofcourse i was wrong :p). And then we started knowing each better as days passed by. Din, Mahine, Saal… I am not going to say what kind of person he is, either you understand Tomar or you don't. If you had the fortune of meeting him in the past three years and you are simple enough to understand the beauties of the world, you know what i am talking about. Its difficult to remember one day of BITS life since 2-1 without you. Without you in the last bench Modern Physics class, without you sitting besides me in those luncheons and dinners in the mess, without you in those bogmallo-sitting-at-the-beach sessions. Its tough to imagine my life without you here. If sitting next to one's friend and hear him go how world is just a stage and we all actors, and see your friend go ga ga about his crush, hear your friend go sentimental and all philosophical when it comes to matters of life; if standing by your friend and holding him close by your heart; if being there with your friend, always, through everything; if making your friend comfortable in your presence… is called as the true definition of a friend. Then my dearest friend, you complete me. You complete me as maths completes physics(sorry, cant find a better isomorphism). I cant let a day go pass without seeing you or talking to you. I need to talk to you, not for your sake, but mine. I talk to you and everything looks reasonable, I talk to you and world seems simple to me, I talk to you and world seems a nice place to live in, I talk to you and life is worth living. Talking to you at the end of the day is like reciting the day's stories to my self. I think at times, that we are too dependent on each other. But then when I look back and see the utter bliss, happiness moments with you, those utter "be what you are Milu" moments… Its fucking worth it. Its worth everything. They might not understand you, I do. And i know what lies beneath all those layers, that heart, that iridescent soul, that charming ever helpful nature, that Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar. For all that has happened, for all that you have done, for all that we have been through together, for all that you have stood for, for all that you aim, for everything, I love you Abhiraj Pratap Singh Tomar.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>THE ULTIMATE !! tomar is a guy who can make you laugh for hours and hours together!! I knew this guy for about 3 months or so but when ever we sit and have a conversation it turns out to be epic!! Highly professional and dedicated this guy is an entertainer , Had a wonderful time with him and am sure he will succeed in anything he does ( you know what i mean ;) ) all the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
