<h1 class="page-title">Abhishek Arun</h1><p>"Chin2" a real good friend an awesome guy! I have never seen him sad. he s d most cheerful guy around. He makes ppl laugh n i mean literally he s a great actor cum friend/ has a wierd sense o humour sometimes I dont get it. From pakistani roadies/Haryanvi awesomeness to Blue Collar ***** he s a mixture of fun n what not. That "seal bark" cracks open my ribs. an attitude for anything without even giving a moment's thought.He epitomises all things quintessentially good in campus. If you dont know him , then you suck. I love the black mark( you know what m talking about)..yo motuu ! cheers to Japan n the time to come! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikunj-sharma">Nikunj Sharma</a></p>
<p>Motu....probably my first good friend in campus,our relationship started when we discovered our shared love for a certain something(which was hard to get by those days).His cute, childish looks together with his fun-loving and extremely friendly nature makes him one of the most lovable guys in campus.He is one guy I can kiss and not feel gay.(i don't know why I wrote that).A multi-talented person,he is the drama club coordinator ,and his singing,rapping, and beat-boxing skills are better than most.Along with being a natural story teller,his imitations(Mandar,Deepu,Tony) is absolutely hilarious. We have helped each other climb new walls in life(:P), and shared some memorable experiences and awesome night-outs together.An all-star futsal player,he is also a good underarm bowler and a declining Fifa player.Terrace,lake,Nikunj's room,Tito's,Curlies,Amboli,Arambol all the time spent with you has been quite fantastic.A really smart,sharp-witted guy,he also showcases his dedicated,hardworking side in his commitment towards the Drama Club,which apparently means a lot to him.I have a feeling that he will go a long way in life.........Cheers Mote!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/asim-ali">ASIM ALI</a></p>
<p>Chintoo! The hairless, fat boy-wonder – whose first name I rarely remember. My first memory of Chintoo is him walking towards the mess beside Nikunj and I remember thinking that if the short guy had worn a red turban and waistcoat, it would’ve been exactly like the Chacha Chaudhary and Sabu duo. I got to know him properly after he was chucked out for sleeping in EG class (can’t blame you man). I thank my lucky stars that I did. He went on to become my knight in shining armor in the post-T1 incident when he was the one who found me after an epic manhunt. I remember going to meet him the next day to apologize for having caused so much trouble and realized, that despite having done something incredibly irresponsible and stupid, he wasn’t opinionated about it and didn’t judge me by it. That, I believe, has been the single most important reason for us being very close friends. That and his brilliant comic timing. Chintoo is, by far, the funniest and most entertaining person I’ve ever met – one of my favorite people to hang out with. He’s a brilliant actor and has top-notch mimicking & rapping (!) abilities. He’s also extremely passionate about making random home videos, discovering epic videos online and SRK movies. The Drama club has won numerous accolades under his leadership. Besides this, like me, he has the honor of being his warden’s bête-noire and Moorthy’s pinching post. I think if Veet ever comes out with a waxing product for men, Chintoo would be their brand ambassador. He’s one of the most down-to-earth and genuine people I know who taught me how to party like my life depended on it. He suffers from the plight of being Sinha’s wife, but he’s still the life and soul of the entire group. He’s one of those irreplaceable people and one I’ll miss sorely once we’re done with college. Japan aaunga main mote tujhe milne, we’ll try Sake together – if you haven’t had it already…<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Gurvinder Akash Singh....log mujhe GAS bulate hain'. It's been 3 years since we crafted that masterpiece of a play, and what a journey it's been! Big break was where we first hit it off, with our Lalu and Rajeev Khandelwal act. Shooting random videos (Joaker, Optimistic Raj), getting stoned and laughing at chodu CID, getting stoned and laughing for no reason at all, witnessing sathe's belly dance first hand - I cannot possibly jot down all the epic moments we've had on this campus. The funniest guy i've met by far, Chintz can make me laugh at anything, any time of the day. Right from Chanachips, to 'Ab kiska kata' - we've generated so many phrases, so many anecdotes, that I won't look back at these times with a mere smile on my face - I'll be laughing my socks off. Chintoo really stepped up to the challenge as the Drama Club coordinator, and the club has truly flourished under him. Here's hoping we never lose touch, here's hoping for an epic 4-2 with you, and here's hoping that Chintz & Charkz productions will never die out :P Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
