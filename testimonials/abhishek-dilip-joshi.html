<p>He is the nicest person i ever met. He is my partner of DECO lab. Taking practicals of DECO was fun only because of you. He is very bad in remembering faces and names specially of girls. He loves to check record of students and then give them harsh comments on it. Very nice person by nature. We have lots of special moments which includes the reason for missing your TEDX inductions, the way we used to evaluate verilog questions and many more....... 
I am very much sure that our friendship will remains as it is. I am fortunate to have have a true friend like you. 
Hope you have a bright future ahead.......:)
