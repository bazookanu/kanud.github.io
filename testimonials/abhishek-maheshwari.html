<h1 class="page-title">Abhishek Maheshwari</h1><p>mahi is a dear friend of mine.He has his own way of doing things,like the time way we search almost all outlets in ps1 for sports shoes and one day suddenly he comes up with a shoe of his choice out of nowhere surprising us.Darki is one of the coolest guys i have ever come across.His doing things just at the end and doing it well is commendable,even when in submitting in his admission form he did it at the last day in Pilani,his taking li8 atttitude and taking about attitude, he has some and it suits his personality and defines him that makes him set apart.Confident, witty,humorous,intellligent(iitian & bitsian). Gem of a guy and my very special friend.Dude i will cherish each and every memory of us.Mahi with his chilled out attitude and dynamic personality will achieve milestones in his life and my best wishes are with you.Yo Mahesh!!!!!,maze aa gaye!!!

<p>Mahi has many names... Most popular among them is Deewane! 
An amazingly chilled out guy with bad habits like shopping :D
He can difuse even the most serious of situations with his sly wit and humor... A geek with a soft heart and truly a friend in need. Mahi always took care of all those around him. For me, he used to arrange all the notes and reports and stuff.. Damn good at FIFA and a total pro at physics! 
Time spent with him is like a long bout of laughter and fun... Dedicated and sincere, Mahi has a great devotion towards anything he sets his mind on. He is unstoppable. Its been a wonderful journey being his friend all these years, especially the long train rides to home and poking fun in classroom! :D
All the best bro.. you'll be missed greatly next sem and all the years after that! Pranaam! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-tiwari">Akshat Tiwari</a></p>
<p>Mahi :) One of my first friends on campus. We use to study together in 1st year ( after that i took li8 , but he kept on studying :D ) . I have many awesome memories with him . Almost 90% of my college trips are with him. Be it GoKarna , JogFalls , Bogmalo , Anjuna , IndiaFest or rest of Goa. Mahi is a very helpful person who will help you out irrespective of his condition. He is also good at Fifa ( not better than me though :) ) , CS and plays random games. Very Good in Physics . He has a very helpful and amazing personality which very few have in this campus.Best thing about him is that he has no EGO at all. Thats a great thing to have :) . Its been a wonderful journey till now and I am sure we will be friends forever. Be in contact . All the best for everything you do in future :D . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swapnil-saurav">Swapnil Saurav</a></p>
