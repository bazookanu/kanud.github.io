<h1 class="page-title">abhishek tripathi</h1><p>Abhishek  Tripathi. There's no one on campus who doesn't know this guy. Abhishek's one of those people who'll always be there for you, come what may. The never-say-die attitude will take this guy places, if he wishes to. All those times we've helped each other come to senses at Bogmalo will be treasured memories. One of my fondest memories of this campus life will be when it was just 3 of us went to Velino's in the middle of the compres to celebrate my birthday. And of course the awesome 3-1 Bogmalo nightout :D Abhishek's antics are legendary, and when we look back at this life 20 years later, it'll be filled with instances of the epic stuff he's done. He's one of the people I know will always have my back, financially or otherwise :D . Thank you for making college life, college life :) .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Tripathi.. One of the most famous personalities of the campus. My neighbour & one of my best friends in the campus.  He is always jealous me of having a better room than his( :D) and wishes of having come earlier than me.  He has gr8 sense of humour. He is very caring & always ready to help. We have spent countless hours with each other discussing past incidents in our life.  It is always fun to listen his childhood & school incidents. I wish he was my childhood friend. He is often called Mr. Dependable in the hostel. He is a person with selfless character and puts in hard work in everything he does. He is exam time saviour for me. Agar kuchh padhai nahi hui aur raat ko jagna hai toh uske room mein chale jao. He was rightly nominated for "Play buuoy".  It is fun to have him around & turns any situation into a laugh riot by just the way he speaks about it. There are many more things to write about him this space is too small for it.  I am glad to have a neighbour & friend like you.... I wish you all the best for your future.. Always be in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Abhishek Tripathi was one of the first person who I met on campus and we have gelled well in the last 3 years. Always with smiling face and determined attitude he’s a kind of friend everyone would want and must have. He’s one of the most selfless person I know and he is not a quitter literally.I will always the cherish the Zari visits in the middle of the exams, hostel terrace sessions, countless Bogmalo visits and all the wacky things we did in the college. Best of luck for future endeavors and I’m sure you will get that lavish pay you always wanted. Till the next time….Cheers!

<p>Abhishek is the first person i met on campus, and its been one great journey ever since. He's been there for everyone all the time in all capacities. He's very amicable, looks at life in a very different, optimistic way, and a very emotional character as well (he knows that). When i look back i am reminded of all the times we've sat up till late at night discussing and dissecting any random issue, running around the hostel to find food to eat and even studying the night before compres. The Bogmalo nights, the Velino trips, and our night-outs will be stories i will be telling my grand-kids just because he's in those stories. We've also seen him work really hard, and he has been rewarded for it, and i'm sure that shall be the case in the future too. Get that PPO and we shall party :D We would have loved to see him take the Play-Buoy Nareal home, but he will still be the original Play-Buoy for us. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>Abhishek is full of life and joy. He could walk into a damn crypt and turn it into a rave. He lives in the moment and doesn’t give a damn about the future. He has the most amazing of stories and the most vivid of personalities. He is an absolute pleasure to hang out with. If something is going down, you can count on Abhishek to have your back. An immensely passionate guy, I will always cherish the nights in bogmalo, velinds, on the rocks, in the boat and god knows where else we spent our days. I hope you never change and always get what you want!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shashank-acharya">Shashank Acharya</a></p>
<p>Abhishek is truly one of the most kind-hearted people i know. He is someone who is straight up, frank and tells is the way it is and this is one of the things i most admire about him. He's hard working and dedicated but he sure knows how to have his fun too! :P We've had some really good times in the last 3 years and i'm going to miss his, "abey, chudaap ho gaya be" stories! :D He has the ability to fill the room with smiles when he knows everyone is down and can totally change one's mood. My faithful NC partner, i will really miss this guy. Here's hoping this is the start of a long, long friendship! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Arey Tripathi ji!! Tripathi is one very kind-hearted, humble and helpful person. I got to know him fairly late in my BITS life, sadly, but what great company he has been. There is never a dull moment when he is around with all his anecdotes and unique style of talking. Very candid and straight-forward about things. Takes all the lame jokes I crack at him very sportingly. He is always game for fun and never to say no to a trip to Bogmalo or Velind. I have always banked on him  for notes before an exam and he has never disappointed. I know succeed in  whatever he does in the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
