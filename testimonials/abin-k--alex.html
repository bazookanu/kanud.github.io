<h1 class="page-title">ABIN K  ALEX</h1><p>Abin might be the best Centre Back this college has ever seen or will ever see but still it won't be wrong to label him as the laziest footballer either. Watching people defend isn't too much fun but watching this guy is. He is like the wall in the defence and almost impossible to walk past. His mere presence scares attackers away. Loves to hate Barcelona, Messi in particular. Is very witty, and knowledgeable. Fun to be around always especially after he has downed a few spirits. Makes awesome coffee.  A very dependable and helpful person.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Ur typical BITSian nerd and book worm,spent most of his bitsian days in the library.A pro at everything CS.U can always see him in the first bench for all the classes and during the exams people will be literally queuing in front of him room for his notes or clearing their doubts. He tried his hand at football once,miserably failed though(Didn't even make it in the team). No talent for sports whatsoever.A really boring guy to be around,speaks when only spoken to, doesn't engage himself in meaningless conversations and doesn't particularly enjoy making fun of others. Your typical Mr Innocent.
PS-Everything that I have typed so far bears no resemblance to the person,and if u do feel a resemblance thats probably bcoz u don't know him all that well :D.
Best of luck for the future DEWD :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>First impression is the best impression...But for Abin.K.Alex never judge him by his first impression.i hav never met a guy with such gr88 confidence in what he says nd does.From the 1st year itself we wer always at loggerheads (yeah...credits to fatima). we used to have lots nd lots of heated arguments ...mostly over Loyola nd lafest.But at the end of the day.. we wud end up watchin sum muvie nd fall asleep together :P.(no gay stuffs. :P :D).Most ppl knw him as a guy who goes around teasing other ppl with his witty dialogues.But he also has a sensitive side wer u could see hw kind,caring nd helpful person he is. He ws also my study partner fr first sem.The study plans which we made wer quite a hit !!! He has always helped me in difficult times in terms of cash funding as well as academics.. :P He has a strong appetite fr liquor.. :D He can completely empty up a BAR nd still be as steady as a rock.I need not tell much about his contribution to BITSFC as everyone knws it well. its like a treat to watch him play the defense position in futsal matches.His simple egoless attitude nd good chiseled looks hav gt lots of lady fans following him. im gonna miss all his late night kathi-adi's .:D. wish he ws here next sem . I ll miss u a lott.. keep in touch.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-">Rahul </a></p>

<p>Abin is one of those guys who has that really street boy kind of attitude towards everything. He can just keep playing something all the time, and never stop. His presence in the football field can take anyone out of their comfort zone, with his physical strength and determination and is simply the best all-round player in the team. As a person, he is a really fun guy to hang out with and one of the really admirable things about him is that he never stops for one second to think about what he is doing, and just lives the way he wants. As a CS student, he doesn't give a damn shit about computers and I bet many 12 year old kids out there know more than him :P. Also he is one hell of a tanker when it comes to boozing, and I would never advise anyone to compete with him on that. We share a passion for Real Madrid, Ronaldo and Netherlands and he is always available to take digs on The Messy buoy. So that's about Abin in a nutshell. It's been awesome to have known you here for the last 3 years.Keep in touch and keep living the high life :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>Abinaaaa, my partner in crime when it comes to pushing off, out-clevering and overpowering strikers (often Sinha, maybe not, hes not fit 'often'). Fellow center-back in football, hes certainly one of the best in the business, set aside Goa League. If i am called the 'raging bull', then hes nothing less than a 'fire-breathing dragon', an amazing player and a great friend, its been nothing less than a treat to know you. Abin takes competitive to a whole new level , this person will do anything to win, and i mean anything. Trust me when i say this for the whole team, we would not have won Goa League without you and we'll win SPREE next year, likewise. We've had our differences and fights on the pitch, but theres no denying, football is much more fun with you! (little gay, i know..) Off the pitch too we've had great times at bogmalo , manipal , especially bangalore. Gear up from SPREE dude, because next year, we're TAKING IT.
