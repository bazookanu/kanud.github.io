<h1 class="page-title">Abishek Ramgopal</h1><p>One of my few Tamil friends, "Rambo" always entertains you with his bursting laughter and of course academic discussions. He is one of very few people who is so passionate about studies and academics, to an extent of sacrificing anything for its cause. Highly motivated individual who is always so cheerful that one finds it parlously difficult to make this man angry. A real hard worker and equally confident when it comes to acads and a RAPIST when it comes to exams. I have never seen him dejected after exams, a proof that all of them have gone well for him. A man with who walks eats and sleeps his books, watches very few movies and listens to fewer songs. I truly enjoyed the times spent with you and you shall always remain my motivation when it comes to acads. Have a great life and illustrious career ahead. Farewell!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>Abishek is one those smart people on campus who will remain silent during the course of the semester and still manage to rock the exams and get superlative grades :P I have known him since sem1 and it has been a roller-coaster ride ever since. We always have fun when we meet up which has become a rarity these days. His humility and humor are something people need to appreciate. I know for a fact that he is going to have a great future :) Enjoy & Keep smiling. I'm going to miss your goofy smile :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Rambo, simple person, very hard working, and very strong. He plays good football and is a very diligent student. He helps everyone a lot.
He keeps quiet for a major part of his day. Hours might pass away when u keep talking and rambo keeps listening without saying a word. He never shows off and is a good friend.

Hope you achieve all your dreams.....all the best...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>
<p>Ramu..( I don remember who gave you that nick)......Where to begin?......I think u were the first person I came to know in BITS (i guess during the registration in CC) .Its been wonderful 3 years since then with you .....A  very hard working and sincere guy (I mean who can go  to Mane's classes and sit in the front bench and come to hostel and proclaim that he is a good teacher?...Only Ramu...). U were my lab partner in Analog .. and I will always remember the statement u made in every lab for me :" Abe...kuch toh kaam kar liya kar...bas aake baith jaata hai...." :D :D ....U r second love interest is NFS..(I have seen you playing  only in Lax's room)..And then top gear...(I guess u must have seen each and every episode..).. All the best for future..and hopefully u get teachers like Mane if u go to higher studies... :D :D ....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>Rambo or Ramgopal(Verma)! Both mean the same in context! :P 
He cracks some deadly jokes at times which have the effect of the above nicks on people!
He's what I'd call as a silent observer! Knows everything going on, in and around the campus. Comments only when (and where) required. Intelligent, gadget lover, simple, humble and insanely diligent! He loves gadgets and of course gets a new phone every now and then. We've had many a discussion on various things related to the campus, changing the grading system, fresh technology, getting projects and seeing ourselves somewhere big in the near future. Often hours pass by in front of the hostel entrance! :)
Avid leaner and listener! It has been great knowing you! 
You'll go a long way with your projects! All the best in all your future endeavors! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Abhishek a.k.a Ramu is a cool,simple and friendly guy. ...very enthusiastic about cars(spends a lot of time playing NFS in my room :P) and loves football .  A pro in academics and has helped me countless number of times with assignments.

Do keep in touch and have a great future ahead. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/laxman-sahoo">Laxman Sahoo</a></p>
