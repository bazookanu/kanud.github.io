<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Asati</h1><p>Nothing can be said after "BOSS". One of the coolest dude on the campus.It has been a privilege to stay with him in same corridor. His selections of songs \m/ and his birthday treat  in KFC was one of the best moments in my life.. that open truck with songs was simply \m/. Really helpful guy of mech ....no idea what he is doing in mech but one has to accept "BO$$" _/\_. Wish u a gr8 life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>Asati aka Bo$$ has been the truest of friends all these years. 
And though he kicks the hell out of people on their birthdays and creates a nuisance in the hostel all day long, Asati has been awesome to hang around with during all those moments! Hard-working, cool and supremely violent... You dont wanna mess with him in the mornings! When it comes to attending classes or tests, he's the person at the end of the line and still remains ridiculously optimistic about waking up early morning the very next day.. :P
Overall, a great friend who has been more like a brother to me \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-tiwari">Akshat Tiwari</a></p>
<p>He is my brother from another mother!! Don't remember how we met, but since we have met have always been good friends. Very good friend n too caring, but damn lazy!! Not advisable to have him as your lab partner if you are planing to make your partner work (thts y i chose pappu in place of you :P)

Fun loving, down to earth, and has somewhat low IQ (kidding :P) !! Spends most of his time thinking about girls and starring at them, but incase you ask him, he will say he doesn't have time for girls!! 

Total li8 banda, exam k ek din pehle kabhi syllabus shuru nahi karega.....kisi cheez ka tension nahi.......he lives his life to the fullest. He won't even know the full form of his courses till t2 is over!! 

Talking about his future, he is too ideal for working in any government job :P

You may think, all I am saying is bad about him, but I love him for all this. Asati you are a real bro, and from my heart, really enjoy your company, n you will be always missed!!

<p>Asati aka Bo$$ aka cool_dude :) One of BB member \m/ . He is like a brother to me (though i never let him know this ) . Whenever I need anything or want to have fun or tp , i go directly to his room. He is truly a genuine person , who will help you whatever the situation is. I know him since 1st year and had some amazing trips , outings with him . He is really a *dude* :o) . Its very rare to find some-one like you in this world and  I am fortunate to meet you. We became friends during workshop in 1-2 and since then this friendship has been growing.  Words cant describe our friendship though ( or I am bad at writing testis maybe ) , but you are a very special friend to me. Just be the way you are , dont change for any one ( especially girl ) . And I am sure you will meet the girl of *your type*  very soon :D . All the best for future . Be in touch . We will have many more trips with more chudaap in future for sure :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swapnil-saurav">Swapnil Saurav</a></p>
<p>It was only in 3-2 that I got to know Asati. All this while through his rants and generalizations, Asati brings a calmness to a conversation that is extremely rare. Despite not spending an enormous amount of time, the time between us has been enriching in every sense. His understated ways of *ignoring* the useless things are hilarious. His passion for cricket is much fabled and our Current Affairs class thoroughly savours the moments with a degree of poignancy. 
Hope we stay in touch, man. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amrit-pal">Amrit Pal</a></p>
<p>I began to know this guy properly only from 3-1. But since then he had been a very good friend of mime. Always ready to help, fun loving and a total entertainer. I will always remeber the memories of doing our project( Credits to shobith) and the chudaap we did when he was working his ass out. He tried his level best to teach me hindi but failed miserably..:P.When he is there conversations will always be lively. I will surely miss him after college but will always be in touch for sure..All the best b***h..)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>Asati..! my wannabe bro :P This guy is one of the coolest friends I’ve made. He always has a good time and makes sure that people around him also enjoy life. I’ve known him only since 1 year but feels like we’re friends from childhood..! ? Asati is a very down to earth, chilled and a very modest guy. Also he’s smart n sexy..! He’s obviously damn funny. We’ve had some great experiences together in this short time that we’ve known each other. The experience at Doodhsagar shall forever remain in our memories. I really look forward to the one year we have with each other. Tu main aur rupani…full masti karenge.. \m/. I know that you’ll succeed in whatever you put your heart in. Best of luck n stay in touch bro..!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-krishna-kant">R Krishna Kant</a></p>
<p>Asati...My encounters with him are full of energy. He greets first with a sarcastic comment and then "harsh bhai, majak kar raha tha". i love chatting with him, and I find him dependable. He is obsessed with his "khoolness":P (look at his picture here !!!) He is understanding and has really big- big plans for future. I wish he will have all of them.
