<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Bharadwaj</h1><p>Teddy! thats wat we call him coz of the kinda personality he had in 2009 when we joined the college. After some major changes and improvements in his life( :P), his personality gradually changed to a stud he is today, but his name continued to be the same....
So, Teddy the overgrown baby of our group :D is a really good person at heart. He is really innocent to worldly matters. But, as far as studies are concerned, he is a phodu or rather core-phodu. I like his seriousness and dedication towards studies from the beginning. We have studied together and burned the night fuel before exams for all the same courses. We even got same cgpa and same grades in the first 3 sems. :P 
To describe him in a few words, i will say he is seriously hard-working, dedicated, caring, honest, very calm, patient(made him wait in sun for 3 hrs at Bareilly bus station :P), true friend. 
I wish him good luck in life and I know he will certainly rock wherever he will work. May you get everything you wish for. Be as you are! Cheers! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-agha">AKSHAT AGHA</a></p>
<p>lively, studious, jolly, hard-working, fun-to-be-with, dedicated, passionate and ever so full of energy, that's Teddy for you in a nutshell! My sidey for 3 years, but was very rarely found in his room as he had shifted his base to the institute library after the first sem. He is a person to look up to when he slogs for an assignment or a project or anything which interests him(that being studies most of the times, i don't know why). I have rarely seen someone put in that amount of hard work with so much enthusiasm. This must have been a reason in part for his being a consistent performer in acads here at BITS, topping innumerous courses getting A's in others and also very few of the people around know that he missed being the ICSE board topper by just 4 marks! yes he was the 2nd ranker all over India in ICSE, ya i know it takes time to settle down. :) it happened to me too.. when i realised that i was living next to an fucking board topper! :P :D But he is one such down to earth person that he won't ever give you a hint of his greatness leave aside bragging about it. Had it been for anyone else with so many credentials, i dont know on which cloud that person would have remained all the time.. but this guy here is ever so cool and never asserts anything like that. A quality to seriously admire.
All that said and done, teddy becomes a different person altogether when he is not studying. He just loves to travel and go out and has seen more places in goa more number of times than anyone else in our group. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>
<p>And yes, be the way you are, you are sure to go places, i m tellin' ya. ;) All the very best for the life ahead! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>
<p>Being the person closest to him for the past three years,its rather a lot of information to put into the constraints of this testimonial if I start describing Teddy.He is someone who is very true,hardworking and blah blah.. {all good adjectives please ;-) }But there are a few unique things abt him which I would like to highlight.... He has wonderful quality of seeing the goodness in everyone.In all these years,I have never heard him criticize any single person.Its unbelievable ,but true.Even when I would start criticizing someone, he would calm me down and made me see the better side of that person. He is very dedicated to the work he undertakes.He was the project leader of a project under Nirmaan called UNNATi which involved teaching the kids at a school in Zari.Right from conceiving all the ideas,guiding his juniors working on the same project,doing the groundwork,giving the project its name etc. his commitment to the project is ineffable.And all this he does selflessly,because he feels for the cause.Moreover he was the co-ordinator for the Career Development Cell.He did all such work while handling the dreaded Comp Sci CDCs of 3rd year! His time management skills are commendable. He always helps people out.Anyone coming to him for help of any sort will never go back empty handed. He has a zest for life and despite the fair share of sorrows that he has, he doesn't let his near and dear ones be affected by that.... He is great movie connoisseur.. he not only watches movies for fun,he judges and analyzes them thoroughly very much like a film critic!!There is hardly any movie which he hasn't seen or reviewed.. With a love for food and a high regard for values,he is one gem of a person. A perfect mind reader!He knows how to respect people's feelings and emotions.He always stands for his convictions and doesn't harbor any vices like drinking or smoking.Yet he just knows how enjoy life... May your life's path be strewn with happiness "I will be there for you,when the rain starts to pour... I will there for you,like I hav been there before...I will be there for you,cause you are there for me too"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>He is one of my very good friends, we call him teddy because when we found/discovered him in BITS he was as cute as teddy bear but now he is a  grown up family man and he has his priorities clear. One of his very good qualities is that he never brags about himself for instance he was the second board topper of his board but he never told us unless he was asked. And we know bad habits are not easy to get rid of. He is hallucinating from past 3 years thinking, that he is still in 10 +2 and worse scoring marks also, making our (sober beings who knew that we are in engg college) life miserable. Jokes apart he has a very good heart and a positive attitude towards life. I am sure we will always remain friends for the rest of our life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-pathak">HARSHIT PATHAK</a></p>
<p>Got to know him only in my 3rd year through nirmaan... This short period was enough to say about his sincerity and commitment towards work..He 

has a great passion to teach kids.. He was the leader of a newly formed project in Nirmaan.. The project got its name("Unnati") and took  a great 

shape under his leadership, thanks to his systematic planning and scheduling which was practical enough to be implemented! All in all, it was 

great to have you as Unnati's first leader.. Your contribution to the project shall never be forgotten... All the very best for your future and 

continue to be the same leader everywhere you go :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
