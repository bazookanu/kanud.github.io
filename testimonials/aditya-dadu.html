<p>Daduuuuuuuu is one unique guy. I have never heard any single negative thing from him in the past 3 years and that is no ordinary feat. He sees the brighter side of every situation and enjoys it rather than other people, who get disappointed by the negative side and lose hope. He even praises the mess food (:P) and leaves the plate spick and span. An awesome speaker, badminton player and has a very charming personality. He is very light and cool-minded, never takes tension and won’t let you also take tension and never boasts about his strong background. It is a honour being your friend Dadu and I wish you all the best for your future life. Hope you become the CEO soon :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Dadu! The biggest HARAMI on campus and that too by a margin!  This guy can talk you into doing any thing _/\_ .  One of my best frnz i have had in my life. Has this weird obsession with the campus DOGS.(knws evry single minute details about them all from their venue to meet to time), still have no idea how did you manage this feat.   Amazing guy cant EVER stick to one decision made. The laziest of all, and is physically incapable of reaching any place on time or even within half an hour of the decided time. Our amazing trips together to mumbai, mahabaleshwar,"the Trip of Life" and now one more to come. A very humble down to earth guy with an unimaginable genuine soul. Dadu == \m/. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranay-agrawal">Pranay Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Dadu is a politician in a true sense, no sense of time or urgency. 10 mins of a common man = 2 hrs of dadu. He has good people skills. He's a good at managing people as well as work. 'Dadu bada aadmi hai' thats wat ppl call him. He's a true entrepreneur. Maze marne mein no compromise. He's good to have him as a friend. All the very best to him in future. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>"Dadu" was one of the first and best friends i made in the campus.. a very kind person at heart and very confused too :P  he is one of a kind... exceptional badminton player.... the one thing he does the best is sleep in the class ;) ... is very down to earth and cares about everyone... the one guy who respects all the faculty on campus, and never says anything negative to anyone...  haven't seen him angry in these 3 years (don't know when the bubble will burst :P ) ... is the most calm and composed guy i have ever seen... hope you remain the same... wishing you all the success for the future and always remain in touch!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>The brand ambassador of a well know dadu n sons oil company. Does great marketing of his product by saying "Tel lele". A sleeping beauty, can fit in anywhere and anyplace. Be it a small box or a yacht.. The attends classes, take down notes, sleeps in between, wakes up and again start writing from the next line.. A great person and your diplomatic attitude will take you well ahead in life. Its always been fun to hangout with you. May you succeed in life. Best of luck !! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>There are very few people whom u can look up to when u are in a spot of bother and dadu is invariably one among them. This man has an answer and a solution for literally everything (or at least he makes you believe that he has :P which still is damn comforting!) One of the most grounded persons I've ever met! Not even once does he make you realize that one day he is going to be an heir of a multi crore company!!!! His simplicity is his asset. Sports is not something you'd  relate  to when you at look at this guy's physic but watch him play on that badminton court once and all your pre-conceptions will bite the dust! But most importantly this guy can indulge you and convince you into doing anything. IT WAS YOU WHO CONVINCED ME TO ASK HER OUT!!!!!! (Those discussions in your room :P). It was because of you that my vocabulary got richer by 3 words namely   "tel le le ", "ghantu ke" and "ongal" :P. In so many ways dadu you have been the one who has kept our group in tact and continue to do so :) to sum you up in few words you are our "Mr. Dependable"!!!!!!!Having called you that you are now obliged to lend me your EEE notes next year :P 
Wish u all the best!! Btw  senti aur emotional part agle saal ke end ke liye bacha ke rakha hai :)

<p>Aditya Dadu! There’s sooooooo much to say, and so little time <sigh> but here goes --> 
I had put in my name for the badminton mixed doubles in my first year. Little did I know that the person I would be randomly paired with for the event would go on to become such a special being for me. You hardly spoke. You just smiled, and what a smile it was - million dollars worth, indeed.  Aditya is one of the most genuine persons there can be on this planet. True to his nature, he is caring, sweet, smart, fun and a bundle of pure joy. You are someone from whom I have always always got positive vibes. You have the ability to stay calm and composed in all situations and never let the tension of the situation get to you. I really admire you for that. He plays phenomenal badminton, with between-the-legs shots and all <applause>. He is so swift and fluid when he plays that sport. He has amazing convincing abilities! Talks me into anything, boosts my confidence to high levels, keeps me calm in times of trouble, and gets me out of the stickiest situations! Dadu is always there in times of need! Mr. Dependable, indeed :) :) :)
I think that Aditya has a very sweet smile that can just make one’s heart melt. This gem of a person respects every other living thing on Earth. I have never heard him bad-mouth about anyone, nor have I ever heard anyone speak a word against him. He is a man of high calibre. He has a heart of gold and I respect him for that. Dadu is a very simple, calm, composed and humble guy. He is very kind and giving in nature. A true well wisher and always hopes for the best. His humility is something that I have never seen before. I look up to you in many aspects and really admire you for so many things that can possibly be –a really evolved being in many ways possible.
Daduuuuuuuu, you are so addictive and your vibes are infectious. Your positive energy has that amazing ability to spread through others. You have the ability to simply make the world so much more happier just by your presence! You emanate that joy and bliss like no one I know!
“When I am so down,
and feeling so blue;
What makes me light up,
Is Aditya Dadu! “ :)
Aditya is a real gem of a person and I know that you shall go on to do immensely great things in life. Sky is not the limit for you! I believe that you will go on to achieve great heights in life and fulfil every desire of yours. May God bless you with all the joy, happiness, bliss and glee that he can possibly shower! Stay just the way you are and never ever change whatever happens in life!
You are and shall always be most special, indeed.  :) :) :) :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/namrata-nadkarni">Namrata Nadkarni</a></p>
<p>This guy can talk you into ANYTHING !
I'll definitely miss those stereotype Dadu lines viz. "tel...",  "tel le le" and "ghantuke". 
He's good at almost all sports! Rarely lets anger get him, must have been kept on an ice clad surface for days after being born, though it's quite easy to frustate/irritate him. There are like a dozen good qualities in him which can be rarely found clubbed together in a single person. Humility, respect for every thing living/dead, his 24*7 calm & composed nature, always positive, simple, and yeah, "Socu Bhaiya !", how can i forget that ! :D
Keep in Touch Dadu =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yash-patodia">Yash Patodia</a></p>
<p>Dadu can manipulate anyone to better people. He is very determined and focused on the task in hand and never rests until it is completed. He can bring out people's deepest secrets very easily (i don't know how he does it but he does it very well). He is also hilarious and makes the mood light around him during the lab sessions. He is blessed with great oratory skills and charisma. He can befriend anyone very easily. He will achieve success in future and i wish a long and happy life. All the best!!

<p>Sirjee, What can I say. Aap pro ho. Be it logon ko ghumana, nautanki maarna ya padhna. You know it all. A humble, friendly, happy-go-lucky and down-to-earth guy but far more politically inclined than people understand :P
A simple person with a ever helpful and lite attitude makes him a wonderful company. And you should seriously consider getting all your notes published, they are far too comprehensive. He has also helped me through some tight situations. Thanks a ton for that. Our fathers have been batch-mates, and now we too :)
Hope you have a bright future and a great life ahead. 
All the Best :)

<p>Ooops, sabne sab kuch bol diya!! i am late. But i too have many things to say. You wont realise how it feels when you wake up at 10 am and you dont have toothpaste. Not because you dont have, but because one lazy person doesnt bothers to buy one for himself. Because of you, i have to go and stand in washroom and wait for someone to turn up with toothpaste and then beg to him. But I have your Deodorant, face wash bhi tha, abhi dikh nahi raha hai. Tera wireless mouse mere room se koi lekar bhaag gaya. And Namrata should thank me for my playing with his phone, i dont think dadu will show any emotion. I dont expect from toothpaste thief. (P.S. For, all other relevant "down to earth", "opinion at every matter"  characteristics of dadu, please refer to Ishan's post)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshvardhan">Harshvardhan</a></p>

<p>Dadu bahut kamina aur bahut bada waala hai! . Ek number ka politician hai joh din bhar netagiri karta rehta hai . As everyone has said before me, he can talk u into nething! i mean nething. Always cool , composed,calm , patient (_/\_ patience he has), "soft-spoken (this came  from a faculty)" ready to help, blah-bakar........i didnt know him in 1-1, just heard that there was a eeessshhhhhtttuuudddd "Dadu" on 2nd floor , jiske room par jaakar sab  padhte hain. Came to know him really well in 2nd year ..plays every sports whether he knows it or not, a great badminton player .... great guy to hangout with , will talk any and all important and nonsense crap ( which are funny actually :D ) and try his level best to make u believe it. @ labs saath mein hum dono ne bahut maze liye hain ;) ;) .Acads mein he is total phodu , my dev bio and physio ke grades ka poora shrey dadu ko jaata hai ( dont know wat i wud have done widout those notes which  i asked u to give me before u go to dinner 1 night  before exam). Punctuality is dadu's specialty _/\__/\__/\__/\_. if i start speaking abt it then  u will see only ^&%^&^*&^*^*%&$@$#@^ in his testimonial. his relationship advices toh aur bhi \m/ hoti hain!! : LOL !!.. Had many many , infinite trips with him in which  i enjoyed a lot...(self drives were just way to awesome man!!). Overall he is a very very very very good person at heart . he cant think nething -ve about nething ( however crappy it is) . Just "once" in 3 years i have seen him that he is about to curse some1 .
He is one of my best friend and i hope we remain so for future... All the best for ur bright future!! 

P.S Next year EEE ke CDCs tum hi padha rahe ho!!!

<p>Our conversation begins with "Sirji" :P. Dadu is a warm, friendly,jovial,pure hearted and a wonderful friend. It was fun to have him in same group during labs. Our SOP (in which we hardly met our instructor, and finally did some jugaad to complete the project), the time we spent in writing the reports, lab hours, the hangouts are all cherishable moments. He takes simplicity to a all new level. The best thing about him is that  he never complains for anything be it mess food. I wont forget those "I knock u speak" moments outside the teacher's chamber. I would remember the times we wrote report together especially the one during which something went wrong with our mobile phone display when we received a call from a person :P (We know who the person was) :D :P. He is a pro badminton player and a good sports person. It was indeed a great time with you. Have a gr8 life ahead. Farewell :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
