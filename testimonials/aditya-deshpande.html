So, describing him is beyond my limits....Just a standing OVATION! Hatts Off!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>Good things come is small packages, better ones come in smaller.A calm demeanor,a generous heart,an infecting smile and an eagerness to know and do everything are some of the thing that come in that package.Worldly objects and events have no importance for him and praises for that brain of his really have no end.But more than anything a friend to cherish for a lifetime.Kudos!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritesh-ranjan">Ritesh Ranjan</a></p>
<p>A calm, smiling genius, a genius with electronic gadgets. Aditya Deshpande.
I had the pleasure of working with this genius at SKF, PS1. Extremely modest, soft spoken, nothing ever deters him.Something doesnt work, he tries another approach-simply no stopping him! All the best Adi Bhai!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>

All the best to you mate, we all know that you will just be great in everything you do if you enjoy doing it. So just go ahead and be what you are. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>I came to know Aditya through our PS at SKF. He is such a genius yet so soft spoken and down to earth. He has such a calm demeanour that I am always left amazed. I remember how he didnâ€™t crib even a bit at the unfairness of the project allotted to him or PS mid-sem grades. Although a bit reserved at first he is someone you can have a quality discussion with and is one of the guys I highly respect. All the best for the future! I am sure you will do great :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>A fellow EEE survivor, he has a sharp, intelligent mind and a calm countenance that is highly reassuring. Working side by side with him as lab partners and classmates, he's been a great colleague and friend throughout. I wish him success in all his endeavours and best of luck for his future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>One of the truly dedicated EEE guys in the campus. Your understanding of concepts is unbeatable.  "Genius" is the word to describe you in one word. EMEC labs would have been very boring without your company.  Yeah!! we have many memories of EMEC labs !!! It was fun to be with you always. I wish you all the best for your future...  Be in touch... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>

He's very dedicated in all that he does and is open to new ideas and opportunities... he will never say no to a request for help.
Wish you best of luck for your future endeavors. Have a great life ahead...!!!

<p>I thought an Ideal human being(or an Ideal student) was a mythical concept or a figure only to be found in Essay books and exam papers until I met Aditya.The epitome of genius,hard work,dedication ,sincerity, meticulousness .... (I could fill a whole book). A very soft spoken guy  and always ready to help to needy people (Meaning of Need= Stationary,food,syllabus,Conceptual  doubts... and again I could  fill a whole book .... I owe half of my marks to this guy). The GOD of electronics and WSN .A passionate foodie.Slightly Introverted (Known for his monosyllabic replies :D  ). A very down to earth fellow ( literally.. :D). You are a very dear friend  of mine and thank you for bearing me and my ridiculous (rather..highly inquisitive) questions.I would wish you a lifetime of happiness and success. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>A great man with a great brain, great virtues and of course a cute face :D. A pinnacle of patience and a god of sorts. All said, its astonishing how modest, soft spoken and down-to-earth Aditya is. Your tranquillus way of life, super-human intellect, targeted approach and pure and infectious smile are simply adorable. The ideal student, teachers' pet, a great son of proud parents and above all a great friend. I see a bright and illustrious career ahead of you. Wish you all success and happiness in your life and I'm sure your legacy will continue to inspire the students (and faculty :P) of this campus for generations to come. Farewell, keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>One of the most helpful friends ever.. he has helped me a lot in studies and solving assignments. Even if I knock his door the night before exams, he would greet me with his priceless smile only to clear my annoying doubts. He was the best lab partner I could ever find and I owe most of my marks to him. A friend having common interests, we both enjoy watching topgear, reading about electronic gadgets and eating pizzas. A small guy with a heart bigger than ever.... I really enjoyed your company and the quality time I spent with you. Wish you all the best!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>my MT-2 partner, thats when i came to know "Mr. Little Master .."  A self-effacing and unpresuming fellow he is and helped steer my way through Electronics . As rightly said Great things always come in small packages !!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-trehan">Sahil Trehan</a></p>
<p>Great surprises come in small packages... I guess only two people live upto this line, one is my personal fav Sachin Tendulkar and second is you. You're the cutie pie amongst the boys. You're extremely innocent and exceptionally helpful. Despite being so intelligent, you're really down to earth and willing to help even 10 mins before the exam, this is what separates you from the rest of the Nerds. If you need any professional advice then this guy is for you.. I don't understand where do you store such a large amount of knowledge. You've standards that everyone, esp me, wish to achieve one day. Lastly, you're among those few students who enjoy EEE ( Really !!! ), Respect for that..
Keep going strong, have a great life. Wish you good luck for all your future endeavors...!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>This little package may look harmless and innocent as hell, but looks are deceptive. He's quite capable of conjuring up some manic monster "Decepticon" Transformer.Thankfully he won't. This guy is the Steve Wozniac of our batch . It isn't uncommon to find him lost in a pile of manuals, breadboards and web of wires hacking away at some HDL or the like. Sheer genius and wizkid at it . I will forever be in  debt to him for rescuing me from the jaws of demanding ENI courses with not even the slightest restraint. Don't be surprised if you find this guy in some hardware lab in Santa Clara or Cupertino. As a guy he is a sweetheart , unassuming polite and just so nice to talk to that he makes me feel like a douche. The fact that you will make it HUGE and end up on the cover or electronics today as the next big thing is beyond doubt, all I can hope for is one day I have the honour of working with you. KUDOS to you and please, please do stay in touch ! Cheers !!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhananjay-deepak-sathe">Dhananjay Deepak Sathe</a></p>

U wer d person who once used to be my watch<yeah seriously> , he was once d most punctual ( i dont know about today, no he's NOT ), sharp on time, who used to wake me up daily in 2nd sem (dont remember xactly ), he knows what to do when...
He's d only person i know, who's doin' engineering with the  utmost honesty... he's not concerned about marks,  missin' d surprise quiz on monday mornin' n still gettin' an 'A', ( may b, many can do it ), but to do it in d 4 back to back semesters, only he has d talent :P
i think u r better than most of d silicon valley's pros <thats d best i know> 
he's also hilarious( u got to know him better ) , he's lazy , he's d most patient n gentle soft-spoken n a kind-hearted person, yeah he's childish n yet mature at d same time( u know ), he's also d kamina(yes HE is, u better know him...:P #sarcastic), he has his own interests too, he's d genius,

he's d person who never thinks b4 helpin' nebdy ,(remember u gave all mine physics quizes in MT-1 , who wud do that in bits, tell me man!!! even if u got less than me :D)

<p>Aditya Deshpande - God of AC/DC | L-EEE-GENDARY.

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough" - Albert Einstein. This is so true for this guy. He explains the concepts with such simplicity that you wonder how could you not understand it earlier. He is a genius, a electonics/automobiles/jet_fighters enthusiast. I have never met a person more soft-spoken and innocent looking than this guy. He is so down-to-earth that infact he is down-to-crust.through,the.core.on.the.other.side.of.the-earth. Its hard to meet a guy who is so sincere, friendly, polite, amiable, helpful, magnanimous, benevolent, gracious, patient, prodigious, with firm convictions. Believe me, a whole dictionary worth of adjectives could be dedicated to him. I remember the first time I met him (in the first week of coll.); in the common room where he was sitting alone watching something on TV; probably the only time he has been in common room except for playing TT. Although, for all his virtues, he is a li'l introvert, and he too tends to have that knack of cracking a couple of highly intellectual yet pathetic jokes commonly known as sastas :P. Oh and he is also a pro player of HAWX, try and beat him in that or TT; well try and beat him in anything for that matter. 
<p><p>
Here's a toast to the semesters spent in front of your room at the beloved adda, to all the times you patiently cleared my doubts, to that bob-the-builder tower, to all the awesome moments past three years. You are one gem of a friend.  Wish you all the luck in future (though, you don't need it). Stay in touch :).

<p>Aditya is very down to earth, intelligent, calm and nice person. He was in my MT2 electronics group and we never had to bother about the experiment as he used to take care of it completely. He knows all the concepts very clearly. The way he used to explain sometimes before viva, I am sure I would have known ES better if he taught it... Needless to tell he is a pro in acads.. Good luck for your future! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
