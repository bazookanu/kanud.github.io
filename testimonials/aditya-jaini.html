<p>In life you make many friends, but only few of them are worth remembering because they are the real friends and Aditya Jaini is one of those few people I call real friends :) He is a one of the few people you can trust, tell him anything you want and expect help and support whenever you need it. He is always ready to help you! He is a great teammate. This I realized as we worked for CIMA GBC. This is the person who takes pains to complete what is left incomplete and even if he is left totally uncharged at 4am in the morning with 3-4 previous sleepless nights, he would still keep on going. Hats off to you man! :) May you have a great successful future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>

<p>Aditya Jaini is the "God" of our Eco batch. Ever smiling, he is a teacher's perfect student, whether its attending ALL classes or topping academics. I got to know him well from 2-1 onwards when we used to attend V.K. Singh's class together. He has had that uncanny luck with getting terrible teachers. Yet he rarely complains about them and goes about on his job of staying prepared in that subject and topping it. You can always rely on him to clear your doubts. Ever helpful, he is a true friend of mine. Wishing you the best Aditya, you will go a long way ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>

he is also a perfectionist...wants everything as it should be...will stay up whole night to complete work even if others take li8 ( remember CIMA report submission!! :) )..
he usually has a smiling face...but when he is angry...he is REALLY angry...!

<p>Jaini! He is one of the most sincere people I happen to know. Very calm and composed he has a sharp mind that can challenge even the 'wonderful' thoughts of Dr. Debasis Patnaik :D
I always wondered how he got that intuitive thinking in EGP! :P
This boy is a very helpful being and has always been a boon in times of doubts and queries. Aditya is one of the most diligent people I know and his calm and composed nature shall take him to great heights. His smile is very infectious and make the 'saamne wala' smile along :)
I had great fun knowing this guy and shall do the same for years to come! All the very best for everything you do in life, Aditya!

<p>Janiniiiiiiiiiiiii!! The Eco Stud. Eco girls die to talk to him so that he can help them solve their last moment doubts and help them score top marks :D :D Jokes apart, this guy epitomizes hard-work, studying and studying and studying till the course syllabus is over. I met him during our CP2 labs. I used to doze off in the lab while he used to furiously code :P Often i copied his code and got marks. Having him in economics class was a boon for me. He attended each and every class and wrote each and every word from the teachers mouth (and became their favourite too :P) His sincerity amazes me and I really look a t him as my idol..... if I had even an ounce of the amount of sincerity he has....... Anyways, he has been an amazing friend of mine, knowing you was a pleasure :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>What do I say that has not already been said about ADI . My first and most important friend at BITS. Our friendship goes way back to our first day on campus . I am sure life would not have been so much fun at BITS had i not met him . Of course, the most devoted and dedicated person i have ever seen. A competitor at heart , he strives hard to perform at whatever opportunity life throws at him. Unpredictable , never afraid to try something new. An exceptional friend , always there for help whenever you need him . It has been a pleasure being his neighbor and friend for 3 years . Gonna miss him the most........... Hopefully, we stay in touch always . Wish you the best-est of luck for your future . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijat-chowdhary">Abhijat Chowdhary</a></p>
