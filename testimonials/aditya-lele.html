<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Lele</h1><p>i can think of only one word for you- DEVOTED.. be it music, coding or waking up corridor people (though sometimes you failed at it :D). Can't think of a better person for a sensible company. And,of course mentioning ice n spice is a must..always had an amazing time there. I think we should give a couple more visits there before the semester ends ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>One of the best keyboardists on campus. He has been a really great friend and a true leader. Apart from his music skills, he is really fast in grasping things. He is great with computers and not only that, he researches and keeps information about many other topics that interest him ranging from electronics, robotics to maths and physics. A true geek and an awesome guy to spend time with. Best of luck for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>There are "Jacks of all trades" and "Masters of One". Aditya stands out as "Master of all". A complete music-buff, he can deftly play a plethora of musical instruments and write astronomically complex codes at the same time. Became an instant fan after watching his fingers sprint like a gazelle on the piano-keyboard making it look so plain simple. Taught me a lot about playing the keyboard. Will always remember him for dexterity at whatever he does and his unique non-chalance. Hope that we Lucknow buddies stick around as friends forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Aditya Lele.. or Lele as I call him is the epitome of modesty. Musicians as good as him, there might be many (actually no, there aren't ).. but none so modest and humble. A very sincere, intelligent, hardworking and down-to-earth guy who made a dull course like MT2 rather interesting for me. The way he goes about executing things with perfect planned order and not complaining even once, no matter how unfair the system has been to him, makes you feel that he's got big things in store for his future. I cannot do justice in words to the feeling you get when you listen to him play a Yanni on that keyboard .. His views on almost any issue reflect his simple uncomplicated approach to the life. One of my best buddies trustworthy friends in this place I hope we'll always continue to be in touch. Wish you all the luck and I hope you'll be successful in every endeavour of your life.

<p>Adi is one of the most amazing friends anyone can have!! Anything said about his love for music is a modesty. I still remember the jam sessions we had at ice and spice!! :D..In case there is some sanity left in our 'pariwaar', the credit goes to you :P. In case i start penning down things you love and are good at, the list is just endless!!..You remember the origami cube you gave me on B'day which turned into a rose....omg!!!...There are way too many memories since the beginning and you have been a part of each and everyone of them!!..(all of them can't just be mentioned :D)...And obviously we will stay in touch( such cliches man :P)!!....Take care...and Rock On \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>Adi has been one of my closest friends since the very beginning of my Bits life. We have shared some awesome times with each other and the already mentioned 'pariwaar' :P .He is an enthusiastic learner,keen on knowing everything about everything. He is multifaceted, superbly talented and an amazingly good friend. He has deep insights about a lot of things but is also surprisingly innocent when it comes to some matters! Stop trying to find logic everywhere :P. He cares a lot for everyone of his friends and puts in a lot of thought in every little thing he does :) Needless to say, he is always going to be one of my closest friends.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>
<p>The fact that Lele is very good at whatever he does, and is still absolutely down-to-earth and as cool as a cucumber, sets him apart from the rest of the crowd. A brilliant musician, his fingers on the keys has many a times left us with our jaws dropped. And this i completely believe, by experience of 3 years, - if anything is wrong with your laptop, Lele knows how to fix it. Whatever little times we spent together (during/after practices) were quite entertaining with his own unique brand of humour.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jayant-dalmia">Jayant Dalmia</a></p>
<p>Talented, Soft spoken, devoted, friendly, modest and calm. He's one person with whom you can actually have a conversation. Apart from when he is not playing all kinds of instruments, watches animes with those big headphones wrapped around :P 
Though I don't know him too much, but enough to say that he will make it big. 
May you go and do what you want :) All the Best. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>THERE IS A REASON WHY I AM WRITING THIS IN CAPS LOCK. LELE MASTER ZINDABAD. MAST BANDA HAI. HAR DUSRI BANDI KO CHEDTA HAI. SAI MUTHHU AUR ISKO PAKANE MEIN JITNA MAJA AAYA AUR KISI KO PAKANE MEIN NAHIN AAYA. MUTTHU KO BOL 'AAMI HIBO BONSHI' IS NOT BENGALI. BY THE WAY TU PRO BANDA HAI YEH BAKI LOGO NE BATA DIYA. 

FOR THE RECORD I DO NOT SHOUT WHEN TALKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>The first word that comes to my mind when I think about this guy is "FRIEND" because he is one of the rare true ones that you would ever find.You ask anything from him just once and even if ur just kidding he would care enough to remember it and get it for you.A very individualistic and different personality, he is one guy whose range of interests varies from A to Z.An amazing musician he has made many of our evenings special with his musical talent.I am not writing a long testimonial here because all I want to do is say a thanks for always caring so much.Hoping we land up in Bangalore together but till then have fun!! All the best!! Would miss u a lot!!! :) :)   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>

<p>Adix Lunar- my sidey for the past 3 years,its been a rare and delightful experience.He is no doubt one of the most talented guys on this campus.A cool geek and a wonderful musician,we both had that love for music and keyboards.He introduced me to Yanni and since then,we have covered a good number of songs, be it in the music nites or our simple jam sessions.A very helpful guy and a down to earth person,he has conquered almost all that Bits life is supposed to offer. His computer skills is just astonishing and I owe my CP1 and CP2 grades to him(:P). You have a bright future ahead,no doubt. All the best and do keep in touch .Making music together one day definitely not out of the options :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>

<p>Aditya Lele. One of the most brilliant and talented fellows I've ever met. Sophisticated, soft-spoken, exceptionally intelligent and musically gifted. We made it through some tough times in our last sem, with all the stupid assignments and all. Still, its sad that we became friends only in our last sem. I wish you all the best man, for your PS and beyond. Hope that all of it works out for you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-raj-pant">Aditya Raj Pant</a></p>
