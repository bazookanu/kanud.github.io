<p>Well, when I first came here, Aditya was already pretty famous as the guy who gave up a slot in BJ Medical to be here. As I came to know him better, my respect only grew. This guy is just phenomenal... at everything! We had an awesome time studying together in our first semester (yeah he aced all the courses). Aditya is one of the most creative guys I've ever met. He's also the one who has visited Vasco the most number of times!
This isn't a goodbye at all, I just wanted to wish you all the best for whatever you do next!! (read MS :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>Oh, where do I begin?? I have never seen anyone live life to the fullest like Aditya does. Insanely funny and witty, his passion towards music is unending. I(or anyone else for that matter) have never seen him study, yet he seeks and destroys all exams. He lives and breathes his friends, for him, nothing else matters. He is and always will be a people's person.
As we turn another page of our lives,as we move on, no matter where we go,the fun we had will never be forgotten,the jokes we cracked, the name-calling, the daily trip to mongi, all these will always be remembered, the memory will remain forever. Ladies and gentleman, the One the only, Aditya Modak!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>Aditya - that guy who can make one smile in any situation just by speaking in Hindi :P. Great at Acads as well as other things like DoCW and Backstage. He also managed well as the VP for MM. Aditya it was great fun knowing you!! Dont forget : Live life King Size!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>By far one of the most talented and witty persons that I have ever met!! Great at acting, singing , mimicry,playing the synthesizer , guitar, the list just goes on....He is also the liveliest person that I have ever met. Not one second goes by when I am with him that I am not laughing!!! Always has some extremely hilarious stories of his school-days at his disposal to lighten the mood... The 'chai-waala' of our group , having mastered the art of carrying around 10 cups of tea at a time :) ( skills honed further at SKF ) .... Always willing to help without hesitation. Most of us have BITS as our second home, but this guy as 'Anantashram' as his third home as well!!!! ACADS-wise toh 'FODU' hain... Another talent of his is to come up with some pretty funny nick-names - 'Kalia Fernandis' ,'Spank-rocker Couple', 'Couple Dev :D :D' to name a few... In short, he is 'master of all trades' kind of a person . He will always be at your side to cheer you up whatever the mood.... Hats off to you!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>
<p>Modak is one of the funniest guys to hang out with. With his awesome mimicry skills he can send anyone to peals of laughter. Not only this, getting great grades also seem second nature to him. The long dreary hours working at PS1 in SKF during morning shifts became more bearable when he was around. I also attribute the little marathi i learnt during that time to him. Thank you Aditya Modak. You are awesome...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>An awesome guy who knows what he is doing at all times. What I like about him the most is his ability to find humor in almost everything. Workshop was definitely more entertaining for me because of him and I'm sure with such knowledge and positive attitude he'll go very far in life.
Enjoy! Keep Smiling.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Phenomenal is the word that aptly describes this guy. Even though I cannot say that I have spent a great amount of quality time with him, but at first meet itself he impressed with his crazy witty humour and the constant quintessential baby-smile on his face, not to mention his insanely high scores that followed in the subsequent examinations. I do not know someone as cheerful and fun to be around as this guy. He is a great mechanical engineer and is destined to do great things in the future and make us all proud.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>He is one of d most friendly and witty persons on d campus.I  am constantly amazed at his friendly, cheerful and helpful demeanor. The right side of AH3 wouldn't b the same without him. His Singru jokes are epic and njoyed by mech dudes everywhere. And best of all he is a metal head just lyk me. He is getting very gud at the drums and we have big plans to start out own Metallica tribute band!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nithin-s-poduval">Nithin S Poduval</a></p>
<p>A person who lives life to the fullest.Good at everything he does....from acads to pulling pranks (& also very creative). A very good mimic,a great actor and an awesome chatterbox ( remember we were caught by almost all the profs :P during lectures we shared ).Always willing to help everyone and always trying to put a smile on everyone's face.Always had a memorable time whenever he was around.Will miss our trips to ashram,mongi,lake and a-mess breakfast and also our non-stop bakwaas.
You are a brilliant mechanical engineer and an even more brilliant person.All the best for future and may you excel in whatever you choose to do."Jahaanpanah tussi great ho"

<p>Aditya is one of the most cheerful and friendly persons I have ever seen in my life. He is always fun to be around with his witty and funny jokes and comments.He always has some stories to share with his amazing mimicry. He has a great passion for music. I was amazed by his sense of rhythm while playing the drums which is unique. He learned to play the drums in a couple of days on his own! The days we worked together at SKF became memorable with his Datta Kamble jokes. The long journey's in the SKF bus would not have been fun without his jokes (especially Nikhil Kane). It was fun working along with him on "Malu's" project. He is a great mechanical engineer and knows anything you name. He excels in whatever he does. I wish him 'All the Best!' for the future. Remember: always keep the smile on your face alive! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>You talk about any skill and this guy has all the guts and all the brain and all what it requires to master it... A professional expert in everything,  a phenomenally clever person, one who has been blessed by one of those amazingly clever brains, and a sense of humour which will make any person on the planet burst out into laughter... A lover of old music... Probably one of those people on campus who knows any  damn song ( even those that were a super flop in the 1970s times) ... A person who can do substantially HUGE amount of work in substantially LESS amount of time... A true genius... An extremely passionate guy about machines... This guy is a multi-talented, brainy, and a very witty fellow... Able to crack jokes at any moment of time and make the rest of the people happy (rather forces them to be happy)....  An expert at mimicry and acting business.... Has it totally in him... You name a person and you are ready with a small mimic from him.... Also he is the person who can come up with any possible hilarious nick name for every possible thing...( The ones where in we put a "ya" at the end.. Like "warya", "abhya" (two of your profs) as well as some of them like "sakharpuda jodi" ,etc... )..  You never see him in a worry... An extremely happy person living life to the fullest.... An expert in everything as I would describe him... I believe that if all people in this world were blessed with such a brain, we would have really transformed it into one where there are real castles in the air... :)... You a big pro and a true genius dude... Keep it up.. !!!! Go on excelling in whatever that comes up at u... Glad to meet you in my journey of life... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>The Ultimate Mimic, Comedian, Prankster and  Best Buddy --this is what Aditya Modak is all about.  Aditya can mimic anyone he sees so precisely that it would be like looking at the person itself. Plus he sometimes adds some masala to make it very comedy. He is very fond of destructive pranks especially when it involves burning something or spilling water on someone or making some kind of trap for someone. He is a genius and gets awsm marks without much effort. You cannot be around him and not laugh. He has given really funny nicknames for every person on campus to the point that one would forget the real names. Once he had made some rocket out of a bottle which few to the ceiling of the room with a burst of fire.  Once we had poured water on some M.E. guys and still they only got the scoldings from our warden. Then it was common for him to throw stones at our windows in the middle of the night so that we would get up with a fright :-). Once he had interviewed a huge bouncer in Waves (look he's brave !!!! and i was rolling with laughter ). Once he tricked our hostel assistant (Tripathi >.< ) into pouring mud water on himself ( dont ask me how : he's a practical mechanical engineer :-) ) I can just go on and on but i'll stop (coz he has a sincere side also believe me or not!! ).  We were also together in PS1 where we continued the devilish acts in corporate world as well. But he also has some limiter in his mind which makes him work very elegantly and sincerely for the task he loves-- hence he completed an awsm project along with all the timepass stuff. Apart from being my partner in pranks he has also been my "PeTrOl" buddy (now dont ask what that means--OM _/\_ ). He was also an active member in DOCW and Backstage for the record ( But he would'v been very successful in Music, Dance, Fashion or MIME clubs as well : its just that he likes to choose his own audience :-P) .He is an excellent driver and enthusiastic about it ( just like me!!!!). All the best for the future !!!!!!  You will definitely be an inspiration for future generation of pranksters :-D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-gote">Paritosh Gote</a></p>
<p>Modak (shibu style) has gotta be one of the whackiest characters on campus. Freakishly smart without a caring for the world, was a great experience with him (especially in the labs taking chhatri's case). Love your attitude man, keep it up! *The Asli Marathi Manoos*
<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>....a comical and colourful character
he can make anyone and everyone feel comfortable with him..
Whenever we get together we have a great time with lots of laughter.     
His wonderful sense of humour, adventure and life experiences have given him the ability to see any situation in a positive way.
Wish you a amazing life ahead..... :)

<p>What do i say about aditya...he is smart, funny, and insanely crazy...he is the most bindaas person i have ever met....i mean he is capable of doing anything!!...be it sitting in the cockpit with the pilot...or accidently smacking a certain professor on his head!!...and he is also really good in almost everything he does (except his hindi....though he has improved a lot :P).But above all he is a really nice friend and a person...he never fails to surprise me and always makes me laugh....i hope that we remain good friends..(though i am never going to stop calling you 9 pointer!!)....have a great life!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-dighe">Priyanka Dighe</a></p>
<p>Yes. Its Modak. He is smart. He is funny. He is crazy. He is insane. We have all heard of that. And know it too. For me Modak, is an inspirer. When I get worked up with EEE and meet Modak down in the Hostel Corridor while going to the mess, I see him cracking jokes and making a few laughs. Thus, Modak inspires optimism in me. He awakens the inner child in each of us, and shows us how to gain joy from simple things in life. He has taught me how to laugh at life. He lives in the present. He is the one who lets life chase him, rather than him change life. I dont think we have much in common, but theres a reason why our conversations get so funny and interesting at the mess table. Modak is one person who can adapt almost to anyone and anything around him. Continue to be the way you are, and I assure, life will throw itself on you. Keep smiling, (and inspiring others to smile)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mrinmay-milind-kulkarni">Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Its very hard to give an introduction for a guy like modak, for a good reason indeed ;-)
He has so many qualities i hope i can remember them all at once...
1st of all best imitator of jim carrey (and many more actors)... he is a 9p, so very good in acads,
loves marathi movies/dramas/songs.... loved by all the ppl around him.... he has some unique opinion to say at every point in any discussion.... "Taxi's" fav student :P .... one of my best and earliest friends on campus
thanks a lot for all the memories from making taxi's (boring) class interesting to MM drama writing and wonderful acting!!!
Never change and you have all the best wishes for the rest of the life!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-deshpande">sahil deshpande</a></p>
<p>Oh well.. Aditya Modak - one name that will surely be remembered for a long time. Ever dynamic and funny. This guy can get you cracking at almost any time of the day. He is a brilliant mimic artist and has the best sense of humor ever! I cant remember how many times I have burst out into fits of laughter seeing him enact the nuances of daily life. Along with this, he has a really efficient brain as well! He is one of the topper of Mech Dept. Be it a stranger in BITS or a faculty - Aditya can start a pleasant conversation with almost anyone. As someone mentioned in one of the testimonial, he can get a smile on your face just by speaking in his popularly flawed hindi :D. He has a keen interest in music as well and has been perfecting his drumming skills of late.. I hope he becomes pro at it just like all the other things.. It was a pleasure to have you as a friend. I do hope we stay in touch and relive the mech jokes. Best of luck for the future ! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>Modak you are perhaps the most energetic person in the whole campus. A great comedian, mimic and above all, an awesome person to work with (you always lightened the mood during MM meetings and practices :D) You are unique in the sense that you can come up with witty jokes even in the most serious of situations. You are a person who values his friends and their friendship, no wonder I have seen you spending hours together in the mess just to chat with your friends. All in all, you are a bindass person and hope you remain the same for years to come. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>They say enjoy and study! and Modak is a perfect example of that. There was hardly any time that i saw him tensed or stressed. Always calm, smiling and trying out new things. The best thing about Modak is he does what he loves doing it. For instance on the first music night in the campus he saw someone playing the drums and loved it......and now modak can play too...he learnt it without anybody's help! and he is loving the guitar and playing it....that is what is chasing your passions all about. No class can be boring when you are with him in the same class...i still carry those memories of Maths-2,Chemistry-2 and now Journalism. The way he adds masala and mirch to every incident and tells his anecdote is a skill he only can master. Keep that smile on bro and all best for future :) Inertia!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>I have known Aditya since I was a kid and let me tell you, he is insanely smart and talented. The guy is a true genius and of the best engineers I have known. Apart from that he has a cracking sense of humour and definitely has an alternate career as a stand-up comedian. He really is very funny. We laugh at jokes for hours on end and the humour ranges from the intelligent to the downright sick (read Sickipedia). He is also a brilliant actor and has an uncanny knack for imitating other people. You can tell that Aditya is passionate about anything automotive, be it cars or aeroplanes. Aditya is crazy about music too, the perfect example being how he's managed to learn to play the drums (very Lars Ulrich-esque I might add) and guitar on his own. He's also a fan of Kishore Kumar and Kumar Sanu, and we've had some great discussions about them. After three years of going to lectures together, I think we're both afraid of sitting next to each other cause, we are most likely to implode with laughter about any odd thing that happens in class! We have a special wavelength for this thing and the jokes are almost telepathic. A guy always ready to have a good time and we always enjoy going to the ashram. Cheers to us bro, and may you always be the way you are. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ameya-karambelkar">Ameya Karambelkar</a></p>
<p>Modak is a full on bindass banda .He is a true genius when it comes to acads a person with high grasping and innovative thinking but thats not it he is a pure entertainer a die hard jim carrey fan who has this special talent of mimicry and making the instantaneous jokes form some vague and uncorrelated topics.He has made going to mess a pleasant event by serving everyone with tea/coffee and his jokes.He is also the brand ambassador of Anantashram in our campus always willing to go there.He has got a good taste of music ,plays drums and guitar .Best of luck for your future bro :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raman-ladda">Raman Ladda</a></p>
<p>Modak! Before I begin, I have to tell you - 1st Jan birthday I find very cool =)
Aditya (!!) is this really really smart boy who knows how to have a blast and yet score well in his acads. He phodos his subjects and yet has the time of his life. There is this huge cackle of laughter heard in the mess and it's always Modak :) It always make me smile. This MM VP is always fun to hang out with and his amazing sense of humour is one of the few which always makes me laugh.
I have always had a great time chatting with him about automobiles and I had envied him for this awesome lunch he used to have at his PS-1 :P
P.S.: I have used an exceedingly excess number of 'always' in your testimonial but never mind, amazing you are and amazing you shall 'always' be! :)
Cheers, =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/namrata-nadkarni">Namrata Nadkarni</a></p>
<p>The awesome Aditya Modak, Always up to some diabolical plan running in his head. The way he imitates Prof is just too good. They made our boring Mech labs much more interesting.

<p>What more do I write about Modak than has already been written. He is an extrovert. Charisma oozes out of him. It would take less than an eye blink for him to make friends with
anyone. He is one of the best on-the-spot speakers that I have seen. You have some problem if you don't laugh within the first 10 seconds of talking to him :P . If you see him perform 
well on stage, there are high chances he is doing it for the first time. He has an uncanny knack of taunting people and yet not letting them know that they were being taunted :P This is funny because I've seen him do it a lot of times to others :P He also has a very unorthodox way of speaking. Its quirky yet not undesirable. He is a movie buff for sure because he grabs any 
random dialogue from any movie (English or Hindi) and aptly fits it into his conversation. He is a great Mimicry artist. Suraj and him have provided one of the best belly-grabbing moments for many of us. He also is passionate about drumming and has performed for our Hostel in Zephyr for which he received many accolades.  One characteristic of Modak that I will always remember is his loud call to Ameya to call for lunch. (the hostel hears it :P). I am sure there's a lot more to him than what I've written but these things stand out for me. I'm glad to be in his company. Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>
<p>Hugely brilliant, sharp, witty, hardworking, energetic and a ever-cheerful personality..One of the most enriched minds I have ever seen..Although a 9-pointer he is absolutely not a book-worm..He is just bright and brilliant..I have not known him that closely but for what I know him I respect him a lot..There is no doubt that he gonna go long way in his life..All the best re...

<p>Aditya! be it acting or acads, he excels at both of them! I must say that MT2 would never have been same without him. I dont remember a single boring lab session. Extremely fun loving,intelligent,hardworking and a down-to-earth person. Never let go of your amazing sense of humour!! All the best for future! Stay in touch!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
<p>Well the first thing that comes to my head when I hear the name Modak, is an other name, Chirag. Yes it all began in the MT-2 labs where he overheard Mr Amalin mispronounce my name. Thanks to him, the other group members never really had to work during the labs :P He is one person who can transform the mood of any situation and thanks to his wits, I enjoyed almost every single lab that we attended together. Not just that, this chap is a brilliant artist when it comes to mimicry or acting. And nobody will ever forget the mesmerizing performance on the drums during our second Zephyr. And respect instantly grew when we were told he was playing them for the first time in his life!! My BITS journey would have been completely different if I had not met him for he is one the few reliable and a really good friends I have made. 
Hope that we stay in touch and wish you all the best for the future. And yes, please do not forget to keep entertaining us :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charith-kandala">Charith Kandala</a></p>
<p>Modak is fun!!! He has brilliant sense of humour, good acting skills.....you can't stop laughing when he is cracking jokes.

He is so good at hindi , you should hear him  talk in hindi :P He is phodu .....some 9p or something. Good person to be with.....got a new hairstyle..though just have his hair grown all around :P. Will see you around and we'll have a cup of irish coffee, wat say?? Best luck for future!!

<p>He's always there to make you laugh, whatever be the situation. His mimicry of certain profs. is well known to all of us. Had it not been for this guy, the labs would have been unbearable.

<p>Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know. Modak is an exception as he has an excess of both.A die hard Jim Carrey fan,and if anyone would replace him you have my vote.Aditya is the most energetic person on the campus and he will always have some crazy and gut-busting scheme going on in his mind. He has aptitude for mechanical and knows everything that is to know about cars n planes.We shared many good moments throughout the 3 years especially during Junkyard Contraption,Zari visits, all the jobless time spent in mess and so on.I know you will keep rocking wherever you go.Will see you around.(Ashram mostly!). All the best for your future endeavors!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-thakare">Nakul Thakare</a></p>
<p>Aditya Modak.. whenever this name crops up,I look up to see and find someone else entirely . He is such a great mimic and so lot of times I see a lot of characters enrolled into a same person and trust me its Great fun to watch and observe. Now this comic actor also has the ability to switch and play serious roles, the roles required as a student giving an exam.He gets so serious while giving the exam, that after the exam you can see all the seriousness not on him but on all the other candidates. He is all smiling after the exam and that is quite apparent in the manner which he phodofies all his subjects. I had the honour of being in company of this person for 3 years as a good friend, out of which 1 year together we sambhaloed Maharashtra mandal.We had a great time especially during Ganesh Chaturthi practices when the entertainer in him was alive almost all of the time.I would be honest that I used to be angry when he used to shrug off the work I had asked him to do but he made it up by his amazing enthusiasm during the programmes held. Chiplun Ka chokra aur BITS Goa ka sunhera chehra..,Aditya Modak, I will cherish these years spent with you. Thank you and all the best for the future<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
<p>This guy has a sparkling personality. Always cheerful. He has an excellent sense of humor. He can mimic almost anyone, impeccably. He is very witty. He is conceptually solid. Has great grasping power. He played the drums in the auditorium during zephyr n believe me it was simply awesome. He has an illustrious track record and he has kept it so with such ease. I have never seen him under any tension whatsoever. Just the mere sight of him, takes my stress away :). I enjoy his company. We have had some amazing times at Backstage and Anantashram !! Such an interesting person. He is mature enough to deal with any kind of situation. He is wise and responsible, n yet an amusing entertainer. One of the few who I look up to. It goes without saying that he will make big things happen and he will spread cheer where ever he goes. All the best Adya :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vardhan-thakar">Vardhan Thakar</a></p>
<p>One of the most unique persons I have ever known, Aditya is incredibly talented and a great person to hang out with. An excellent mimic artist who can make someone else come alive with his imitations, he mostly leaves us in peals of laughter. He always has a story to tell. He made our entire PS station come alive with his acting and jokes. Ever enthusiastic, he is extremely mischievous and is always thinking of some tricks and witty comments. He is passionately dedicated to any task he takes up, be it backstage or DoCW work or learning to play the drums. The “best anti-depressant” as I call him, he’s always there to cheer me up when I am down. A fellow dog lover and fellow spy :D He has amazing guts and can do ANYTHING you bet him to do. Yes I remember the Rs. 1.84 and I shall write you a receipt of that immediately :P He is ever ready to do tp yet aces every exam with ease thanks to his brilliant mind. (The codeword is “Take lite”). You will always be remembered as a very dear friend. All the best for the future! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
