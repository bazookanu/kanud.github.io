<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Naik</h1><p>I have only known him this semester and that too because hes in my class of a  5 UNIT ELECTIVE :D . And always i have thought only 1 thing since then, how come have i not known this guy befre. I mean i knew pappu_channia from dc obviously since almost 2 years but never knew the real guy would be only much better and awesome! One of those guys who's really fun to hang out me and i am happy our wavelengths matches so well in such a short periods of time. And I must definitely say he will be a very good friend of mine for a long long time to come.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>

<p>Papps!! I always knew this guy by name-thanks to his constant facebook updates and post, but had never actually seen him till 3-1. Ok, I might have seen him, but didnt know he was Aditya Naik. Pappu did an audit course-Western classical music- with us. He is a cool, easy going guy, generous with smiles and chit-chat. All the Best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>I can say without any doubt in my mind that I had never met anyone like Aditya Naik before(or pappu as we all fondly call him) nor will I ever meet someone like him. He simply happens to be the most unique person to all those who know him. He has this rare talent of cracking extraordinarily bad "pj's". I seriously don't know what words to describe him. This perhaps tells how different he is from rest of us. He is very passionate about music, be it listening to it or trying his hand at instruments. He happens to be a very avid gamer. He also happens to be the person who introduced me to the amazing world of DOTA. The game brought us together a lot. It was because of the game that we became really close friends. His light-hearted nature and his infinite tolerance makes him very special. I have one full year ahead with him in EEE and I am quite sure I will enjoy his company further. Wish you all the best pappuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>He is a pj genious.Is always fooling around and is constantly online :P .Another of my Physics + EEE buddy we still have another year to look forward to :) .Though he doesn't like Physics much he loves electronics and is damn good at it.A really jovial person who is always willing to help others I will always admire his happy go lucky nature ( and his ability to maintain his figure :P ).All the best Pappu!!!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-satish-kulkarni">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Pappu a.k.a The Great God of PJ's

He has mastered the art of PJ'ing, and he can literally kill you with that.

Very fun loving person, n also very hardworking, did almost all the lab reports :P, if you get a chance, don't think twice in making him you lab partner. :D

Will miss you papu, sorry pappu :(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Here's to one of the greatest guys I have me. We have a lot in common. Physics, EEE, Mumbai. As kids we lived a stone's throw from each other. Yet I met him for the first time in BITS. Strange. But this guy is a true gem. Whenever I've felt bad (bordering on suicidal ) during exams, he is my go-to guy. Let me tell you. His jokes are not funny (some of them are actually). The way he tells them is. My Physics study buddy, partly due to the awesome time I have with him and partly because of his phone :D . He has the ability to make you feel good even when you know you are going to royally fucked (Q.Mech T1 T2 Compre ). I remember we hadn't understood jack and yet on the way to the exam this guy was making me laugh ! If it weren't for you Physics would have been real hell. Thank you for making it so much fun! We've still got one more awesome year to go. Hooha ! -Fungii<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>
<p>POKE! POKE! who's there....ob ra PAPPU da :P Pappu aka Aditya (sometimes :P) is a totally superfantasticallyfantabulouslyinsanelytalentedbutretarded person this college can ever see. I was introduced to him in 1-2 when I joined DoPY, where he and Raj managed to make me ROFLMAO :P From then on, until recently when we made the Zephyr hostel video and participated in group song together, I have had FUN FUN FUN FUN with him :) (and looking forward to the weekend too :{) He will shine like a crazy ass star wherever he goes with his wit and maddening charm & not to forget his slapstick humor.Enjoy and keep rocking :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>PAPPU..If there was an award for best PJs this guy's room would be full..He is fun and you won't realize the time you spend with him..actually time flies..He is always smiling and making others cheerful. A good DOTA player and  keyboard player. His attitude towards life is awesome and you are welcomed to his room any time. I owe him big time for waking me up and taking me to tuts and tests. He is a total time pass guy and i am happy that I have one more year to spend with him(EEE...:P). All the best and be who you are...:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>

I feel music is the main reason which united us a lot..Aditya naik has excellent music sense , he is a very good singer and infact very few people knew dat he is a very gud dancer :P..His sense of humour is imba, there are no words to explain abt it, infact there is a fan club in facebook on his name, by that u can understood how popular his jokes might be…Whenever me and him were together there is no limits for our sarcastic and nonsense talks and many guys in our corridor got ‘df’ ed by us especially abhijit joshi (poor guy) :P .. when me, naik and ashyn were  together there is no limit for our chudaap discussion :P we used to laugh like anything by cracking jokes on lot of random issues starting from a microorganism to an alien :P We used to have enormous fun everyday by cracking lot of random , silly, senseful and some nonsense jokes..all we do  to make ourselves laugh for dat day and others around us to laugh by our jokes :P My last b’day was the best I ever had and it was just awesome because of aditya naik only..I felt like it was his bday and not mine when I saw the hungama he is making on dat day :P we used to go for gocarting,panjim, vasco ,madgao many times and the fun which we had in evrytrip is unlimited especially with this kind of a guy beside us..Well we have lots of plans from here, we thought about goin for lots of foreign holiday trips in d comin days… Though its painful to leave him in d campus after my 4-1, but im sure our friendship will continue where ever we might be in d world and infact im not leaving him :P..I hope I shuld start a company along wid him or else we shuld work together in same company and continue our random talks in order to make others laugh through our jokes  :) It wouldn’t have been this great life in bits if I wouldn’t have met aditya naik..Thankyou so much for everything:) and all the very best for ur future keep rocking\m/ ..well if I continue like dis it will go pages n pages saying abt him :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raj-shekar">Raj shekar</a></p>

<p>These webpages aren't enough to describe Aditya Sachin Naik alias pappu_channia alias handsomeaditya420 alias as(s)naik. I mean, the guy's jokes are legendary (and retarded) enough to have warranted a Facebook group. 

Well, you have acquaintances, you have friends, you have best friends, but this guy is something different. This is the guy that made this campus seem less intimidating. The guy who would always give moral support when you need it. The guy who could twist every word you say and make you seem like a fool. The guy who could make you mad enough to beat yourself with a stick. The guy who could make you laugh till your sides ache.

I'll always remember our days in campus. The times when I used to learn Thermo from you. Our failed attempts at jamming together. The times when we used your belly as a speed bag. The times when you used to put on retarded music videos just to irritate me. The times when we used to sit behind you for DFing purposes during DotA (remember Butterfly with Int hereos?). The times when we played TT. The times when I used to make those fisherman jokes. The time when we had a fight about a dumb little Matka game. The times when we went jogging around the campus. The time we played carrom in the SAC and heard long stories about pro uncles and grand dads. The times when you used to barge into everyone's room and say "OMG, ZzzZ" (you know what ZzzZ is). The helmet wali strategy. The carrom board situation. Oh btw, I remember the reason why my pristine language got so damn dirty, YOU!

I could write much much more, but then all these bums' words would look minuscule.

Keep doing what you do, Popo.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-raj-pant">Aditya Raj Pant</a></p>
<p>This guys gmail ID is "handsomeaditya420" and is perfect for him. He is "handsome", so handsome that he now has a belly to hide it. 420 is apt for him cos this guy never tires of making jokes. Infact jokes would be the wrong word, even PJs would be wrong......... its random Bullcrap!! The 'jokes' he cracks which infuriates to no extent and yet manage to make you laugh helplessly :) He is one of the closest friends(not closet friend like appa) I consider myself lucky to know him so well. An extremely chilled out guy, he never takes offense of whatever crap I say :D His jokes can lift you up when one's sad, when all hope is lost, when world looks like mordor. Its like his jokes are the Light of Earendil in my frodo-esque struggle to make sense of this life. You are my Galadriel!! (sry couldnt resist LotR :P) The first guy i turn to when i need help, he has always there for me like a rock :) We have had our share of epic moments, mindless rotten conversations and have come up with some epic terms :D :D  Our brainless conversations on FB have been \m/ We have had our discussions on every topic under the sun and the best thing abt him is that he is a willing listener. He will listen to all your beliefs and stories (though will pepper them with his PJs) An extremely lite person, he takes his studies a bit lite too, but if he really wants to phodufy im sure he can definitely be 10p sem after sem. An active DotA community member, he is not only a pro DotA player, he has also organized many LAN tournaments, even in quark.  He is also a very good photo and video editor and made some epic personalized wallpapers for his friends. He is very receptive to new things and I have practically forced him to listen to Jazz music, watch Anime, read P.G. Wodehouse (which he didnt care to even open the pages >.<).  I even took him to badminton with me, solely cos he plays worse than me and I didnt want to be worst player in the Badminton Hall :P Watching him play any sport is a treat, leaving one in splits (specially TT :P) Spending the past 3 years with him have been simple EPIC!! Sadly we have only 1 more year together (dude, Im game for year backs :P) and though we arent exactly neighbours, Im sure I will continue to haunt his room daily. Dude, be yourself. Never ever change, ur simply \m/ Keep on increasing your belly and when you finally deliver the baby I wanna be his/her god father :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Pappu is probably the only guy in our 

entire hostel whom I have never seen 

angry (maybe with Munna, but that 

doesn't count :D ) Remember thinking 

of him as a serious, phodu banda in 

those first few days of BITS. Took me 

exactly 2 weeks to realise what sort 

of a joker he was. His sense of 

humour, or whatever goes by that 

name, can be only described as 

outrageously hilarious, which takes 

most first-timers some time to get 

used to. Appreciate the fact his room 

remains always open for you; anytime 

of the day or year. 180 others in the 

hostel think the same way; explains 

why his room is also the first-floor 

common room. Can always find someone 

or the other holed up in his room, 

usually doubling up with laughter at 

his jokes (or the way he says it, 

mostly).  Has an amazing amount of 

wit and spontaneity; nobody else can 

possibly come up with Gunda style 

raps in such a short time. Still 

remember the first song you managed 

to corrupt (Khuda Jaane, wasn't it?) 

which had me and Siddharth in splits. 

Has a supreme intellect, only is too 

lazy to ever use it. Is the best 

person on campus to have any sort of 

conversation about, seeing that he 

will always turn any topic into the 

lamest joke possible and still manage 

to make you laugh while at it; he has 

developed into sort of an Agony Aunt 

for people with problems. Has a 

slightly suspicious relation with 

some of my hostel people; munna and 

appa prime among them. Another 

fascinating aspect to this guy is 

that he doesn't mind jokes on himself 

at all - have cracked more jokes on 

this guy's paunch over the last few 

years than I can remember, but he 

never gets pissed. Extremely helpful; 

will never turn you down for any kind 

of work - the Gunda video he helped 

in editing was epic :D Also a source 

of much edibles especially after his 

Mumbai visits. He allows anybody and 

everybody into his room; if you get 

any obscene pings or links from his 

gtalk, you can easily understand that 

is not him but some other miscreant 

hiding under pappu's account. This 

attention seeker has recently become 

famous on fb due to his epic CID pic 

(and he also has his own fan club). 

His out-of-this-world sense of humour 

apart, Aditya Naik is a friend for 

all seasons and a truly wonderful 

person, how much ever he tries to 

appear on the contrary :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>The email id says it all! My ps I buddy, hes also a fellow misal pav fanatic. AoE pro, Pappu is truly known for one and only one thing, his jokes. Dhoot ka Dhoot aur Paani ka Paani, Baba Lagin, like a boss, Pappu's creations and discoveries have a habit of releasing right during tests , exactly when Pappu Fan Club needs them.

<p>Pappu... one hell of a character you are man. Its a wonder to see that you take somethings seriously too. The level of your PJs rival mine... :P and are simply out of this world... :) ...  Yet you posses a good attitude and are hard working for your goals. Have seen your curiosity for knowledge and willingness to learn and m sure that you will achieve success where ever you go in life. All the best mate, it was fun knowing you :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
