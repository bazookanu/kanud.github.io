<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Palnitkar</h1><p>He is your quintessential good boy â€“ very difficult to find a flaw in him. A very friendly and humble person. He would probably never say no to anyone who asks him for help. One of his distinct traits is his calm nature. I have never seen him perturbed unnecessarily. A self-assured guy who works hard to accomplish his goals. He is ever ready to take any initiative. Needless to say, he is very intelligent, brilliant at acads and a good writer. I had a wonderful time with him during our PS-1 at BARC especially on our ride back home. I have had stimulating discussions with him and always learnt something new in the process. Prefers watching movies over tv shows. I know you will scale new heights of success in future.. All the best! Stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-dhoot">Shruti Dhoot</a></p>
<p>Aditya Palnitkar comes across a nice suave guy, one who pores over books, is humble, quiet, studious, and docile. However, only at a glance. From the shy innocent second year in DoJMA with whom we discussed random facts about Quark 2009 after 1st meeting, to a major annoyance in the CDC year, topping all his subjects, Aditya Palnitkar has come a long way. A focused, dedicated and hardworking person, Aditya (Bhaiyya?), has garnered respect from both his seniors and juniors. Be it academics, or the department work, he has excelled at both, coming up with an impressive record. As his stint as the Spree Coordinator in Spree 2011, Palnitkar awed every one with his management skills, and cool attitude. He has an incredible sense of humour, and can take jokes against himself very well (that epic dc chat, where we managed to scare you: D). An amazing writer, he comes up with some really inspiring articles, and uses sarcasm effectively to add quality to them. Apart from his various facets, he is also different from the usual rock-metal honging crowd, instead finding peace in classical music. Inspiring, reliable, assiduous, and passionate, Aditya Palnitkar is one gem of a person, one you would be glad and rather proud to be friends with.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>
