<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Raj Pant</h1><p>if i hear "oh my god!!  mihir the kar..!!" its this guy for sure....a very good guitarist and a beyond imagination level coder, pant was one of my first few acquaintances on campus. He is also one of those who hates pappu level jokes. Though we've rarely talked seriously, talking nonsense with him is a great past time i've had. Pant is also known for his dota proness in his gang (a gang which never won in matka@quark). he is also one of the linux pros of our campus, who learnt it even b4 cp1. also, as he rightly said(on fb), i am gonna miss those days of sparring with him,,,,,indeed, no doubt!!!   n b4 going, the next time u say "fod di tune", i just wish it would be ur phone. Best of luck!!hehe....  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>
<p>Puuuuuuuunnnnttt is a very dear friend with whom i have a very deep bonding. He always makes fun of me in a way which amuses me :D . A pro Dota player, he is one of the best gamers in the campus . His coding is beyond godlike. He is a legendary guitar player and we used to jam together . Miss those days !!! :) . Very hardworking fellow, he is always a  top scorer in his subjects and also helps everyone in academics. He hates mess food but still eats that bland food to maintain his figure :P . He can be an extremely dedicated person, which was evident from his weight loss regime which he followed religiously. Although he hates my jokes , he praises me (or not) by saying "waah ek aur gem" :D. His dialogues(bas haan bas , fod di tune , anti-rajshekhar lines) have been adapted by many in their day to day conversations. Even though he kept a low profile for the first two years in college, he has managed to win the admiration of many. I am sure he has a lot of secret admirers among the girls :D . A fellow android lover, we always suggest each other new apps on the market. He has a very clear minded, focussed and goal oriented mind, but can also be a lot of fun to be with. I can't imagine hostel life without this "gem" of a friend. All the very best to you for your future and keep smiling :)

<p>The proest guitarist and programmer that i have ever met in my life, this guy is truly a genius. He is a warcraft and F1 wikipedia and has a very good taste of music and movies. This guy is the one who introduced me to 70's rock and Al Pacino  :D. He is an avid gamer and is almost always talking about DOTA :P. Very fiendly and helpful, he is the only reason for me not having an ACB till now. He possesses insane amount of patience(tabhi abhi tak raju zinda hai). He is also a gadget freak and is really passionate about computer science and coding and programming etc. I will never forget our games, our bike trips and the long hours we spent talking in the corridor which ended when we all got laptops  :( .  Dude  u r truly a godlike personality. All the best for everything and i wish u have huge success in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/deepak-kesri">Deepak Kesri</a></p>
