<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Ramani</h1><p>Trivia' is the first word that comes to my mind when I think of this crazy but awesome friend of mine. His capability to narrate normal incidents in an abnormal fashion makes him a charismatic lady wooer. He has been there for me and for all of his friends when they needed him. A chilled out guy with a leveled head, despite knowing a lot he manages to be pretty cool about it. He takes his goals seriously once he actually makes up his mind. An avid Roger Federer fan and a seriously good sports blogger, a bright future is what is in stock for this procrastinator. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Ramani is one of the most chilled out persons I have known. He is a lot of fun to hang out with. I have never seen anyone so addicted to coke until I met him. Its been a pleasure to know him. I wish you all the success in life with lots n lots of more coke :) :)

<p>For those who dont know, his first name is "Aditya". Popularly known as "Ramani", I proudly call this guy my best friend. The most awesome, fun loving and chilled out guy I have ever met. One of the quizzing gods on campus. He can fit into any conversation smoothly and effortlessly. With a variety of interests like food, sports, music and literature, this guy is one of those "cool tambrahms". Thank you for making the past 8 years of my life awesome and I hope we are colleagues in the future as well! Cheers to the most awesome friend I have had till date :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>Aditya Ramani.. the first name that comes to my mind when I think about someone smart, intelligent and yet so humble. He has an extremely charming persona and friendly nature. His knowledge about the events around the world and his love for the sport of tennis is unparalleled .. No wonder he is one of the best quizzers around. I have had the pleasure of being a part of many interesting debates with this guy. Everytime you talk to him you gain some little part of his vast knowledge. A very determined person who plays to win and won't be satisfied with mediocrity in any field. One of my best friends in life and I hope we'll stay in touch for rest of our lives. May you always succeed in your life!  - HC<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshal-chaudhari">Harshal Chaudhari</a></p>
<p>Ramani. I doubt If I have ever addressed him by his first name. Great guy to have as a friend. Ever helpful and one who will always entertain you no matter how busy he may be. His witty quips are seriously hilarious and his writing needs no introduction (Did his blog just cross some 5000 reads or so?). A sports fanatic, this guy was awake all night watching a Federer match just to write the match summary for sportskeeda.com (yeah you heard it right, he writes for sportskeeda). Great company to hang out with at all times. All the best for the future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Aditya Ramani- the dude, the fellow Federer freak and sports trivia enthusiast. We had so many fun arguments together on totally random (and sometimes pointless) topics and I still remember how they got intense as time went on. A fellow quizzer (and an awesome one at that), we had some fun times. Keep in touch and have a great career.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>Ramani should be mass produced and everyone on the face of earth should have one. At least we would be able to remove boredom and loneliness from this world. He is the one person I've seen who enjoys almost everything. Its like a gift he has to find interest in everything happening around. Whatever you wanna do, Ramani will be there with you (trolling :P). Very few are there who can astound you with their knowledge and then entertain you by mimicking every human meme on the net. From a classical music concert to a football match to checking out girls, you can enjoy everything in his company. His ever smiling face can brighten up any corner around. And when he really wants to do something - (wait for it) - he does it!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jayant-dalmia">Jayant Dalmia</a></p>
<p>Ramani aka Aditya is really a fun guy to hang out with. His incessant need to contradict conventional arguments with arguments that invite o.O is the most characteristic feature of this being.  However this in no way undermines his amazing general knowledge quotient. Along with Suraj, his regular dosage of mimicry of memes made us all laugh quite often this year. His addiction to coke and his demeanour with the girls however is what makes Aditya Ramani stand out :P All the Best Ramani. May you Live Like a Sir!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>" Look at the guy standing behind APJ Kalam " (so he said ,with face brimming with pride !). Bitch , Please ! ," in many accents of people came three years later ! What  filled the time gap were many entertaining conversations, discussions on everything right from property rates in Bombay to how flushes operate on the 15 th floor in Singapore ! This explains his love for travel; from Melbourne to the Andamans he is taking his chilled out happy go lucky tam braham outlook global !   ; His impeccable proficiency in trivia from sports to biz world leaves you stunned . Very creative and humorous ; his statuses buzzes were entertaining to the core. One of the very few people on campus who relish classical music and has been a good company at performances in the auditorium. Along with the apple of his eye suraj  , over many mongi coffees i was fortunate to be a witness to the most entertaining acts of camaraderie . Hope their chemistry continues to sizzle :P.  I wont be surprised to see him as  the founder of a sports magazine or travel writer or a running a master chef India v1 ; i must ask for his few of his business cards now ; I wish him all the good luck for the big success waiting for him and of course i am going to be at the premiere opening of his beach facing restaurant ; where  ? i need not mention !   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>
<p>This guy is the definition of a noveau TamBrahm: a chill-as-a-cucumber social butterfly who can talk to anyone about almost anything. He is an excellent writer, especially of tennis and cricket. And he totally knows his shit, completely random stuff, which he can somehow showcase in a way that makes sense. Add all that to his goofy grin and it’s no wonder everybody loves him! Even the people he pisses off with his constant dissenting arguments and photobombing skills.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>Ramani has been one of the better friends i have had in college. A chilled out guy and an awesome quizzer. He has always been great company each time we went on road trips..without him those trips woudnt be as much fun.
Hope u have all the success in life! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sourav-banerjee">Sourav Banerjee</a></p>
<p>Aditya Ramani is a person having distinctive traits of many different cultures because of the number of places he has lived in.He is a person with immense knowledge in numerous fields, i'm sure every time you talk to him you will learn something new. His love for Tennis and Quizzing is truly great. When he enters his "God Mode" he is simply unstoppable, his jokes, his imitations and his unique way of calling "suuuraaajjjj" are some things i will always remember. Wish you all the best for your future prospects!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Ramani, i don't think I've ever called him by his first name in the 5 years that i've known him. He's one of the smartest people i know, but he just doesn't use it for studies. Amazing knowledge about every possible field, whatever country, whichever sport, you name it and he knows it. And he's probably the coolest geek i know! We've had awesome times, all the outings and birthdays, and all the times i've taken your case about you know who :P Thanks for all those beautiful memories, College just wouldn't have been complete without you :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>The only person that ever comes close to being me! I literally have no idea when I met him first, the probability of it being in our Hostel Common Room would be the highest :D ! He's a sports fanatic, and I love discussing sports with him a lot.Though arch rivals when it comes to supporting our Tennis Gods,I loved the rationale debates,the moments when each of us reminded the other:-"Do you remember that match when this happened?" and we were the lost in the long convos. He is great,good at the studies,very soft-spoken and humble, will miss him and the control of the TV remote,the ease with which saw some of the most epic matches in my life. Best of luck for the future,hope that sometime  we both together catch Fedex vs Nadal ,live at the Center Court SW19 :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>Most of the times I see him on his way to bathroom in boxers and with a shaving kit in his hands he wakes up in the morning ( morning for him afternoon for me). He has a very good GK. He would have earned a lot if he had given his AH4 room on rent as he in AH3 most of the time. He loves watching KBC ( I think good GK implies this statement).But overall a cool guy who takes li8...
All the best<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Aditya - better known as Ramani, is one of the few people around who can slip in to any conversation effortlessly. An awesome quizzer and mimic, he brightens up the mood. He's a big fan of sports in general and tennis and cricket in particular. Even though he was allotted AH4 he's mostly found in his best-friend (read gay-partner), Suraj's room. Its always been fun hanging out with him. Wishing you all the best for the future buddy!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kedar-deshmukh">KEDAR DESHMUKH</a></p>
<p>Rum-ah-nee! The baldish guy with a huge forehead who looks intelligent and I want him on my team in Aero. That's how it started. And then there was quizzing. And techfests. And old hindi classics by Rafi and Kishore Kumar. A true Federer fan, awesome quizzer, occasionally funny with his PJs, and damn smart. You were one of my first friends on campus and it's been a real pleasure having you around. Here's to all the great times we've shared. Wishing you all the very best in life! Do stay in touch :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>Ramani, sometimes referred to as aditya, is one of your typical tam-brams if they –believe afternoon are sunrise, federer is god, trolling is a way of life. Fun, cheerful, honest and confused between Suraj and pretty much every girl that ever lived (the jury is still out on that one)  he is always nice to hang out with and have the most insane conversations with. He likes his “pride” often on the rocks. It’s been delightful knowing you. Keep writing, have fun. Kick some butt.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijeet-mehrotra">Abhijeet Mehrotra</a></p>
