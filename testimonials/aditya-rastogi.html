<p>Rastogi.. He has a great sense of humor. It is fun to hang out with him. His wackiest one liners & unforgotteble humorous jokes are unbeatable.

<p>Rastogi is one guy everybody should treasure as a friend. His bindaas attitude, caring nature and concise and logical thinking are an example for others. He is the one who has been on the receiving side of my anger most of the times :D Asks me for a pack of biscuits everytime and hardly returns it. Every night before the exam, he ‘explodes’, says kuch nahi aata, katta hone waala hai and most of the times ends up phodufying the exam. Right Subaansu ? And now he is a Navi Mumbaikar, living just an hour away. All the best for your future dude and do keep in touch. And Rastogi, Mumbai is obb better than Noida :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Aditya Rastogi ..........one of the few persons who embodies the word "bindaas" in this college.....!!!!Met him when he taught me the "pipe bending" experiment in workshop .......then it went on to be a three year long friendship .......!!!!!!!!Sharp and sincere with his academics ,witty in his retorts , funny in his demeanor ,emotional when he is sloshed and devoted in friendship is how you describe him in one sentence ......!!!!! He flies of the handle when under tensed circumstances.... but that is the only weakness I have found in him ............!!!!Buddy I will miss all those rounds of nocturnal stealthy activities that we undertake on a regular basis , all the nightouts, all the bogmallo trips , all the drinking binges and everything else when you are not here next sem. Stay happy wherever you are and always be the person you now are for your nature is the thing that makes you so appealing to me and everyone else ...!!!All the best for your life ahead ....!!You will be missed ......:)!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-choudhury">Rahul Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Rastogi you're one person who came make any situation light by your witty remarks. You're one person who can make us laugh at almost everything and anything.. I've had several nyt outs with you and one hell of a trip covering Mumbai, Pune, Mahabaleshwar and delhi. Its always been fun to hangout with you. You've given me several moments that I'd love keep with me forever...Remember that dialogue "whats up babes"? I wont dwell into things like u're pretty good at acads n all.

<p>Rastoogiiiiii!! Ekdum masssstttt banda, totally cool and bindaaaassss!! :D I got to know him 1-2 me and since then we have been gr8 frnds. He is alwaysssss so much fun to hang around with. He can make even a very simple line seem so hilarious by the way he speaks :D godlike sense of humour and nothing affects him at all. No one can live life in a better way than this guy. He can have more fun than anyone else and at the same time "phodofy" in academics. His bindas nature and positive attitude makes him an extraordinary person. He is an awesome frnd and its always great fun to be with him :D I am going to miss all the times spent with you, the various outings-bogmalo, palolem, utorda, etc etc and all the fun we had on campus. It was really great meeting a guy like you! Always remain the same "massssttt" Rastogi and hope to remain in touch in future. All the very best and i am sure you'll do well in life. Have a great and mindblowing life ahead! Cheers !! :D:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>
