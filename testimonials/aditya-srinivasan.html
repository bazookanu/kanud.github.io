<h1 class="page-title">Aditya Srinivasan</h1><p>Hey Srini, though it hasn't been long since I've known you, but It's been fun all the same. That Indiafest outing we had was epic, and even though we were stuck in that stupid traffic jam for hours, I had fun then. I've come to know you as a fun loving guy, who still manages to get good grades. It's been great knowing you, and hope it stays that way in the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-bhatt">Chaitanya Bhatt</a></p>
<p>Srini!!  We met in the first year and didn't really hang around (as much as we could, if u know what i mean )but still ended up staying "good" friends till date! Its incredible how you manage to get a 9 each sem even after those wild night outs and uncountable bogmalo trips right before the exams! Super smart and super chilled out , you have always made those bogmalo trips a lot more fun (read Ranjita and the placebo effect). You shall be missed in every John's trip that we take the next semester. Wishing you all the best in life and a happy "high" future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Aditya Srinivasan feels so strange! I'd rather call you srini even when you're 60 years old and probably the president or something, because trust me you *are* capable of that :P I have never seen anyone who "takes li8" as much as you do and yet you manage almost everything perfectly the last minute. I've had so much fun with you around at CMC, in DECO labs where you magically manipulated all the outputs, all those ice n spice sessions! And I'm really going to miss those days. What I find most amazing about you is that I have never seen you not simling, and you are always so damn excited to do anything new, I guess that's what makes you one of the most nearly perfect guys I've met so far. So keep smiling and you don't forget to be in touch wherever you go. Wishing you loads of luck and love!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>Srini! ever since I've met you its always been such a pleasure to be around you. You are a very talented person and you have this wonderful ability to always make a conversation lively. I also love the way you appreciate everything, and thats a brilliant thing...the way u say it.."brrrrilliant!" :P. I have no idea how u manage to attend zero classes, take lite, be so chilled out, play games all the time so that u don't have time to chat, go sit at bogmalo n still score a 9 point something :| Anyways, some memories i will always take along are the few (i mean it) outings u agreed to come for, the treats u got exploited for and of course PS :D :D :D That was the best! you have always been a very close friend I could share things with. And I love the fact that we have so many common interests and common interest in all the southie food that all these other people never understand :P. Always be this way n DO keep in touch. I'm sure you will make it a long long way in life. Good luck n take care! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tara-ramanan">Tara Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Fucking Pro. Seriously . Ample space has been taken to write about how you take li8 and crack exams. I won't elaborate on that. What I will say is this. Its been fun having you around. You really have the best room in the hostel. It was great fun studying there during the exams. Fellow music lover and lecture bunker :D . I've always admired your ambition and your clear sightedness regarding what you want to do later in life. Hope you achieve all that and more.

<p>This darling of mine is a chick magent ( see how many girls have written for him as compared to guys :P ) and surely one of the best friends I have made for my life here. 
A hard worker who knows what he has to achieve and sets himself right on track, be it taking a vertical to CS from Eco or be it playing DOTA AOE all those nite. He loves getting appreciated from girls and loves to be called cute - yes he loves it so do call him CUTE. 

Been that ideal teacher and motivator who has been there for me whenever I need his help in academics or be it in my personal life. Awesome DOSM d00d who used to go with us ( corridor mates ) to Bogmalo and end up with random bunch of chicks from campus ( we used to be jealous of him :P ) .
He loves classical and instrumental music, he just loves it. A TAMBRAM who drinks and talks random bull shit but still he's my love. Those beautiful sem1 and sem2 days when we used to hang out 24*7 be either playing something or discussing about life or future. This chap is clear and true to his work, he can bloody easily convince anyone and still he left DOSM :P .
Fat salary poss apartment big car and those luxury has always been his dream and I hope you live the life of ur dreams but I shall come along then with Guru .
I remember that sem2 day when I was struggling in Bio some avg-60 I was precompre and I had no hope to cover it up, but this guy who dint have Bio that sem taught me some basics, asked to stay up the whole nite in his room read as much as I cud and motivated me that I cud score, I got avg + 21 in compre Period. I dont remember anytime before exams when his room isnt flooded right from sem1 test1 to now, people from various branches come and study random subjects, his presence and that dedication inspires people to work with the same dedication. 
I am proud that I entered girls hostel in IITB and you couldn't ( thus ends my sem1 frustration of being jealous ). He is damn friendly to almost everyone and his room is sort of a common room for groups of people. 
I wish he was in same branch as mine, I would have studied and score atleast SOME marks. He is a quick learner who has that quest for learning as much as he can, be it related to playing LAN games or coding or related to finance.

He wants to be an Investment Banker, to handle my investments and my transactions so  that my future is in safe hands. Had fun working with him for Waves and for NSEF, its always been pleasure to work with him.
He is like the corridor's bitch , be the same forever coz after 10-15 years when I see you I would still call you Srini Darling.
And yeah we that Indiafest Nite out was awesome and we need to go for one legendary one soon.
If I have forgotten anything, I shall come to your room and tell you. 

Next sem go to PS earn loads of cash, lets party together in the last sem coz life has just started for us .

Love you Man ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>The Tamil Tigress and Ultimate Pussy, Srini's been an amazing guy to know over the past few years. A big wannabe, huge bewda he is a lot smarter than he seems. Still don't get how you manage to get such good grades inspite of the deep running influence of Velinos and Vodka. Srini's great fun to be around, to laugh with, and to take Guru's case. Wish you were here next sem so that we could take Guru's case even more. Have fun, and best of luck for the future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>Srini aka wannabe ladies man! Had the pleasure of knowing him in 1-2 and since then we have become real close friends. I will always remember how much we used to hang out, chill out with guru and the rest of the gang. Saale, left eco for CS..... I really miss a study-buddy :( Economics with you would have been so so Epic. I would have got a perfectly legitimate excuse to study in his AC powered room. This guy loves to rub people the wrong way for petty laughs and some of the convos with you were really Epic!! I will never forget our phase of calling each other lewd names and coming up with new expletives :P A fellow dota newb, we had some really awesome moments specially when this guy was not in his 'normal' state. This guy has a knack for convincing others to do what HE wants and is also a great guy to talk to aboutl life. He has helped me immensely during times i felt low, always managing to bring a smile to my face :) Also, in his heart this guy is gay, does all gay harkate and finally came out of the closet and found a life-partner in his neighbour Guru. Ever since his relationship, he became busy and saala didnt even invite me to his treat (I will take my revenge Muahahahaha), but we were are and will be friends for life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>It is surprising for me to see 5:3 ratio of boys' testimonials vs girls' testimonials :P Hope this situation changes over time. Came to know him because I never saw his door closed during my 3 years in AH4. There is always someone in his room either playing FIFA or studying at the time of exams. Famous for his power naps and high efficiency and performance during exams. A good AOE player. A good person in general and a better one if you are a girl... :P

<p>Sriniiiiiiii...... man I have loads to write about you and I'm pretty sure that this white space won't do justice to it! I clearly remember that the first time I met him was in AIEEE counselling at VNIT Nagpur and back then I had a(much) better AIEEE rank and BITSAT score than him! It was only then that things were that way..... in BITS things turned out to be exactly the opposite! :P 
Our parents instantly bonded at AIEEE counselling center and we became friends right then!
As it started out, we met again in BITS Goa and again fatefully, he stood right before me to get the best room in my corridor and me getting one of those scalding hot rooms! Phew! Since then, our floor had a common room and that is his, only to be found overpopulated during exams(as it is now)!
I've shared the longest history of events (in BITS) with him and yes, the deepest of secrets! I was like this innocent kid, who as my parents mockingly remarked, was to be looked after by this 'big' brother of mine here! Of course, I totally relate to the idea of size doesn't matter and you'll remain my big brother always! :P
I can't really list out the countless things he has helped me with! He has been responsible for more than half the transformation in my personality. From time to time we've given each other enough reasons to feel jealous of each other and even more to remain the thickest of friends! Man, we've been in a relationship......or I should say, it's damn complicated! :P
It was always fun to have an intellectual discussion with you and even more fun to poke each others egos and see them shape the discussion that followed with all kinds of psychological, scientific, metaphysical and spiritual stuff making their way to take things to unbelievable heights of ideality and depths of thought, and suddenly collapse all the mental constructs with some tharki discussion right then! He is, as he puts it, is by default the ladies man..........but we all know he is a wannabe ladies man!!!:P
If not for him, I would've gone into depression looking at my marks in the first sem(I didn't realize what would come later :P )! Actually I was on the verge of going into one and he really got me out of the whole thing with his advice and counselling! :') 
Of course I returned the favor when he was in a moral dilemma and was stuck with his thermo exam incident! ;) Those memories are unforgettable!
Personal boundaries never existed. We both know each others hidden talents and heights of stupidity alike and always took real bad digs at each other. Though I was on the losing side initially, I did manage to score some points eventually. We're even now!
Put together, we're two egoistic darlings who just can't stop being stupid and creative in each others company! :D
I should say, he's damn intelligent (though my ego has always denied it and will always :P ), real smart and unbelievably hardworking only when it comes to what he wants to do! In everything else, he knows what's going on but he wouldn't manipulate things just for petty gains (....but for big gains, yes he would ;) ). He's _/\_ at manipulating things and I had my first lessons in the same from him! I never really gained much proficiency at it though! :P
 I've always had my chance to taunt him when he came to borrow my violin imposing umpteen conditions on its use, which he did meticulously follow (though nothing came my way when I used to borrow his keyboard)!  He would be the first person to come to my room and comment/advice on the new instrument/new musical piece that I'd try. My first audience in music, I should say!
He has a good taste for music and variety and we both share, pretty much, the same ideas about both in life! About life though, our ideas seem so different!
I've always criticized him for taking up management as his career option, while he has an excellent aptitude for core compsci! I was always told by him to focus on one thing while my interests would have me doing a lot of things (except studies).I've always tried to believe in controlling events in life, while he always goes with the flow of things. One thing that I learnt from him properly was this and he just glides smoothly across time and takes life easy when the going gets hard! I simply don't know how we fit so well in the irony of life! 
I could just write on and on......
All the trips we had, the great screw-ups, quarrels and fights, ego clashes, multitudes of intellectual (and tharki) discussions to all those emotional moments will never be forgotten! These memories will haunt me forever( and I'll make sure they do the same to you too! :) ) 
You'll be missed a LOT!  :')
All the best in whatever you do in the future! Don't forget your little brother out here! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Srini = Phodu, Big time. One of my sane neighbours, this guy bunks more classes than me (and THATS saying something..). yet has a cgpa of more than 9. We met on the train to goa in our first year, and hes one of my oldest friends here. Srini also plays the piano, but i've never heard him play probably in the efforts to drown the noise from Viggy's room. Hes a very organized person and when it comes to academics and responsibilites, delegates his time to every task well and judiciously, i think hes a machine. Besides that he also runs a business, whose exclusive details would be too offensive here, but its safe to say that its a success. Hes another subdued party animal, studies for exams like anything and then parties like there's no tomorrow. Hes got brilliant taste in music and also an awesome set of  speakers, well i would really love the latter. We've had great times together, the Angrez night, the B-dome antics and the usual guru/viggy bashing. But,fasten your seatbelts my friend, 4-2 is going to be EPIC!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Srini aka the Noob has a knack for doing the right things at the right time. We have had epic times in Goa, especially the trip to Ponda, where Srini knew what it is like to have no boundaries. I've often discussed future plans and whatnot with him, and found an optimistic guide each time. He's also taught me enough at the eleventh hour to save my skin during exams. One of the biggest lovers of Indian classical music I know, I hope he learns to play the keys well enough to play some carnatic on that keyboard of his. I'm sure we'll keep in touch after college and attend loads of live shows together.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
