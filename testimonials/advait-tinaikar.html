<p>So mister tinku denaykar a.k.a. the skinny white guy, the time has come when i have to sit and pen down our mermories together.Well, i first met u was with your mom just before coming to BITS.First impression said it all: Momma's Buoy, studious and crazy about football.Luckily me and u got rooms right in front of each other and thus began my journey with the great Stphen Hawking :P.Everyday, u used 2 wake me up for all early morning classes(though i didn't attend any).Three years have passed in no time. The silly fights, the great outings, the serious discussions, the crazy Dosm phone conversations u had with sponsors all the time...man will miss all these.The unique  "Dammit and Bullshit" that u do every morning. And thanx for listening to my Rap/Hip-Hop/Aoe/Dota  all the time.Well, would like to finally say that you've been a great friend buddy and i ll cherish these years for the rest of my life.All the best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sarang-shamshery">Sarang Shamshery</a></p>

<p>Advait, i never told him this, but the first time i met(or in this heard) him was while waiting in line for our ID pics to be taken. U were in a discussion with the people around the entire time, nd the first impression i had of u was, GOSH! does this kid ever shut up!!(sorry, never told u this incident) Then, we were formally introduced to each other by sarang, nd since that day, the respect for him has only grown.. He was one of the most hard working,sincere ppl, and a bit crazy about hygiene :P Glad to have spent the best 3 years of my life with him, have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ahut-gupta">Ahut Gupta</a></p>
<p>Tinaikar, I have known you only because of my time in DoSM. The only time I actually worked with you was in Quark 2012 and it was great. I really appreciate the amount of effort you put into everything and I have learnt a great deal from it. And yes, your ideas. They are damn awesome! Thanks a lot.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-pant">Aniket Pant</a></p>
<p>Advait Durgesh Tinaikar....naaah iTINKUUUUUUUUU suites better..(one of the proudest moment of my life was wen I came up wid dis name tho he never gives me credit for this) 
the first impression of tinku was completely opposite of his current imag...he was "the white skinny guy" who looked like stephen hawking and solved the entire thermo text book twice while we all used to watch movies/play..
tinku has been more like a partner in almost everything I have done in bits...starting wid a stint at Quest in Quark(some random festival :P), CLEO,CIMA, Techfest(supposedly), CDCs,and the best of all PS1(with the cooking , swimming, pool , bowling, HRC , ur house, u not being able to go to KFC)...shit we actually did too many thngs together.... we also happen to share the same passion for mechanical engineering(non technical part) and bschools..
now about the professional tinku…he is a true perfectionist …he gives his best shot to whatever he does.. be it even for a small fest quark , which he actualy made it really big(and even tho I dun say m proud of u for tht) or even a small ppt…
a very innoncent guy who doesn’t even realize whats happening around and what all he has done from updating fb statuses with “certain” names to unknowing flirting with the c mess aunty…
u have been an amazing company through out my bits life…and I hope we also end up in the same ps2…really looking frwd to our las sem together on campus…

<p>Where do i start? Which adjectives do i use? I think I got to know him extremely well when we were in the same group for preparing a b-plan and man my respect for this lanky Arsenal fan has grown ever since. I think we have a lot in common but to be honest he has achieved all that he could in college professionally whereas I wasted my time sleeping.  He has been one of my bestest buddies in campus and his friendship is one I will treasure all my life. And yeah I will do anything to make F&P associates the best in its business. Wish u great success in life man!!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>Tinku Jiya! :D
I have known him mostly cos of my time in DOSM. That scary serious face of which juniors used to be scared of. The amount of hardwork he has put in for QUARK 2012 in simply incredible, not to forget that it was a great success in the sponsorship department and all the credit goes to him.  A great guy who gives initially an impression of a mean (:P) person. But he took me by surprise by a certain thing :P (oops! someone). He is always at its best. A damn nice friend and a great coordinator whom one can always go to seek some 'not-so-sensible' advice cos he is damn lame and GAY :P Keep In touch! Will miss you.

<p>Sugar. Spice. And evrything Nice.
These were the ingredients to create the perfect little girl.
The reactor blew up though.
And out came Advait Tinaikar, aka, TINKU.

This skinny white almost-albino hawking-doppelganger friend of mine has been a great source of fun, mirth and much amusement. And yet he's been one of my most closest friends on campus!
He (almost) shares his bday with me, he shares a passion for mindless violence with me and he's just fun to talk to! :-D Have spent hours and hours in his room and irritating the hell outta him only to watch Amit wake up and come out screaming at him :-D
Still remember him learning AOE for weeks in sem1 after i outlasted him in a game. This guys a ferocious competitor!
Still remember that odd-spiked hair photo back from first sem to the 'uff teri adaa' choreography! And how can i possibly forget his every empty threat to hit me, kill me, murder me etc. after every katta of his we did. :-P He's the biggest madwaadi at heart who keeps track of every lil thing he did for you and expects favours in return and yet hes the one who almost without any questioning pumped in so much money into Quark as Spons Chief that he almost helped make it profitable :-P

Tinkerbell. Tinku. Tinks. ( I even remember Sarthak briefly calling you the 'Tink Tank' during CLEO! :-P) Bro, uve been an awesome part of my BITS life. And you're a guy I respect like CRAZY!
(just chill with the hygiene issues, it aint helping! You still catch that cold! :-P)
Hope U the Chief of one of the Biggest Businesses in the world. If u running it, it'll be in safe hands...(as long as those hands don't have any paperballs in ém. :-P)
Gonna miss your random groaning every time i threatened to hit you! :-D
Have a fantabulous amount of success with everything that you do! And ya, keep that freakish smile on! It makes you look a lil less sick :-P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maanit-mehra">Maanit Mehra</a></p>
<p>Initially I thought you were a humanoid robot, considering the amount of work you do and the way everything around you is so structured. But man, you have emotions, so many of them! Passionate, Workaholic, Geek, Lover-Boy, you surprise me at the end of every meeting we have. Spearheading Quark 2012, you have been an idol for our batch and the juniors alike. I wish we had more time to spend together, there so much I need to imbibe from you. I know you don't need it, but still, best of luck, may your future be brighter than your skin-tone. Hope we take the legacy forward. Neil Merchant 2010B4A8581G<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Advait!! This guy loves to talk... And he will talk on and on well almost on anything and evrything until he's proven his point. No wonders he's good at marketing and the likes. For starters, he's a workhorse... a dedicated marketing machine.. Always busy with something or the other... An ideal case of 'Achcha Bachcha', 'Maa ka ladla' types; I feel Sometimes he needs to just 'chill'. It's okay to not do anything and be less responsble sometimes, Advait :P (And it's all the more surprising you haven't learnt much of it even when Debanjum had been living just doors away all this while :D ) And yeah, sometimes his white brain analyzes things way too much :P But most importantly, He's been one hell of a friend all along. All those times and our shared memories will be cherished for times to come. Your 'Damn-It' and 'BullShit' oneliners will be missed fondly. From the time, when we barely knew each other in our junior college, We have come a long way...Wish this wonderful journey of ours continues for many more years to come and I hope to see you going great places in future... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurabh-nayak">Saurabh Nayak</a></p>
<p>Advait....kya bataaun...I mean now that I know him he feels more shaitaan than a 7 year old kid :P...quite the opposite of the impression I had of him in the first sem when I used to see him in the library sitting with Kolenkow and trying to solve the mechanics problems in Physics-1 (something I hated to do and would run away from always)...well he indeed can be a kid at times (courtesy: a little bird from MT-2 lab :P) and loves to pull people's legs (difficult to figure out when you are being serious or sarcastic or when you are joking)...Thanks to the Java classes in our first year summers, I got to know Advait and since them we have been able to strike the cord of friendship. He just loves to have fun all the time and is someone who can always talk about taking li8...the most dedicated DOSM co-ordy I have seen working for Quark and helping in making it big...oh ya!!! he is the only guy probably on my entire gtalk list whose status is always difficult to decipher (I mean sometimes I have to actually go to the net to find out what some of his status messages would be about :P). Also he is a football lover....nonetheless I must admit that he has been a very helpful friend over the past two years. He believes that the world is beckoning him and so I ll leave it here by wishing him good luck for his future endeavors and I hope that he is able to make it big in the  big world out there waiting for him. Always stay in touch and remain the friend and the same person that you are :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Advait Tinaikar. Wow. Where to start. I mean, you are reading this testimonial right now, and still imaging my 'well endowed' physique, and wanting to mock me, arent you ? I mean, seriously, this guy just doesnt stop teasing me. My weight, my incessant cravings for incessant amounts of food, my torn and tattered clothes. Yes, I officially admit all of those. It is this that makes the relationship so special. I mean life is on a roll when I am with this guy. Surely, I love to tease his albino-like complexion, and all the stupid 'nakhras' he does while going on outings, his 'hidden' tharkiness, and so on. It is this exchange of mockery that makes my times with Advait the most memorable and cheerful. I have learnt so much from you, the organisation and stucture you put into your work and your study, the professionalism you put into your DoSM work, your ability to bond with the juniors and yet discipline them to be a strict follower of yours, I mean, it has really been awesome just observing you work through 2009 to 2012. Cheers to an awesome 3 years in DoSM !!
PS: You might learnt to be a bit polite and a bit modest!! (Of course you dont expect me to not mock you before I end the testimonial, do you? )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mrinmay-milind-kulkarni">Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Advait! It has been fun knowing you! whether fr Dosm or for the 3 hour argument we had in audi during the green conference! It was indeed fun. I had had such a "heated" and such a "terrific" argument after a very long time. Thankyou!!!! Do keep in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yashu">Yashu</a></p>
<p>Not getting to know him personally but one thing I do know about him is he is very hardworking, passionate about his work, no matter if its acads or dosm work. I wish u all the very best for ur life :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>We met for the first time when we became lab partners in MT1 Physics. Quite unique group hunh. This person, sathe and me. I remember sathe doing some random masti on the comp, me getting irritated coz of him and advait doing the experiment. Sathe should be thankful to us as we helped him in the quiz all the time. The group was unique for one more reason that all of us know marathi but we never talked in marathi. I remember when we touched some buttons of CRO ( ob they weren't supposed to be touched) and then we had to do the experiment again in the evening.lol
All the best for ur future ....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
