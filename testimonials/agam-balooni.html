<h1 class="page-title">Agam Balooni</h1><p>Agam Balooni is a really nice person. If there is something you must do as soon as you meet him is to listen to him singing. He has a really nice voice. He performed really well in Janmashtami in 2nd year. he could become the Sonu Nigam of our generation. I wish him a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>From the formal introduction in NesC to being best friends, its been a beautiful journey. Having known him for 6 sems now, I can say that he is perfect blend of good looks, intelligence and talent.A very calm and confident person who knows exactly what to speak, how to speak and when to speak. Haven't seen a person who can be patient enough to listen to all my boring monologues :P.He is the best person to ask for any honest opinion because never ever will he tell you something which you are not just only to please you (which is not easily digestible by many :P :P). Although he is kindaa introvert person still whenever he speaks, he always says what he feels inside from his heart. Above all he is always there for you whenever you need him and never turns away, I must say anyone(has to be his friend :P) can depend on him at any time of the day. Every one has ups and downs in their life but the problems never last for long if we have special friends like him. I wonder if there could have been a name more appropriate for him than 'Agam'. Talented in infinite ways. Possibly the best singer on campus, I am saying not because I am his friend but because there is a charm and magic in his voice which will attract you. Be it acting, debating, or writing poems or painting he is equally good at all of them. He is affectionate, ambitious, artistic, charismatic, creative and an animal lover.Loves his pets like anything. He has that smile which will make you forget all your worries. Agam, I will miss irritating you. I will really miss our walks, recitals of Bhaj Govindam, analyzing every possible thing, and many more (list is endless) and surely these are gonna be cherished forever. I am sure you are gonna achieve great heights.Thank you so much for making my BITS life all the way more memorable and enjoyable. I will surely make new friends but none will be as special as you are as some people are irreplaceable and you are one of them. Keep smiling :).

<p>I came to know Agam in the second year of my BITS tenure, by way of a group activity, for a course that is best forgotten. What I gained though, was the companionship of a guy of countless talents, and the bearer of one of the most infectious smiles I know of. Agam and I share our roots, and obscure as this may be, we are similar in many aspects. Now I don't whether that was why, or if it was just him as he is, but I was pulled into trusting him instantly. He has the aura of a honest man; honest especially to himself. He likes Indian classical music, and to see how he immerses himself in practice of it, is most refreshing in a world where people live make-believe lives. He loves to sing, and has a pleasant voice; and while hearing him strain it in acoustic endeavor is always a pleasure, it is the handful of conversations we've had, that stand out to me. He just knows how to make a conversation work out: something I've tried to learn from him. Running into him, in the midst of my surveys of our floor was something I always looked forward to, and something that I shall now missâ€¦ just as I shall now miss his comforting presence in my vicinity. Agam, you have the heart to follow what you love. I sincerely hope it works out for you. For the little we've talked, you've given me a lot to remember. Thank you, and may you have a wonderful life ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tuhin-sah">Tuhin Sah</a></p>
<p>Balooni baba.....as his neighbor I always tend to go into a mournful state listening to his songs. A guy with great abilities to go with minimal expenditures and high economic savings in real world applications ( to be simple....a great miser ...:P). As a Telugu guy i refer to him as Agam ga....but he takes it too seriously and starts to sing which taught me great patience...hahahaha who am I kidding. He is a great singer and a programmer. He always tends to be in his own world but gets dragged along by others easily. A very good friend and a lazy neighbor. Wish u luck buddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/j-harish">J Harish</a></p>
<p>I seriously can't recall the day when we met.... but I still cheer it... An awesome singer ( not to say an exaggeration that music is his life)..... who has not taken a formal training... wow... was in drama club as well... an engineer who is singer as well as an actor... the deadly and rare combo... A person really great at heart... (and was really looking great on farewell..)... Honest, and dedicated... these qualities will take you to heights... keep rocking... and smiling.... take care.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>Agam Balooni !!!!! He is not the closest of my friends, but this guy has a charm that I ll carry in my mind forever !Yeah, we haven't hanged out a lot together, like I did with Nishant and Sandeep, but whatever handful amount of times we have met, I can never recollect myself trying hard to make a conversation with him ! It just comes out naturally pouring out of my mouth. That too many of the times they don't even end up being meaningful conversations, but whatever it is, he always seems to get me and with his laugh at the correct pause, makes me feel that he has understood it all ! :) If i begin to explain how much I admire him for his musical talents, I ll just never come to the actual point ! Something that has impressed me the most is the amount of dedication and passion that he has behind it. It is this dedication that has led him to become an enviable classical singer that he is today and you sure have a long way to go buddy!! I tell you, he has improved many folds from the time he came here and I have kinda witnessed it happening ! Ask him anything about music and it need not be classical, it could be english or bollywood stuff as well, he ll be at his best telling interesting facts about them !Agam, you have really inspired me into believing that its never too late to pursue your talents even though you might be stuck up doing engineering :P.. And its not only music that he is good at, he'll surprise you by his debating and drama skills too ! :P.. And I learn from the above testimonials that he is even good at painting and loving pets.Had I been given the gift of some more time, I seriously think we could have clicked pretty well ! :-D
I have truly enjoyed the time we sang together for Janamashthami, especially the practice sessions,trying to perfect the last intricate taan of the song :)( its a different thing that the practice sessions turned out to be better than the actual one :P).. Not to forget the serene atmosphere of the music class where you would mesmerize us into another world with your raags well blended with the tanpoora... Last but not the least, it was awesome fun bitching about the music society in every possible way ! ;) 
You have had your share in my life at BITS in your own little ways and I ll always cherish those memories! NEVER give up singing! Wish you all the success in life ! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gargi-biswas">Gargi Biswas</a></p>
<p>Pehle to yaar.... Great Voice _/\_ His passion for singing cannot be quantified :D All the times he has tried to make me sing... maine sirf sabke kaanon ki band bajayi hai (:S) .. But you used to sing numerous songs in the whole process - and it was just more pleasure hearing you :) Agam being around .. you can just be sure of one thing - the whole hang out is going to be real fun :D The way he would narrate incidences, situations, (and sometimes people :P) ..... would be hilarious !! People pursue hobbies while studying... but i have seen Agam pursuing studies while having hobby as prime part of his schedule! Yet a very inspiring person he is... because he would still come up with most decent grades :P 'Efficiency' and 'Talent' are your assets and never let this spirit go :)  Wish you a very successful life ahead!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
<p>"SINGER" is the first thing that comes to mind when Agam is thought of....Though sometimes irritating, his "classical raags" (ask him what raag means..not me) are very pleasant to hear...especially in the morning mixed with the sound of Tanpura...it's like All India Radio..so, for me, being his neighbour is both lucky and unlucky at the same time I guess...no doubt his singing skills are exceptional(developed in just 2years:the last2) ..he works very hard for that..He's the guy who knows what he has to do in life, works very hard to achieve that and doesn't care AT ALL if that's something different than what normal people do: That's admirable, truly.....Though the part that I consider the best of him is..u can rely on him at the hardest of times(a friend in need) and that makes him unforgettable of course....I'll just wait now, with hopes and wishes...till a day comes when his talent gets aired to the whole world and I get the chance to be a proud friend....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saswat-baruah">Saswat Baruah</a></p>
<p>I still remember my first day on campus and the first person i met.It was Agam,my first friend and still my 'bestest' pals.Well,i had never heard of anyone called Agam before and in case you are wondering,it means 'where no one can reach'.Indeed no one can reach his heights of intelligence,humbleness,politeness.He has great interests in music,literature and pshycology but hates engineering.He is dedicated to Indian classical music and has performed many times in and out of campus.I really admire his truthfulness and dedication towards learning music.He has read almost every classic in the library and you can always find 1 or 2 lying around in his room.A good debator,painter,dramatist and what not!The only time agam studied was in the first sememster;after that he took li8(:P).His unique ways of saying things like 'acha ho raha hai'&'haan..toh main kya keh raha tha?' would make you smile.The times we have spent..unforgettable.The pen glass game,cards,discussing philosophy,roaming goa,restaurants and especially the time when he knocked two glasses(you know agam about that...:P).He is very clear about his future with his plans of classical music and no doubt he will achieve his dreams.All the best and may you not live an average life.:D...  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sagar-deshpande">sagar deshpande</a></p>
