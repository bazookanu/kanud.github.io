<h1 class="page-title">Ahut Gupta</h1><p>Ahut intially got the tag of a ah3 resident than ah4.....the tallest person of our group....this guy is always cool and calm except if someone spoils his sweets in the mess(@chirag)...he always came to my room and downloaded random english songs on my laptop which i always found like weird and pathetic....one of the best moments with this guy was the first road trip of our group in 3-1 ..and then obviously the 2nd trip with only 4 friends which made us witness all kind scariest and funniest situations in my campus life...the accident of the hired deo...and then filling and hiding those scratches using black sketch pen and shoe polish in the busy streets of vascoo..these are some really special memories which i will always long to relive again with ahut and my group...

<p>Ahut.. He was the Ahmedabad guy I met in the campus. He has gr8 sense of humor. He is very cool headed & very rarely becomes angry. I will never forget Vasco trip we had this semester. You will always find him with smile on his face. Long train journeys to ahmedabad & back to campus would have been very boring without your company. I wish you all the best for your future.. Be in touch..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Ahut, possibly the most sane person in our entire grp. I guess you were one of the first persons I met on campus (courtesy Sarang). Its been a wonderful joruney ever since. This guy has got to be one of the most level headed persons I've ever come across and still has a  great penchant for fun! Wish you were here in 4-1 man, would have been able to catch up on a couple of lost sems! (C Mess >.<)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>With the world full of messed up heads, one needs a person who neutralizes or balances everything. Ahut Gupta- First time met this "TALL" fellow standing in the corridor gazing at the sky ,I thought, is this person insane , he had been looking in the blank sky for more than 15 min, then suddenly he  spotted a jet in the sky and that face turned into a world of emotions, his biggest passion : Planes, Jets, Anything that can fly( According to him :P). He is the encyclopedia of aeronautics. Not many people know how crazy this person can get: I can never forget his RAT Stories and Videos, our Ashram trip( first time we all got drunk), Feeding cows with snacks when drunk, our road trip accident( he kept on saying "SLOW KAR SLOW KAR, BRAKE LAGA"): Sorry Bae, Apne Saath tujhe BHI LE DOOBA :P. A very peculiar tendency that he has is: Scratches his head when frustrated and then shouts.During our PS-time in Delhi, I realized how good a friend he actually is. A true and a hardcore non-vegetarian , a music lover, the SAINT of our group, and the one who will never ever hurt anyone. You will always be remembered my friend, all the very best in life . Stay high on life and keep on flying. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aruj-srivastava">Aruj Srivastava</a></p>

<p>One really friendly person in my floor! He's always this highly composed person with a nice sense of humour (thank God I didn't really have to bear the brunt of his PJ wala side :P ).
He has always been helpful to me and has this aura that relieves you of any tensions the moment you start chatting up with him! All the Best in you future endeavours! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>A very soft spoken & friendly person. You can feel the positive vibes oozing out of him. Its always great to talk to him and I will always remember our days in Analog Lab with Tyagi. Always been a great inspiration. We have had our fair share of fun. Its just sad that we are going of PS in different semesters. We would always be friends. May you achieve everything that you aspire for. Best of Luck.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>A cool-headed person and a gentleman is the first impression I had of Ahut when I first interacted with him during my TRW presentation sessions in 2-1. He is a very nice person at heart and very helpful in nature. He is a wonderful friend to talk to and it has been an absolute pleasure working with him during the TRW classes. He is a person who I have always seen smile  irrespective of the situation and that sort of makes the people around him feel good. You have been a great friend and I sincerely hope that we continue to remain the same. The world beyond this college seems to be beckoning each and every one of us and thus I wish you all the luck and hope that you achieve all that you want to.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Ahut, one of my best ENI buddies on campus, i dont know what i would do without him. We have been friends from first semester. He is also my aero buddy. We had lots of fun time together, especially the time when we would go to the lawns to try out our SPAD. One time, he had launched the SPAD and it flew straight at me and hit me. Thankfully it didnt break. We all burst out laughing at that point. This was only one of many hilarious times which we had together. Trips to bogmalo, majorda, and the DOCW outing, all would be so dry without him. A really fun loving bindaas guy, he is down-to-earth and very helpful. Its sad this is our last sem together. Ahut! thank you for your wonderful company. Life would be sad without you. I wish you good luck for your endevours. May u achieve what u desire. Take Care! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
