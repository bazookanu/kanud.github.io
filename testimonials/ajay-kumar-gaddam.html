<p>Ajay.. the witty, thin and tall guy we all know. He has this cool, calm demeanour which I haven't seen him leave even in the most tense of situations. I count this as one of his greatest qualities which should take him a long way in dealing with situations which are to come in the life ahead. I would advise him to not change too much and continue to believe in himself, although some more amount of extrovertism in his character won't harm him. :P I think that he should open up a bit more to the society and show them the wonderful person he is from the inside. :)  I wish him all the very best for his future and may he scale all new heights. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>

<p>Ajay Gaddam famously known as ch!p,gaddam and bus :P.He is one of my best friends in the campus.I know dis guy well from my first year but i actually  get connected to him in my 2nd year.I can guarantee it won't take much time to get to know dis guy and yeah! he won't disappoint or bore u at any time.Many of my friends call him Pro CS and DOTA player but i call him PRO learner.He can learn any thing at double quick time than me and It will take five years to complete my degree if I study like him.He hardly watches English,hindi or telugu movies but every time i look into his computer der will be one french movie saying u can't watch me only gaddam can.I am used to his unique thinking abilities(Once i asked him for his computer's password.He said space(not with characters :P),I was shocked. One week later i asked him again for the new password as the old one (space) was not working.He said space space.Then I felt seriously gaddam \m/  :P).forgot to mention his batting abilities-he can slice the cricket ball with 90degrees turned bat don't give a try, only gaddam can do it..will miss u gaddam :( Do stay in touch,,with best wishes-urs harsha<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nadella-sriharsha">Nadella SriHarsha</a></p>
