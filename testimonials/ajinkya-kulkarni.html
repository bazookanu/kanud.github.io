<h1 class="page-title">Ajinkya Kulkarni</h1><p>Ajinkya. This douchebag awesome motherfucking retard, is perhaps the "bestest" and "oldest" friends I have on campus. I have been fortunate to know this creature since my 11th grade ( owing to the (un)fortunate proximity of our dwellings ) and spent some "quality" time with him under Rawat's regime ;) . Just multiply that with all the hours we spent wasted at Valind and Boga and Bar hopping in Vasco etc etc etc and you could draw a mural. He is the epitome of being chilled out, a thesaurus of epiphanies and ardent collector of the most whacked out shit the world wide web has to offer (to the point of being plain sick :D ). Insanely gifted in languages and un-languages , this guy gives BOB a run for his money and has us clenching our guts begging him to stop his endless tirade of pranks. Jinx this long journey is one I will cherish and remember for ever. Be sure to drop your arse in when you have the time. KUDOS and Cheers.    <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhananjay-deepak-sathe">Dhananjay Deepak Sathe</a></p>
<p>Jinx-funny,chilled out,knowledgeable and smart.Our shared interests include Chodu CID,quiz nights and Dusty-bashing.You would always want Jinx on your good side as there are not many people who can take your case as badly as Jinx(I mean he can really own you).He has also won a competition(involving Dusty) in this regard.King of pun ,one liners and sastas(which are actually good).He is also a voracious reader,a quality I tried to emulate from him but failed(Remember "Running with scissors" and "Trial").Never the ordinary bloke,Jinx also holds a weird perspective of life which includes a mixture of celibacy and one-night stands and also a weird taste which includes sharing pictures of blasted anus or fungal vagina or whatever.Master-quizzer,great in conversation and a handy dancer(with trademark hand-swivels) are few among many things which make Jinx awesome.He might not wear long shirts and fancy pants,but according to me,the coolest guy in campus,hands down.

<p>Jinx ! First of all a big Thank You. Physics wouldn't have been the same without you. The classes we did attend, were fun. You are by far, the wittiest guy I know. Word-play king. Thanks for introducing me to The Doors, Shakti ( Remember the night in my room after POM :D ) and many others. From what I've heard you're also a Twitter celeb. Very eclectic music taste I must say. Its been fun doing stuff with you, Physics, Velino, Bogmalo, taking Sap's case. May the partaay go on !

<p> Times with Jinx are always fun times.Be it him running away at the gate, or going medieval on people,Jinx has a knack for being different and awesome without meaning to. Every instance has been hilarious and memorable - Twitter talks, epic shiz on the internet, sharing music or Bogmalo. He's one of them Freaks and Geeks, and I shall always look back at him as the society-mocking,rum-loving,free citizen. Best of luck with those unfinished New Year Resolutions :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Jinx maze! Yes, that disturbing piece of erotica that we accidentally discovered shall forever stay with us. King of bad puns, I found a true soulmate in sharing bad jokes and worse  sites in Jinx. lemonparty, bluewaffle, rotten.com, futilitycloset - these will forever occupy a place in my heart. An audiophile, you understand my  'eclectic' tastes in movies and music, 'non-mainstream' as they are. There are few things in life as entertaining as a drunk jinx, and his drunk paranoia. We've spent some quality time irritating people together, and when life throws us a curveball, we get down and do the Yeah-yeah! dance. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Jinx- the king of word play.  Internet is the first love of his life. A twitter celeb. Very witty and knowledgeable. Can reduce you to tears, if starts taking your case. One of the very few people who get my puns, however bad they are. His signature moves make him fun to dance with. Very carefree and doesn't give a shit about what people say or think. Just reiterating Ali's point: You are truly the coolest guy on campus.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Here's a guy I who's room I can walk into at any time of the night (not day, since we're both usually asleep) and start a conversation on literally any topic. You'll always find his door slightly ajar, a pile of interesting books on his table, Tweetdeck open on his computer,  and earphones plugged in to his ears, discovering one obscure band after another. Among many other things, we both share a passion for prog shizz, Twitter, bad puns and http://www.thingstodoindelhi.com. His nocturnal habits were a huge help when we had to chase a rat out of my room at 5am.
Jinx is responsible for most of the awesome things I've discovered on the internet, including the finder of awesome things itself - StumbleUpon. His internet addiction is reflected in the fact that he always seems to know of every meme before it goes viral, and always has something interesting to share when you enter his room.
Also, having Jinx as a member of backstage during Music Nites was always reassuring, for you could be sure that atleast one thing wouldn't go wrong during the show!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
<p>Jinx has to be one of the 'kewl'-est people I've ever known. His knowledge on various topics is as astounding as his comic timing, and his love for Delhi. We've spent quite a few Bogmalo trips discussing the most random and bizarre topics, and it has never been boring. Dance is one his many talents and no one can forget his trademark dance moves that he flaunts once he's got his mojo on. Epic dance steps are epic. He has also introduced me to some very interesting music, and the song 'if you come today' owes its popularity in campus to this guy. All in all, Jinx is guaranteed entertainment and a great person to hang around with. Oh, and the quintessential athlete. Lets have that terrace reunion party we've been thinking of soon!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>Jinxy ! He's the only person I knew before I came to campus. God knows why i never chilled with him back in school, but every moment spent in college with him has been absolutely hilarious ! 
He's definitely the one person who can understand apna tapori-ness the best. Almost everything that comes out of his mouth becomes one of those 'most used' phrase in our daily lingo. I will never ever forget the "Yeh sab log kya tamepass karrele tyutter pe" status (I'm not sure if I got it right word to word, but Tyutter was enough XD).
He's one of the people I visited Bogmalo first with, and I would not have had it any other way.

<p>Jeeenx aka bluffmaster! :P I got to know Jinx a little late during my time at BITS and i really regret that now! Jinx is truly one of the coolest and most laid back people i know! (in a good way!) His wit, presence of mind and spontaneity is something that everyone has witnessed first hand. He tells a great story and always has something incredibly hilarious to share! Jinx and I took an EPIC trip to Bangalore which shall not be forgotten in a hurry. Be it bogmalo nights, twitter handles, YEPIC comedy nights or just random discussions, its been bloody insane knowing this guy. Lets hope this time next year we're discussing realty in Bangalore for PS II! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>"Yeh banda hai bhai, Yeh banda hai". Jinx is this funny , sociable (especially when drunk) and happy-go-lucky guy with impeccable taste in music. He introduced me to Simon Garfunkel, Dead, CCR and co, and for that i'll forever be grateful. Jinx also holds great promise as a singer, his version of the Bohemian Rhapsody has captured many hearts. (and a bucket) Drunk Jinx is the most epic person on campus, and together we've had great times may it be  velino,  epic nights at bogmalo, bangalore trip, nightout at marine drive or the buddhu boss nights. Jinx is a tyutter celeb, a master of double-meanings and also a budding musician, "Par is baat ka inhe koi ghamand nhi".  Yeah banda hai bhai, yeh banda hai!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Jinxad! " bhai one of the coolest guys in the campus. He s done it all . My partner-in-crime for sooo many different case-taking sessions.He s up there on the top. Has a shrewd sense of humour which is deadly,and with that quick-wit he can really fuck your case( ask dusty, sapra, pranky). Addicted to the net / DC / twitter. An explorer from d random videos to the cocky sites. I dont know how he finds them. From Chickipedia to stumbleupon and what not. awesome company . fellow mumbaikar likes to travel. Bhai CHD is on where you will be able to unfold the true meaning of existence, the birthplace of our great mentor/GURu *AB* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikunj-sharma">Nikunj Sharma</a></p>

<p>I don’t know anyone on campus who hasn’t heard about Jinx and his shenanigans (many of which I partook in) or isn’t in awe of him. He da man yo. Arguably the coolest guy on campus, except AB – as I’m sure he’ll agree. Our friendship is based on the cornerstone of a common love for classic rock – particularly, the Doors, Pink Floyd & Queen – and merchandise related to the same. Of course, over the past 3 years shared interests in videos showcasing the biggest retards in the country, the danger bhangra & desi spiderman dance, word games, twisted humor, live concerts, Old Monk binges & psychedelia have formed additional pillars of support to sustain the most epic friendship ever. A true partner in crime if there ever was one. On an aggregate, we’ve got into (and out of) more trouble than anyone else we know. From getting lost on Bogmalo (me) to epic getaways in high speed pursuits from the gate (Jinx), to run-ins with wardens (both of us) to instituting ISABCON we’ve done it all. And, it’s been incredible fun. He’s the undisputed king of one liners, spontaneous humor, twitter trolling and Bluff (the card game, six kings yo!). His taste in music is eclectic (and frankly, quite brilliant) to say the least. Never one to shy away from experimentation, he’s discovered and shown me some of the most awesome things the internet has to offer – ranging from the most disturbing stuff on reddit to the most awesome songs I’ve ever heard on soundcloud. He’s one person who can sustain a conversation for however long and comes with the guarantee of entertainment. Simply put, Jinx is one of the most loyal and awesome friends I’ve had the privilege of having. I hope I continue getting his pings at random times of the day, with his latest ‘dafuq’ thing off the internet, for the rest of my life and, with AB’s blessings, he goes on to become an accomplished sound engineer to improve the condition of music in this country. P.S. Use an umbrella fo drizzle. Not shizzle. That just wrong.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>To the guy in"mere saamne waala door";To the randomness he brings to the table;To the ES1 night where it started all; To the night canteen sessions we had;To the lousy Velino's trips; And to an awesome neighbor; To the twitter non-stop bakwaas ;  "Jinx! Aap Dude hai" ( Hopefully sishir doesnt get offended :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>Jinx! easily one of the most fun and easy-going people on campus. His sense of humor is just plain brilliant. One of the most knowledgeable people in backstage and has a hugely extensive musical taste. He's also passionate about drumming and has good solid skills. The admirable thing about is that he only just cares for the stuff that he likes and works hard on learning them. I'm sure you'll become the best in business in whatever you do!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
