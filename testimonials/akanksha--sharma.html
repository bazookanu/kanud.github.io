<p>Kind, caring, full of warmth, smart and fun loving are the list of Akanksha's qualities. She is very loyal, honest and trustworthy which makes her a great friend. She is brilliant (ultimate fodu) in academics. She is always ready for trips. The funny part is that she is scared of dogs especially the small ones :P. Her dedication and hardwork to academics will surely take her to heights. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>Akanksha is a very homely, lovable person. I have known her from Bansal classes Kota and since then it has been quite a journey. All those study hours together, struggling through the stressful life in Kota, N.V.Sir's Coaching, and then BITS has bloomed our friendship. Her dedication, hardwork and sincerity will surely take her to great heights. Wish u all the best for your future. :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Akanksha is person who is very clear about what she does. Being a bright scholar right from her childhood, she has carried that legend to the college and continues to do well in acads. She  is a loyal person, loyal to her duties, her passions and herself. She is very hard working and has a rock-tough determination. On the other face of the coin, she is a fun loving person who cares a lot for her friends. You would love to sit with her and gossip for hours. Most importantly, she is sensible and a lovable human being. I wish her good luck for her future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>
