<h1 class="page-title">Akansha Suneria</h1><p>Akansha .. the shyest , the one engrossed in novels (hope there is a word for it…replace the phrase with it n keep reading ahead :P ).. You are one of the most practical people I have met.. (practical + fun loving ) . M really lucky to have a close friend like you.  You are a perfect blend of hospitality, focus ,passion and duty. This makes you all the more adorable. I shall really miss the shy Akansha of mine..who would miss her meals sleeping (Sona :P ) and then long for Cheese pasta from Nescafe.. whose immediate plans after exams would be some good movie which would be \m/ in fast forward mode. Straining my mind over our first encounter.. comes the tsunami memory :P ..  and we have never ever stopped to amuse each other since then .. our friendship has been through several twists and turns and still rose up triumphantly which makes the bond all the more stronger. And hence the probability of it lasting forever grows high :) .  I will miss all our conversations , explorations and walks to monginis.. (mine n your coffee speed :P ) .. Your practical advices have always motivated me. Time spent with you are some of the memories I will always cherish .  Wish you all the best for your future .  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>Sweet, innocent, honest, hard-working, maths pro, dedicated, well all these qualities can be together in only one person and that’s Akansha. She has an impeccable dressing sense. If you want to watch any movie or read any sort of novel, she is one person you should go to. Not an exaggeration, her criticism of a movie is on par with IMDB. She is class-a-par in maths, Hats-off-to you sweety... She is a complete movie-freak, anime-lover and has a classic taste in novels and at the same time, amazingly great at studies. She is a great person and a friend to whom you can look forward in any scenario be it advice about dress, food, movies, novels, studies, etiquettes, friends, life or anything. One thing that many people don’t know about her is that She is an amazing dancer.
 I recall the days when I wasn’t well, it was you who took care of me, called my mom and did everything, sweetie you are a true friend... Our group, those stupid talk, gossips, love, affection, ‘shweta’ ki lagaana,  our long discussions, morning walks and everything, I am gonna miss it all, Love you yaar... take care ... :)

<p>She is the sleeping beauty. Needs a nap before breakfast, lunch, dinner and then she  won’t step out without setting her hair and perfume! A big fan of make up and dressing up, she is like a delicate, conscious doll. Also the laziest person I have met, but we still manage to drag her along with ourselves wherever we go. Anything out of her world is NAMUNAPANTI and NATAK for her. She loves watching TV series, listening to all sorts of music and has read more than half the novels in the library. At the same time she is focused, sharp, hardworking and dedicated towards her studies.  Also a big fan of food. Somebody who seems shy in the beginning but is rocking once you get to know her. Very soft  at heart.  She is like the innocent kid in our group :P.  Its fun having her around and we just love irritating and picking on her! I remember how I used to keep texting you in the CAS classes if we couldn’t get seats next to each other. Will miss those giggles. And the India Fest with you in the 2nd year was just awesome!! ( you know why! :P )..Somebody whom I constantly go on asking about the next year cdcs and who keeps relpying again and again without getting irritated. Has given me loads of support and help when it came to studies. I will miss all the late night talks (about anything and everything  ;) )and gossips we have had in our rooms. Love you loads Akansha..take care..will never forget you ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>

<p>Akansha is my go-to girl for,well, anything! whenever i bunk my lectures, which i do with a thorough regularity, in my head I'm thinking about her and cant help a lazy grin. oh where would i be  without you? shes always sleepy, always supportive and always opens her door with a smile.
my lab partner in DECO.  Wasnt that one wretched jinxed lab? not one proper output, but we managed to laugh at that too. i remember we took turns to treat each other whenever we got a single output. sweet memories! will miss you a lot! bye.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>
<p>Akansha very quite , introvert and shy girl. i wouldn't have even met here if it was not for "workshop practice ", my first lab partner in in bits (1-1). It is always nice to talk to her , always refreshing. She attends attends all ENI CDC lectures i believe that has a got a lot of patience.  
Best of Luck for all your future endeavors , hope we stay in touch!! :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ananya-singhal">Ananya Singhal</a></p>
<p>Akku...!!! As I call her !! Oh.. GOD ! Your first impression on me in the first year was.. " she is such an annoying person who keeps on studying.. bah..another ghissu.. , eh ?? :( " But now !!  I love you !!! The past two years have actually made our friendship grow from strength to strength.She is intelligent, caring, helpful, irritating (Sometimes), worried about studies (always) and one thing she is best at is SLEEPING !! Call her up and she will be like.. "yaar abhi main so rhi thi, 5 min me mess chalenge, kyun utha diya ?? " And you would be left zapped counting the number of naps she takes before going to class, after coming back from the class, before going to mess, after coming back from the mess !! Oh god !! I remember the 
meeting we had in ps1 and I came to see your PG.. You showed me the circuit you had made..it was amazing and indeed overwhelming to see the cute little smile on your face when you showed me the same..it all reflected the amount of hard work you had put in to make that !! I sat with you there and we talked about anything random and you showed me all your pics of India Gate !! I would always cherish those memories "akku" !! I love your dressing sense !! :P A focused girl who knows what to do when..extremely decisive and sweet.. :) I wish you all the very best for a bright future ahead...Stay in touch always !! :D
