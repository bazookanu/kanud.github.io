<h1 class="page-title">Akash R Bellubbi</h1><p>The person whom everybody admires....who in my opinion could be a potential film critic....trust me he watches a hell lot of films....a "phodu" in academics....leaves me awestruck when he tops the course after coming back from the exam saying "i got screwed"....my badminton buddy for the past three years...some good times we had there in the badminton court didnt we?? :)......not to forget all the great movies that we watched together during lazy afternoons....when we had nothing else to do!remember the movie marathon...1 day six movies during spree 2011 :P ?

<p>The "phodu" of the group. His hardwork and effort for success is just exemplary. Dedicated towards his goal and fun loving when in the mood. All in all, just the right package :)  ..  but over all a great friend to have and an equally good person. All the best mate :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Well I will rember this one as Bellu. Someone once said, all great thing come in small packages. This little dynamite we have here is a testiment to that very fact. needless to say and as the other here have iterated, this guy is academically  stunning, and i own in varying degree to the marks I have salvaged in assignments and other such requirements towards which I have no inclination or idea or knowledge, to him. I do not happen to be all that close to Bellu, but from the limited  interaction I have had he has a great attitude , helpfull as hell and a great guy. I wish him luck in wherever his life may take him.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhananjay-deepak-sathe">Dhananjay Deepak Sathe</a></p>
<p>Well, time has come to walk through the lanes of past and cherish the times I have had with our beloved "Bellulli" (means garlic in kannada, for those who are not aware..). I'm sure I cannot place on records in a few words, our relationship and the camaraderie I was fortunate to share with this buddy of mine. Nevertheless, I shall try my best. This guy is arguably one of the finest managers I have ever seen in my life, one who has mastered the art of playing with life and extracting the best out of it. The way in which a leisurely, lethargic movie freak extrovert transforms himself into a full fledged nerd weeks before the exam and switches back thereafter, is something way beyond my understanding and imagination.  Dude, its perhaps something you and ONLY you can do..!! Hats off! Believe me guys, if you were lucky that this guy happened to be in good mood, you'd have thoroughly enjoyed his company, as I always did ;-) All said, over these years we have shared very good times and I strongly hope we continue to do so :) 
All the best for your future endeavours Bellulli, and thanks for making my stay at BITS-Goa memorable.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>Akash Bellubi...what can i say...the glue that holds the whole group together...a brilliant mind, a caring and hardworking nature, and an extraordinary laugh ( i can hear it as i write) defines him...a very vibrant personality its always entertaining to have him around.... i had him as my lab partner for the last two semesters and got to know that he s also a great singer :P ..him being one of the few vegetarians among us, one thing that i need to mention..i really enjoyed the debates we had on "paneer is not chicken"..great times...to sum it up a great guy and a fellow EEE survivor..i really wish you all the best for everything ahead...its gonna be awesome for you !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-deshpande">Aditya Deshpande</a></p>
<p>If you have sharp ears then you have heard his laughter atleast once during your graduation :D. Well , that itself tells you what a happy nature this guy carries around, and not just carry he passes on this happiness with everyone around. Its amazing how he can assess and describe each movie he watches and u can be rest assured he watches everything. He has this awesome eagerness to learn about new music and appreciate it. Talking about happines, movies and music have i told you he also scored all the 10 pts u can get in 1 semister ? Versatile is written all over him , he draws huge respect for that . A man with great values ,which are generally lost when you stay in a hostel but not in him. With your extremely sorted mind and nature all you can do is touch the stars . cheers :) !  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-das">Varun Das</a></p>
<p>A laughter that frightened everyone, a face that's loved by camera lenses(yes I mean it..!!!), an extraordinary and really humble personality is something that Akash Bellubi is NOT all about, there are many more to it!
In terms of Chemistry, he forms ionic bonds with all his friends.
In terms of Physics, His 'relative' assessment of exams deviates hugely with ours!
In terms of Maths, he's the Integration Operand, which integrates and unites the entire group into one
and in terms of CS, he's a "10-->" ....It was really a pleasure knowing you!!! God Bless you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>He was my Communication System lab partner. He is smart, intelligent. It was fun to do boring commys lab with "very advanced equipment" in the lab.. He is a gr8 singer too.. He always comes with new song every week & sings same song throughout the lab.. I wish you all the best for your future!!  Be in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>a movie enthusiast.. any time i go to his room i see him watching some or the other movie. If I feel like watching a movie, he is my suggestion book. Goes unsaid that he is a "pro" in academics and his humility is limitless... I still remember the semester in which he used to see others' marks and call them "godlike" and in the end he himself ended up bagging all 10 points. A practical, cool, smart and a cheerful person who is very helpful. Wish you all the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Need I add anymore adjective?? After all for what other people have already said about him.. no i don't. But being my neighbor, its my responsibility to comment something more than what others have. I am very proud to have learned one thing till now, spell his name properly (three years not wasted...) "Bel-ld-ub-bee".. hope this is the right pronunciation. For those of you who don't know Kannada, no need to understand what i wrote, for those of you who know, just be happy and contented with your knowledge.. :P. Well, as far as his academics are, everyone knows that he is the only person, who is a 10P, and yet cannot be called a nerd.. ('nerd' was never an option, for his nickname). The only person who even after getting full marks in a subject does not have even a faint sign of happiness (totally indifferent to the situation). His extra curriculum includes watching movies (and rating them), playing badminton, chess, table tennis, (i hope you improve ;) ). Nevertheless, I always enjoyed being with you, even though you do not appreciate my jokes, I do.........not appreciate yours too (why should I?!! XP ). Being a very diligent person, he always manages to excel in his work. I have learned a great deal from him about his attitude towards life. Not like other persons, who are equally talented as him are as down-to-earth as he is. I not only hope, but am very sure, that you will succeed in whatever you do. God bless you for your future life. Be in touch... :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyesh-shrivastava">Priyesh Shrivastava</a></p>
<p>He is hard working, intelligent, smart, witty but above all a very good human being. On face value he may appear as someone who is very fussy about academics, but his liking for movies and his vast knowledge of excellent novels, is just amazing.He is Intellectual and someone with whom you can have a quality discussion. Wish you all the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>
<p>You're an awesome guy with lot of +ve energy around.. Its said that this guy can score well above av even if he don't go to classes and start preparing a night before exam. A true talent, again one of very few who loves EEE... Being in EEE and loving the subjects even after teacher like Nitin Sharma deserves respect. A great guy with a lovely smile and helping hand.
Best of luck for your future dear, it was a pleasure to know you personally.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Do I really need to write a testimonial for you. I mean, I can summarize everything there is to know about you in just two words.:P ... I guess that is the difficulty of writing a testimonial for someone you know so well ( it kind of feels stupid) .Anyways, here goes nothing. The smartest guy on the planet.period.Biggest movie buff I have ever come across. Awesome attitude towards life and towards others.Almost a foodie.He is an awesome friend to have around...... okey now if you have stopped smiling , then its time for the truth. smartest guy ghanta ,fucking mugger,ghotu.Movie buff toh tu lite hi leh , pehle hindi movies dekh, I mean who the fuck watches korean romantic love stories :-/ .And attitude my ass, fucking always keeps laughing live a modern day rakshas. On top of all that , you are a vegetarian.Okey the last part is still true... great friend to have around.Great memories we have had , that this stupid box is too small to share ... adda,movies,outings,NC but the most memorable thing has to be "120". My best wishes for your future.
P.S. ... I told you .. "You Can't Handle the Truth"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritesh-ranjan">Ritesh Ranjan</a></p>
<p>Bellu..I gave you that name...I don't know if you are thankful to me about that but I like it..It suits your small, chubby frame..which btw is a complete contrast to hugely brilliant mind of yours..Your brilliance knows no bounds..I can never think of having that kind of focus and discipline that you have for your goals..Whenever I try to remember you the picture of you with your ass nailed to the chair, eyes glued to the screen watching some crappy movie will first thing to strike my mind..Your double-kick has always been a treat to watch...The only irritating thing about has to be your laughter...A great guy and and an awesome friend that you have been there is no doubt that you are going to be successful with your endeavours..:)All the very best..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>
<p>One of the good guys around who still has that enthusiasm for the any question any time thing, never is ou of mood for some kinda puzzle or such stuff, and i daresay i really love such friends, and also hes one of the very select few of such kind i have met in this college

He is a clear example of the proverb 'When the going gets tough, the tough get going' , by optimising his performace just before the exams and not staying in front of books always like a nerd. I surely know our friendship is gona go a long way ahead, i wish him all the best in his life.

Good luck mate<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>
<p>Bellu!!.. a very hard working, one of the few most studious students i have seen in campus. He is always in a jolly mood and ever-ready for enjoyment (his laughter is an epic one! :D) but for him, that enjoyment also includes studies... : P He is one such person who is never tired of studying 24hrs continuously (maybe he loves his chair alot!!). He never loses his patience and passion, thats one thing i admire most. Apart from studies, he is good at badminton, TT and lately cricket. (Hope u soon hit-on “five” six”es in “six” balls to win ur match ;) :P). He loves watching movies/tv series.. u just name it, n he will tell u reviews about it!! Even after 3yrs in this campus, this guy has never moved on to mcs, bcs... :respect:. He is very humble, caring, dedicated, down-to-earth person. Always ready to help n give u company for campus rounds! ( i m gonna miss that man!!). he also loves gifts n “supriases” (if u know what i mean :P). Btw he is _/\_ of EEE. I m sure, if u keep it up the same... u can “craasss” any road u will come “acraasss”.. :P. Wishing u luck for ur ensured bright future!! :D. It was really awesome time having u around!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nilesh-bhala">Nilesh Bhala</a></p>
<p>Akash Bellubbi, also fondly called Bellu is phenomenal. This guy is a perfectionist. He has an insatiable thirst for knowledge, a relentless desire to compete and improve himself, an involuntary obligation to excel in anything and everything. He is one of those rare people who have hardly changed in these 3 years in hostel. He has still not embraced cusses as part of his vocab, and maintains very strong ethic values. He is incredibly intelligent and humble, and sure does know how to laugh. He laughs so hard that is can actually be heard hostels away :D. He is a foodie, a huge movie buff and in his own words a connoisseur (in various fields). He also has that knack of nonchalantly phoduphying every exam. He was a ftp in 2-2 with subjects like CAS and MUP. He will return from an exam maintaining poker face and a disappointing voice stating he got screwed, and yet when results come he'll be among the top most people. He has hardly ever gotten Av- in any subject. He studies his subjects not just to score marks but to understand the concepts. He goes to the core of the subject, nerd saala !! However strictly speaking its only the week during the exams that he has the nerd-mode activated. Other days he is a much more fun-loving guy, and can be seen(rather heard) laughing even on silliest of the jokes. He is a mighty-jolly person. He also happens to be a walking database of movies, and random bits of trivia. He has a delectable taste in movies and I believe he has never watched a movie with IMDB rating less than his cg (which is over 8.5 :P). 
<p><p>
Here's a toast to the infinite amount of time spent in your room, having those lengthy discussions about the life the universe and everything else; to all the movies watched in your room; to all the times you taught me those silly subjects; to all the "naan-sense" maan; to all the praasperity; and to all brilliant experiences shared together. Will definitely miss you man. Lucky to have a friend like you :).
<p><p>
P.S : I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. <i>(You know which movie this quote is from)</i><br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
<p>There is so much to say about this guy, thati actually dont know where to begin from...........well to begin with, he is undoubtedly one of the most hardworking guy’s i have ever met..........i have seen him for 3 years sitting in that same chair for hours on end and ‘raping ‘ all the subjects,so much so that i am simply in awe of this guy..........compre’s are conducted exclusively for this guy to top the exams :P...............but he is not at all a nerd.........his taste in movies and books is brilliant..........in fact he has watched so many movies and tv series that whenever i want to watch anything, i go upto him for suggestions.........a very caring, humble and down-to-earth person..........has a great sense of humour and also takes jokes very sportingly............his  ‘ho gaya teraaaaa’  dialogue has always had me in splits :P............he has a unique laughter, which actually makes every one around him laugh (even if you are 2-3 rooms away : P)..........he is the kind of person who will achieve anything that he wants to.....given his hardwork and ‘never give up’  attitude..........all the best for your future!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-verenkar">Akshay Verenkar</a></p>
<p>He pings me two days before the exams and asks me the syllabus, a week later he innocently tells me he has aced everything(well, more or less) and its just another day for him. The thing about Akash is, he is very headstrong and pursues things relentlessly. And while he is at, it he can be awfully cold and indifferent (I’m not taking that back, it’s a testimonial and it will be wholesome :P) and he sure means business when he intends to. And in a way, I admire it more than I can tell. Then when he is his charming self, there is that empathy which sharing the same mother tongue and culture does to people. I taunt him as a nerd every once in a while, but we both know that’s neither here nor there! Actually, it’s more than that, it’s a paradox the way he shuffles between nerd and anti-nerd, shifts his mental gears somehow!?
In the retrospect, it’s not one or two ways in which he surprises me. He is in fact full of them, I had no idea he can sing, for instance.  Mr. Bellubbi is a pot full of awesomeness, it won’t make sound because its full, but it will overflow nevertheless!
Heres to the one and the only guy who makes me feel incompetent in every way possible and still stays in my good books! All the best for your future! And stay in touch!

<p>Akash Bellubbi, I guess I was the first victim of his patented 'kannada test' back in the beginning of first year, and ever since it's been a wonderful journey. This little guy can be found watching some movie or the other, keeping his room's doors open all the time. I guess he has completed the entire IMDB catalogue during his stay here. An energetic, fun loving person, this guy can somehow manage to ace all his courses (read: manage straight As in all) while still watching movies 24x7! How I wish I was like that!! And still, nerd is something you just CAN'T call him. Will cherish all those movie nights, the endless conversations of home, bangalore, and karnataka in general, conversations at 'the bench', and the awesome road trips down south (something I consider far better than anything I've seen here, in Goa, Yes.) Thanks for being a part of this wonderful journey here at BITS and making my stay here all the more memorable. Do keep in touch, and all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pavan-agnihotri">Pavan Agnihotri</a></p>
