<h1 class="page-title">Akash Sharma</h1><p>I met you at the beginning of my 3rd year and since then I've always considered you as a great friend of mine. You've always been a great support and have always provided a helping hand while preparing for exams. You're someone whom I respect a lot. Keep the good work going n best of luck for your future endeavors..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Akash Sharma! My sidey, who is irritating yet sweet, who never let you get bored. He loves singing and is best at dancing (Your Audi performance :P). His devil laugh is very popular in AH4. Yes! I know that you and Neeraj has something going on, but lets accept it (and move on :( ). Its fun to be with you and with his nature, he always makes the atmosphere around him very lively. Remember the fun we had at every road trip?? Those would have never been same without you. I can spend hours chatting with him. He is dynamic by his nature and by his actions also.  I wish you a great future (at light wali shop or as sarpanch, peepal ke ped ke neeche or as professor).  Wish you all the best!!

Wait for those two "dil se" wali lines ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sagar-birla">Sagar birla</a></p>
<p>I know him from the very first days of my BITS life. Although from his appearance he looks like a cute little naive kid but he is a very cheerful guy and is really fun to be around. I hardly remember a time when he didn't had a smile on his face. He is very helpful by nature. He has always been of great help whenever i needed him. I'll miss the amazing times spent together (be it sethia's lol classes or zephyr dance performance). Good luck for future pongoose...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>We knock, a sound comes, “Wuoooaaa”, we cant make out what he said, we knock again, another sound comes “UUUnnnnhhh..”, we still knock, and a battalion of such sounds follow, finally u give up hope and leave. In the evening, he tells you, “saale, doosri baar uthaya mat karna” and when u innocently ask “y but?!”(that has another story in itself), he makes a face which would make u feel ashamed of your existence on this planet , and say, “subah kitni baar bola chaleja, khatkaye jaa rha hai Ch#$%yo ki tarah!”, and u are left wondering how in the world you were supposed to decipher that “grunt” code, but then follows a detailed explanation, which makes no sense at all, but is full of “Oiii”, “BHAMM! (that’s my personal favourite :P), “Dhudumm!”, and every other chirp, rumble, snort you can think of! Welcome to the world of Akash Sharma aka Pongus aka Pandit aka Bachha. Senseless, yet simple, innocent and beautiful. He lives in his own world, and he is always right! He might not have heard half the discussion, yet, he is right! If he is not, then you will have to answer an array of questions which end only when the answerer concedes victory :P :D He is the entertainment of the group, always very exuberant. Logon ko irritate karne ki jimmedaari isi ne le rakhi hai, taaki duniya mein kisi ko dukh dard ki kami na mehsoos ho :D Aur saala irritate to aise karta hai, peeche hi pad jaaye, chhode hi nahi. Now that’s one side of akash, which he shows to the world. However, within this rather over hyped shell, lies a mind which is really calm, extreemeely sensible, honest, humble, loving and caring. He likes people, and thinks about them, but doesn’t show it much. Loves to portray an image that he is fodu, kabhi ki de dega apne mein, khel lega apni, par saala bahot bhola hai. Kabhi kabhi to dekhkar jealousy hoti hai, itni simple life jeeta hai. Har cheez feel lekar karta hai! Cricket premi, bhale mujhe kabhi out nahi kar paaya (khud pehle ball mein bold aur ho gya! :P) He is also very intelligent and hardworking, kabhi than leta hai kisi cheez karne ka to macha ke rakh deta hai. Khane ke shaukeen rahe hain ekdum, Cheese ka nasha hai (NC mein khud ki style se khata hai Cheese Dosa) aur sarpanch ke ped ki, hospital ki, hindone ki, Alizee ki, 2 rupye ki tamatar ki chutney ki baatein ekdum passionately sunata hai.
Personally, he is sumone who has curiously amused and inspired me since a long time, from Suroth, an extremely remote area, banda bahot fight maarke yaha aaya hai, bahot badi baat hai. No complaints, yaha aakar zindagi ka “chaska” nahi laga kabhi, bas hasa(“Eeeehuhahahahaha!”) aur hasate raha sabko hamesha! Gajjab banda hai! I still remember 3-1 ki T2 jab tune mujhe padhaya tha, tera bahot syllabus bacha tha fir bhi, only becoz you had promised me so when I had to go home urgently, aur koi bhi choo cha nahi ki thi! For that, and for being that one, jiske paas aakar mere saare tension gayab ho jate the, “E THENKS HA!” Bas mast rehna aisa hi zindagi bhar, aur haemin bhi apni chhatrachhaya mein rakhna! :P :D

<p>Pongs, tere liye toh 'do testis' bante hain. When you started with us, I was like, who the hell is this guy, he doesn't even speak. But when he opened up, once he started talking, we had to literally stop him. He is pure fun, can make you laugh any time. Everyone loves pandit. Academics me bhi phoduuuu, EEE cdc ke /\. Nite canteen lover, or should I say cheese lover. He is always game, would never say no to anything. Irrespective of the topic, he's always straight about his view, which is sometimes irritating. Baccha and Saccha. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sagar-birla">Sagar birla</a></p>
<p>He is that one toy I would like to take home with me.  Happiest, Funniest, cartoon, mood lifter, liveliest, childish, joker, hardworking, dedicated, enthusiast are some of adjectives that can try to describe him. He has like maximum names on earth (most of them given by me :P).Starting from the very first ,“Goofy” then “Pandit ji” then “Ponga” then “Pongoose” then “Chotu” and many more of them. In first year he was this cute little shy  guy in our corridor who told me “ yaar tum log jab masti kara karo tab bula liya karo”, but little did I know that he will be so much fun once he opened up. You opened like a soda bottle, once open can never get back (coudnt come up with anything better :P) . There are some guys who have a good sense of humor and will crack jokes to make you laugh , but  akash’s (naah pong’s) presence only is sufficient to put a smile on your face and jab ye joke maarega to khud hi apni trademark monster hasi hasega and mostly to log joke pe kam aur iske hasne ke style pe jyada haste hain :P.  He has an amazing style of telling stories with all his original soundtracks( like dhaammm!! Budhummm!! Dhuiiinnnn!! /\). If Disney has 100 soundeffects in all their cartoons then this guy can create 101 sounds easily. When he is around no one, absolutely no one can be sad.  He is literally the lifeline of our group. I cant imagine our corridor without your constant kilkaari (hihihaha), your exam ki raat ko 2 bje hatne wala cricket, your exuberance, seriously you are the one who kept everyone’s spirits high at all times. He has a tummy which completes him without which he woudnt  be so dear to me :P. Everytime when he is able to defend his tummy from my constant hitting he says in his own style  ” betaaaaa!! defence hai tagada”. Problems? he doesn’t know that word, because when he has a problem, he will just open up to someone and then forget it afterwards.. He has one of the most genuine person I know and has a pure heart. He never cribs about anything and simply cannot stay sad for more than 5 mins, whatever may be the reason.  He has a simple and clear set of funde for life and they will take him a long way. I cant describe in a testimonial all the awesomeness that you brought along with you but I will miss you ,miss your style of waking me up( yelling nnnrrrrjjjjj nnrrrrrjjjj :) ), miss your silly questions , miss your “HAIN” followed by “KYA” and lots of things. And as they say in soaps “ hamara pongoose to gehna hai jahan jayega khushiyaan batega :D “ .Good luck for all your  future ambitions in life ( machate rehna ). Just stay as you are “a sweetheart”  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neeraj-singh">Neeraj Singh</a></p>
