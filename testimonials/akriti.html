<h1 class="page-title">Akriti</h1><p>My first friend in BITS! 
An epitome of politeness and simplicity, Akriti  is the perfectionist  in our group. Be it her notes, her room, her cupboard, bookshelf, expenditure diary(omg!), she is so inhumanly organized. Professors’ favorite and extremely hardworking. 
On a personal note, she is the one with whom I have spent the largest part of my life here.  The study sessions, the missing home sessions, the food longing sessions, the oh-so-important advice sessions, the fight resolving sessions… the list goes on…. An avid listener and an ever supportive, ever helping friend. I am lucky to have met you. PSI would have never been so fun, but for you. Just shrug off the li’l pessimism and nobody can beat you… love you loads. Keep smiling, always! :-)?

<p>Akriti... Its hard to describe her!! Her simple and sweet attitude easily makes her the most likable person in our group. Anyone who doesn't even know her are aware how shy, sincere, hard-working, intelligent and helpful she is. But something that people don’t know about her is how funny she can be… how irritating can she be at times…. And also how sarcastic she is!!! She coupled with Poorwa make an excellent pair pulling my leg over almost everything possible under the sun. I know u loathe this… but I love u loads!!! U have been one strong pillar of friend all my BITSian life… stay like this the way u r… sincere, honest, trust-worthy, sweet, patient and the list just goes on… Wish u all the best for ur life (even though I know u won't need it :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankita-mahapatra">Ankita Mahapatra</a></p>

<p>akriti....perfect example of how faces can be deceptive...when u see her for the first time, u can think of a sweet, shy, sincere person, which no doubt she is...but hidden behind that aura of calmness is a mischievous little girl, who can come up with umpteen no. of crazy ideas....(remember kinu's bday??) her notes r \m/....1 number ki phodu hai... even though i havnt known you for long, its gr8 fun being with u....all d best in ur life.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-aggarwal">Megha Aggarwal</a></p>

<p>I don’t remember exactly how I met her first time, but when you look at her for the first time you would come to know how very very good girl she is. In these last three years, I have seen her change from being a very very good girl to a good girl. She was very shy when she first came here, but as we all became friends and lived so long together, the naughty part of her came out which I was so happy to see…You cant bear someone being so good!! I have seen her getting up early habbit changing to getting up late as a result of night tp part of bitsian lifestyle. we have had so many after dinner walks singing and making fool of ourselves with poorva,her  and ankita. She is a very responsible girl and hard working too.. During exams ,if you could not figure a thing out and you had aakriti having common course with you, you just need to go to her and all the problems are automatically solved. She is a brilliant girl and you could always find the notes of all the classes that should be laminated and made a bible for all the people taking up any course she took!!! I am sure she will do good in anything she takes up in future.. Will miss you …too bad that we are here in different semesters next year.. stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khayali-jain">Khayali Jain</a></p>
<p>Akritii!! A perfect daughter,a perfect student and a perfect friend :) She has an amazing quality of perfectioning everything she does. It surpises me how she manages to be so composed in every situation.She would always find something gud in everyone and i have never heard her badmouth about anyone. Somehow she fails to realizes how gud she herself is.She would underestimate herself for so many little things but believe me akriti u hav so much potential that u can excel in anyfield u put ur hand in.I had an awesome time with u these 3 yrs.Remember i gave u those liqour chocolates nd den ur reaction was sumthing dat should hav been captured :P I remeber our compre thermo paper when we stayed up all nite and were still nt able to complete d syllabus.I remember u cryin fr dat nd now look at you after dese years :) ,it has been an amazing change and all gud :) Whoever thinks u r calm nd quiet ,should come to ankita's room and listen to ur chirpy voice and ur jokes which have improved a great level i must say :) Amonst all dese u still manage to b d same akriti and i love u for that.Thanx for being dere all the times and listenin to all my  random bakwaas. Thanx for everythin akriti!! i know success has to follow u wherever u go :P !! but still all d very best :)

<p>Akriti...the epitome of sweetness and nicety I should say...from what I have seen of her in this past one year of classes together and studies Akriti is a very intelligent and hard working girl. She is also a highly obedient student I must admit....when she listens very attentively and follows every instruction of the professors to the T.... Akriti lives a very simple life and sometimes it makes me wonder how can anyone live life in such a simple way with less complications and less demands from oneself. Although she is a very good student...she has always been very confused about what to do in life....I believe that is quite expected of good students like her for whom there are a whole range of options open. She has a lot of patience which is quite evident when she is studying...especially when she reads each and every line of the chapter and even the portions that will not be coming for the exam...Although we often have the same amount of portion left to be completed before the exam and I crib about it eventually completing it before her...it is she who at the end of the day manages to study the portion well...I totally respect her for the kind of person she is...Akriti can never remember important dates especially people's birthdays and also people's names even if she has worked with them before. Our group studies will always remain an unforgettable experience for me when I incessantly laugh at some small stupid thing throughout the entire night before the PDD exam and to which Megha and Akriti would comment the next day"Jab bhi Sneha itna hasti hai hamaara PDD paper bura jaata hai" :P Although her first impression might be that of someone who is very sincere, hardworking and serious as you get to know her you realize that although the first two may be true but serious nah!!! that she definitely isn't. One doesn't have a clue about the amount of random bakwaaas Akriti can engage herself in while we are studying and becz of tht we have never been able to complete our portion on time although we manage to eventually complete it staying up late. She is very polite and can never get people to do work, always respects teachers (unlike some of us :P) and always has greets you with a sweet smile. Her humble nature has never failed to amaze me. Akriti, it was great knowing a girl like you, there are loads to be learnt from you...however we have always failed to imbibe any of your qualities into us. We are fortunate to have a friend like you so helpful and caring and fun to be with. Hope you achieve great success in life (and do Krishnaswamy and Manjare Sir proud :P). Wish you all the best for your future :) Always stay the same and keep in touch wherever you are :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>After knowing her I realized that God has created some people who are so near to being ‘perfect’.I just don’t know where can begin with talking about her ‘perfectionism’, where do I end?I can talk about that all day…I have never seen a person as hardworking, sincere, patient and organized than her, she is a girl that can be said as an ‘ideal’ child for any parent. I know her from my TRW class but the time spent with her in my third year will always be memorable.  She is a very helpful, sweet, soft spoken and a charming girl, can never say ‘no’ to anything.  Now, these are the things that everyone knows about her….yes,this is Akriti as the world knows her. Getting to something that people do not know about her..she can talk a lot sometimes (even when we have exams and lot of portion is left). Will never forget the PDD time,where we could never find a reason to our staying up consistently till 4 am before the exam or the KRD time where we never stopped cribbing over the not-so- long  assignments which we never started on time … she is so good at pulling others leg ( love the expression on your face after it ;) )….I really wish that you scale heights ( and I know you will )..you have defined “perfectionism” in a all new manner for me- “YOU’..had so much fun with u...hope we have fun next sem too..:):) ??<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
