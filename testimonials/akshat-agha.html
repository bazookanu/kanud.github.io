<p>In one word : Dedicated.

Akshat Agha is one of brilliant minds, I met in BITS who also devotes enough time to studying and as well as Sleep. Both being equally important. :P He is dedicated to what he wants in life, and achieves it with ease.

In next ten years : probably a professor or scholar, and yeah happily married.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritwik-seshadeo-sahoo">RITWIK SESHADEO SAHOO</a></p>
<p>All he does is studying, sleeping n talking to his girlfriend. He is one good friend but almost useless :P.  

He is a child which every parent would want to have, gets good grades, doesn't do anything without asking parents, and you can imagine the rest......

I don't know what he will become in future nor I care, but all I am excited about is attending his marriage, because..... " Its our secret"

And yea one more thing......his grand-mom makes awesome food :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>cheater hai !! he copied my grades for 3 sem back to back!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-bharadwaj">Aditya Bharadwaj</a></p>
<p>My first impression of Akshat was that of dedicated,studious aka perfect material to be 10p. Now that i know him for 3 years, i can say he is certainly serious about his academics but his first priority are the people close him-family,suki bhabhi and his friends!! Sleep,Food...be it anything all comes next to his dear ones. Apart from this he could be very lazy sometimes.
My best times with him were when we used to do the countdown to holidays during depressing compres:-D 
I am not sure what he will do in future(even he isnt sure about it) but one thing i am sure of- one day he will definitely buy an Audi :P. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-bharadwaj">Aditya Bharadwaj</a></p>
<p>Lakha, that's what we call him; the reason being him hailing from Lakhimpur :D. A very hardworking guy who wants to just excel in whatever field he's in. I guess he had his goals clear to excel in Mechanical Engg when he got into BITS and that's what he's probably doing right now. An awesome friend to be with and a very caring person. We've had many ups and downs in our journey, but we just can't stay without each other, can we ? I don't remember how many times we've traveled Goa-Mumbai and the other way. Be it train or bus, the long route was always made fun to travel. In the coming years, whenever traveling to Goa, I would miss you and the awesome journeys we've had yaar. I know it for sure that he's going to rock wherever he'd go. Stay the same. Have a wonderful life ahead. And as Gujju said, I'm looking forward for your wedding :P Cheers ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Laakha,the Automobile guy of our group,is one of the very few people i have come across who believe in mechanical and are actually passionate about it-be it workshop,thermo or fluid mech.Tthose who think he is a mechie at heart,they need a reality check, those who think the first priority in his life is his fucking asshole idiotic maniac tharki freinds then they too need a reality check-his only priority for the last 2 years or so and for many more years to come is bhabhiji and no one else..and the sorry soul doesn't dare change his priority or else he is screwed :D.Jokes apart,it feels so good to have such people around who care about you and one day become one of your best buddies.From the 'chudaap phelane waala' time spent in his room to shortlisting prospective girls who should be made friends with and helping me to find my true love(:P  :D) to coping up with my changing true love every sem his room has been our brainstorming centre for these things all these years.You have earned the scaiittissst's love and respect :D...papa ka aashirwaad tumhaare saath hai...bhabhiji ko mera pranaam<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>Lakhimpur ke Agha Sahab, fondly called Lakha, has been a source of constant inspiration for all to go to all the classes, get good grades for all the mortals around. People around him remain amazed at how he manages to get such high CG, even when he spends about 23 hours a day talking to his gf, hamari to-be-bahurani. He has a heart of gold as he is a really honest, humble, caring and down to earth person. And not to mention the tehzeeb he brings in his way of talking from the land of Nawabs, where he belongs. He has been at the core of all the chudaap we have done in all these years and yes his room has been the main brainstorming chamber for meticulously planning the next chudaap which would rock the community around and the world at large. All this said and done, his love for mechanical engineering and automobiles is simply unparalleled, there is a saying which goes like this, "one does not simply mess with lakha on the matters which concern anything which moves on wheels". His love for the products of german automobile industry also goes without mentioning as it went as far as taking a german language audit course just to feel closer to the german culture, the hotbed of the best automobile engineers. _/\_ This man, I am tellin' ya, is bound to do miracles whereever he goes through his sheer hard work and work ethic. My wishes and blessing(:P) are with him!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>

May u have a bright future..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>In one word Akshat aka Lakha is a true friend with whom you can trust with anything. He is a hard working and intelligent guy who has his priorities very clear. One thing that i really admire about him is that he never panics whether it be giving unprepared exams or any other situation of crisis. He listens to your problem as it is his own and at times gives very logical solution. His work ethics are commendable and once he is committed to something he gives his 100 % without any regard to results. I know that one day he will certainly buy a Ferrari and work in some automobile R&D department. Wishing you all the best...  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-pathak">HARSHIT PATHAK</a></p>
