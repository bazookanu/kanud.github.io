<h1 class="page-title">Akshat Tiwari</h1><p>Akshat aka Ra1, truely, THE MOST LIVELY and JOYOUS person I have ever met in my life!! He is genuinely genuine. If somebody has to learn how to live a life, he is your teacher. Brilliant sense of humor, really intelligent, cozy nature and a wax heart are somethings that this gem is all about. In short, Ah5 will not be Ah5 without Ra1... I am really grateful to have you as my neighbour....God Bless!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>What can we say about "Ravan" nick says it all.One can't find a person having more evil mind than he has.All he says seems like some sarcastic comment which you wont understand unless you are in his close circle.There is no count of how much times he has competed NFS or watched FRIENDS but he resembles to me more like "Joe" .Another cool dude of the campus have nothing to worry about and nothing to come in its way.His blogging skills are simply \m/.To be honest if our corridor felt so lively then "Ra1" has a major role to play.Wish u have a gr8 life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>

<p>Words cant describe Akshat Tiwari aka *RA1* aka "Shaitan Khopdi of Campus" . Whatever your mood be , this guy will cheer you up. He has been one of the close friends for past 3 years. A very good person , helps you out whatever the situation be. Had some great memories with him , All those outings, trips to GoKarna  and whole of Goa were just amazing !!  Generally he is very helpful and caring person but dont meet him when he is drunk.  You just can not control him ( IndiaFest night :D ) . We have very special friendship and will be in touch for sure. All the best for your future :o) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swapnil-saurav">Swapnil Saurav</a></p>
<p>Came to know him because he was in my Lab group. Coolest person I have ever met. He has a lot of knowledge of automobiles.Though he was my lab partner for a semester of two we did very few experiments together as he used roam here and there even outside the lab during lab timings. His blog is quite good I and like to read it. He is a good comedian and as rightly said "a guy with a devil's mind"... Don't stop enjoying your life..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Akshat, truly the shaitani khopdi of our campus. Talking to him always lightens up your mood. Be it suggesting each other movies, novels( mainly i was the one asking for suggestions) or having serious conversation on bringing in the change in the society or any other topic, have enjoyed each one thoroughly. He narrates to you an incident in the most amusing way possible which will surely make you laugh. Be the way you are. I wish him all the best for all his future endeavors and i hope you bring in the change which you wish to see. Keep blogging!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>
