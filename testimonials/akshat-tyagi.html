<h1 class="page-title">Akshat Tyagi</h1><p>First time in my life not using Control + C and Control + V: p Sirf Tere liye Dost!!
To be frank he deserves much more than this, Kya kare hum lazy hai! Akshat, he is ever ready and enthusiastic to chill out and to have fun; any day, any time. Always highlighted in the group for being lively, charming and friendly. Har pal aise jita hai jaise ki aakhri ho :-)
He has very good view of his future, Mere sath milke business jo karne wala hai ;-). Dude I will enjoy your partnership. You are one of the very few real JAKKAS people of BITS. Baki sab log sirf bolne keliye LITE hai :p Wish you a fantastic and glittering life time.
