<h1 class="page-title">AKSHAY P  BARAPATRE</h1><p>well known as "bara"....he is one of the most talented and intelligent people of EEE i've met on campus. his knowledge of electronics is just _/\_. give any electronic gadget, and he will figure a way to get it working. he is very proud of being from dombivali and is an avid lover of modern day bikes and cars. 
he was my LOP partner and i also worked with him as event manager in quark'12. he successfully handled all the problems that arouse and made sure that the event wasnt affected by them, and at the same time, worked for open showcase. a workaholic indeed!!
also, he doesn't miss any opportunity to show off his knowledge and skill in front of everyone when possible, but a good and simple guy overall.
He and abhijit joshi are a team that fodufy every EEE CDC. they are 2 very sincere best friends.

<p>To be honest, I have rarely met anyone else in my life who has a more carefree attitude than him. His upbringing has made him a really independent person as compared to others of his age. Ever smiling, his curiosity for understanding things is great. He is a true geek, his knowledge in electronics is immense but has few interests which include bikes, cars and movies. All in all, an extremely fun person to hang out with and someone whose attitude will definitely make an impact on the way you lead your life. Wishing you all the best for your future :)

<p>It is still sort of difficult for me 

to remember his first name at times, 

considering that his surname and its 

corrupted derivatives have almost 

completely taken over his identity. 

Bara was probably born with a 

resistor in one hand and a capacitor 

in another, given his keen interest 

in any circuit which comes under his 

nose. Probably the lightest (not 

litest) member in our group, he never 

ceases to amaze us with the sheer 

amount of time he takes to forage his 

way through his meals. He's a gem 

when it comes to mess-table 

conversations, and some of our 

loudest laughs and lolest 

conversations have been usually held 

in his presence (the one on 

Mahabharat and Ramayan was epic!). 

Can be easily crowned the Gossip 

Queen of the group, considering all 

the stuff he usually wants to discuss 

:D He has been a constant and 

entertaining company in most of the 

indecipherable CDC lectures that we 

need to tolerate (analog springs to 

mind). Prides himself on getting late 

for every class, and somehow boasts 

about his 'feats' for days. One great 

thing about him is that you can 

always count on him to give honest 

opinions, which are almost always 

rational and well-thought of. 

Appreciate the fact that he keeps 

himself aware of the stuff happening 

around him. Extremely helpful at all 

times, he has been a rock-solid 

friend for all the time that I have 

known him. He will be running away to 

PS next sem, so he is one person who 

I will sorely miss for the rest of my 

time in BITS.

<p>Bara is the GOD of Electronics. The ultimate phodu in acads as well. Proness_Personified is not just his nick. He is a genius. His ever smiling face & his helpful nature make him a wonderful personality overall. He's a very professional person. I m sure he has a very bright future. All the best Bara !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>Barapatreji !! dont go by name he  never used  to give party...PJ apart.. He is a big  cry baby and an electronic freak. I think he is a small baby to whom if you give a small toy ( in the form of aurdino or any electronic circuit ) then he can spend whole day playing with it. He is extremely helpful person. Will never forget the help he gave me during Jaundice break. And  not to forget, he is a nerd. (no comments on it !!! ) All the best for your future and do stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saikat-mitra">Saikat Mitra</a></p>
<p>Bara, Party, Baraparty..hardly anyone uses his first name (or his actual surname). The fact that such a situation has developed tells a lot about how friendly Akshay is. A fellow EEE geek and a very talented practical electronics enthusiast, Bara is ever ready to learn new things. He is one of the few who has a very patient ear for all the gyaan I dole out in no little quantity :P. He has a very inquisitive and sharp mind, a combination which has helped him achieve quite a few accolades in his time here, be it CDCs or a unique event for Quark'12.
Having one of the loudest laughter around, he has, quite a few times, made heads turn :D . 
Looking forward to PS together in Bangalore (hopefully). All the best Bara!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
