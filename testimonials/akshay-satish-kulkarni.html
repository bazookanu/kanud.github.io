title: Akshay Satish Kulkarni

<h1 class="page-title">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</h1><p>I met Kulkya on my first day at BITS. He talked to me as if he had known me for years! Now talking has always been one of his strong points :D--< Then we had many classes together in the first sem- and he had a talent for getting me into trouble (with his childish innocent face, he escapes the Prof's radar). Kulkya can say anything without the person on the receiving end getting offended- his manner of speaking simply takes away the seriousness from his words! Another point. He is a marvellous mimic.Simply amazing. He can imitate you, right from the tone of your voice and facial expressions to the way you walk,hunch your back, twitch your nose....He has never refused an Ashram invitation-his love for good food and chicken surpasses everything else. He is a truly multi-faceted person. Like a chameleon, he can adapt and adjust to almost anything. He is also a  'Vijay Raaz' Kauwwa biryani fan.. All the best, have a bright future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>I've known Akshay for a while now,we gave the JEE together(lol :P), the BITSAT together,in his words, we've been oppi's for 3 years now. Honestly, I've never seen so much enthusiasm in one person.He always gets excited for the tiniest of things,be it cricket, football, tennis (massive Sachin and Federer fan! :respect:) or even the girly gossip flying around the campus!(thank Mrinmay for that). This guy is a walking encyclopedia.He knows everything, and I mean EVERYTHING!.He always has a positive outlook towards life.He goes about everyday in his own way, singing songs loudly(sometimes annoyingly :P),childishly teasing Alok or Mudit, loling on TV shows(huge fan,huge!) or swearing at people in the left(your left :P) corridor. Always gets up early,does his chores, goes to bed at 11 sharp.I don't remember him missing any lectures.Ever. But even if we are oppi's in every possible way, we are best friends and we always will be. Hope you have a long and successful life, or just be immortal like Kenny!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>

<p>I have known 'kulkya' from the 'pakya' days . He is a very friendly and witty person , the first time I met him felt like I had known him for years . His sporting attitude is what makes him so likable . He is never offended by what anyone says . He is a connoisseur  of TV shows , especially sitcoms (Arrested Development \m/) . He is also a huge tennis fan and a football fan( he knows about football history like mrinmay knows about food  :P) . He is also the 'emoticons' guy of the group , finding a 'kulkya' facebook status/comment without a :P or a :D is impossible. Holidays mark the beginning of 'tagging session' for him , where all the semester photos are uploaded and tagged meticulously. Another one of his special skills is mimicry . The 'aaaaaaaaa' for aniket is his brainchild. His ability to mimic other's voices is unparalleled(esp paritosh's voice). ACADS-wise , he has the brightest future ahead . Already equipped with the lethal duo of Physics-EEE , he will most probably end up in CMU/Caltech/MIT . I am lucky to have a friend like you and wish you all the best for your future!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>
<p>This guy is one of those people who are referred with appending a "ya" after their names... "KULKYA".. A complete talk-a-holic ... If you are a total stranger, he goes on chatting with you as if you have been introduced to him long back... And from the next time you meet him,,,, Oh my...!!! One who loves to talk and talk and talk anywhere anytime any moment....( Sit besides him in class and off he goes with his stories.... !!! :P) A cool guy to hang out with... A person who makes others burst into laughter by his witty jokes... !! An expert prankster I must say... (Likes to fool/tease people... :P though without offending them...) A genius person who is a complete hard worker but takes things in his own style... Always relaxed... I have never seen him tensed up or anything... A person who maintains the news of each and everything... You ask him about anything or anyone on campus and you've got a lots and lots to hear about from this guy... :) Probably the Gossip King on campus :P...A brilliant chap and an enchanting friend to be with.. I am glad that we met...  I hope you have a successful life ahead.. and you'll make wonders... . Live it to the fullest... Keep gossiping. and teasing people..... :D :P Nice to have you as a buddy... !!! All the best for future... :) Enjoy...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>He is a lot of fun to be around and is easy-going....  a very caring person and is genuinely interested in what is happening in your life. He is a practical, level headed person who is very good at judging people. He can stay strong and doesn’t lose his temper in any possible situation.
Sometimes he irritates me with his never ending list of questions. I never understood why he enjoys that.
I value his friendship and know that he would be there for me any time I need someone.  
He has got passion for life… for people....and yeah… for animals too….!
I wish him all the best in life and hope he gets all he wants in life .... :)

<p>Akshay. First impression. Back in 2008. A geek, self obsessed, arrogant nerd. (I have a point, wait). We had commont tuition classes right since 2006. Yet never became friends. I really don't know what happened in BITS, but the 5 minute phone conversations on 'Who else from M Prakash got in into which college' got converted to 20 minute mess table conversations, and soon these conversations descended into our rooms, and man they last for hours sometimes now !! Me and Akshay can talk on any topic for almost any amount of time, may be because we share the same views. I dont know. The best facet of his personality is his bluntness. Man !! You feel kicking this guy in the nuts at first. But no. It this bluntess that is alloyed with honesty and being frank. Akshay is almost an open book. He is one of the most genuine persons I have ever seen. He is very perseverant and is well informed on movies and novels. He loves his parents quite a lot, (we all do, but this one loves showing it off too. Again, genuineness in personality I reiterate). Another point worth mentioning is his ability to judge people. He can just see right through your face and your heart and your mind, and judge what your intentions are. So, beware, never try to fool him. I wont be able to imagine my life without him being around, because he is this pillow that I like to punch and  stab with my problems and anxities when I am distress. :P . With that thought on my mind, I will just say, I will Akshay a very problem-free and anxiety-free life. Keep smiling !! (PS : It is not cool, what you do. Putting boring proverbs and ideas as Gtalk Status Messages. Stop it)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mrinmay-milind-kulkarni">Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Akshay one of my first friends on campus .He is very jolly and fun loving person ,always carries a smile on his face .We had studied for the first two years together and he had made it a lot more easier with his stupid jokes and sense of humor.He must be one of the very few persons on campus who gets up early and have bath daily early morning and comes to breakfast with his hair combed :P.He is a pro mimicker he can mimic anyone varying from Shibu Clement to Fungee .He has a true passion for electronics and loves working on breadboard. Eating chicken fried rice and watching most of the sports(tennis,cricket,football to name a few)  are his favourite  time pass. His self confidence and ability to bounce back from the worst situations is what i respect the most .
All the best  buddy :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raman-ladda">Raman Ladda</a></p>
<p>Akshay Kulkarni or Bachcha as he is known is a funny guy. During exams all of us would be running around stressed and then he would come and give a tidbit of gossip (this man loves that) or some other ridiculous quip and BAM! Insta-stress buster :P. Plus did I say he can be really funny with his accurate imitations and general humour. Another plus point about this guy is that he is always calm and talks with you in such an innocent manner that even when he tries to insult you, you end up laughing :P. So there you go, I wish him the very best of luck and hope he has a great road ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>
<p>Akshay is always great to talk to, never failing to make us laugh, the Funny Guy who people often ask if I'm related to, due to our common last name. Even though we're not related, I'm glad to have known him as a friend with a heart of gold, although sometimes I want to whack him on the side of his head for asking too many questions! :P His jauntiness is infectious, and his unceasing banter a real stress-buster. It's great knowing you, and I hope to cherish this friendship in the years to come. All the best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Kulkya or Akshay whatever you call him is the only student in BITS who takes a bath daily and that too in the morning. The first memory of kulkya that comes to my mind is he coming for breakfast after a fresh bath, hair combed neatly with proper partition and a wrinkle free shirt or t-shirt. Laughing is the best medicine they say and kulkya has taken that very seriously. According to a survey conducted by me and Modak on kulkya, he laughs with a frequency of 5.7 laughs per hour! He also loves reading a lot and also aces in playing the keyboard. Keep that laughter rolling :) all d best for your future !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>I met akshay ( there are many people like me who call him that...the nickname was made in BITS) in IIT coaching class , and was thrilled by his mimicry skills. His speciality is that he mimics the person he talks to ( we used to roll with laughter when he used to talk with Psunay :-D) He is a genius  and good at everything he does. He is also the Vice-President of IEEE _/\_ . But he's the kind of guy who is never tensed inspite of a huge workload and continues to work smoothly and elegantly.  Akshay never fears to speak out his mind and also is never ever ( you just cant make him angry!!!!) offended no matter what people speak. Apart from being all charming, he's my major source of gossip. He keeps track of everyone he knows (including what they are up to). Akshay is also a die-hard dog lover and has an awsm dog( most of us are scared of him...especially nakul :-)  ) . He is in general fond of pets also.  Akshay is also very fond of emoticons ( sumant mentioned this...bt i felt it needs some extra emphasis :-) ) . Ok...and I have to accept, he can do my mimicry as well, a feat few can achieve _/\_ .  One more speciality of his mimicry is that the masala he puts is extraordinary (  the "cheeeap cheeeeap cheeeap cheeeeap" song you made with aaaniket's voice :-D ) . He is also a  wikipedia when it comes to G.K. and also a history enthusiast.  I am sure he'll achieve great success ( he was always a genius !!!)  All the best !!!  :-P  :-)  ;-)  :-D  :-))  :-8  :-x<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-gote">Paritosh Gote</a></p>
<p>Kulkya. I dont exactly remember how we became friends, but now I can say, I'm sure glad we did. The first thing you notice about Akshay his charming and affable nature. He is very amiable and fun loving and has this wonderful sporting attitude. Very talented, Akshay is also an extremely hard working guy, and manages to pull off things most smoothly. Akshay is passionate about electronics is sure to ace the CDC's next year. Apart from that, Akshay and I have many common passions, the two most prominent being our love for food (misal) and sports. The guy is simply mad about all sports, be it cricket, tennis or football. I can never have a dull moment with this guy, simply cause we have discussions for hours on end about our favourite matches! I can vividly recall our discussions on Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Garrincha to name a few!. He loves sports trivia and his wikipedia knowledge, now, almost rivals mine. ;) Akshay is along with Aditya and me, is a frequent Ashramer and we always have a good time there. And I have to mention that Akshay also absolutely love misal (When are we next going to Katakirr?). The guy also has my number, when it comes to betting. Hope we always remain friends. All the best for your future, mate! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ameya-karambelkar">Ameya Karambelkar</a></p>
<p>That day I was talking to someone in mess. And we started discussing about kulkya. He asked me “After some years do think you’ll stay friends with Akshay?” And I said,”Always”.
Akshay is very systematic, jolly and always a fun to hang out with.I knew him from  before  but became good friends with him after  coming here. Endless mind-blowing  discussions over tv series,cricket,books  and other topics over the years will always be cherished by me.
He's one who didn't sacrifice his meals for mess food and always was a companion in going to shahi and nc(CFR!).
I wish you all the best for your future!!!

<p>Yo Kulks! I share the last 5 alphabets of my surname with him #justsaying :D
This sweet and forever smiling guy is a fun person to be with. I have always had a great time hanging out with him. We share the same interest in tennis and he believes that Fed is the best!  (hmmpph!!) -> We all know who is-> Nadal - with whom I share the fisrt 3 letters of my surname with :D #justjustsaying
He is someone who does well in his studies and yet doesnt seem like the nerdy kinds. Alwyas smiling and jolly, Akshay is one of the sweetest boys on campus.
Stay the same, Kulks! Don't ever change!

<p>I met Akshay in the first year as one of the first people in my branch and till now we are such good friends. I know I am a little strict with him but I want him to be better with everything he does. Its a great experience to work with him. "Kulkee" and "Bong" are some my favorite nicks for him and I enjoy calling him that. I just wish that at least now, he takes less tension than he used to. As everyone has mentioned above, he is a big fan of NC and Shahi. One of the best mimickers I have ever seen in my life, which made the IMA labs a fun event. I wish him the very best for your EEE CDCs next year and success for all of his life. Once a bong, always a bong :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>I got to know this guy better only in the third year(Physics CDCs..:P), but from then on it was a wonderful journey. You can always count on him as a good friend, attends classes(but sits on the last bench)and writes notes and hasn't said no to anyone asking his notes. He is an amazing character and shares everything with you. I egret not meeting this guy on my 1st 2 years. Always remember the assignment sessions( especially MMP) , combine studies for stat mech, nuclear project etc etc. he had been there with me for the sufferings which physics faculty gave us and i am happy that he will be there for EEE cdc also.Looking foward to next sem to spend more time with this great guy and do more insane stuffs. All the best for your future, which he is sure to have without my wishes also..:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>Kulkya!! I have known this guy since my +2 days. Used to hang out in college for a little bit too, but I really got to know him when I came here. My first thought when I heard he was coming here was "What the hell is Kulkya doing here?". Not many people know that he was in the top 100, in the FIITJEE Open test. 
Needless to say, this is one brilliant person. Really really brilliant. He amazed me in the first semester by pulling off a seemingly impossible B in Maths-1. Since then, my respect for Kulkya has only grown. The Vice President of IEEE folks :). Usually the target of my cheap jokes, I have always gotten fitting replies from him :D. An outstanding mimic, he is the only person who managed to actually irritate me by doing my imression over and over :D.
For that, and a lot more, thanks mate! Good luck, EEE god, your year is coming!
P.S: Thanks for lending me your can of Mortein so many times :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>Akshay is one of those people who can just start speaking to you, even if he has just met you. Fellow dog lover, he is one of the people who will support me in the “German Shepherd’s are different from Alsatian” argument against Aditya (doesn’t matter what the net says :P). Extremely cheerful, I have never seen him without a smile on his face. He is also a very good mimic. All the best for the future! I am sure you will do great!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>I met Akshay for the first time in BITS. He talked to me as if we had been knowing each other for years. He is a very friendly and cheerful, talkative person and always carries a nice big smile on his face. He can talk about anything with anybody anytime!. He knows about anything you name( KULKYA la ati chawkashya karaychi phaar jasta saway ahe). He is a huge fan of cricket. He can speak volumes about the game. He is an excellent player of cricket, carrom and cards. He likes to watch Marathi movies and songs. Akshay and Aditya were the only people who used to be awake early in the morning to have breakfast in A mess. Akshay also has excellent mimicry skills. It is fun to watch his mimicry of Shibu, Gupta and many more. He has done a very good job as the Vice President of IEEE. I wish you all the best for your EEE CDC's and your furture! Always keep the bright big smile on your face alive!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>A very simple guy. Simple at heart, actions and thoughts. And i have always been of the kind who thinks that... "All the good things in the universe are simple and the converse".. You personify that. A child at heart...  Gets tensed at times :p.. Always takes things sportingly.  Always Happy and spreads happiness. Thanks for all the memories.. I remember that you are the first guy i met on campus.. Remember that?(at SAC)... Benchmate in all the EMT classes , and all those perfect imitations of  our professors and Rachit and who not? Thanks buddy :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>"Kulkarni Akshay Satish " was a name i used to often hear  from harshal  and ofcourse in physics classes some 4 times a week (very distinctly :D)  , seemed like a very shy person then :) but yeah thanks to IMA and optics i have now noticed the quitessential funny witted kulkya in him :) His insane jokes in the IMA lab and tricks  left me into spilts ! He seems a little carefree but this IEEE office bearer is an EE god and is all set to show his prodigy next year :) I am sure with his steady going demeanor he shall make it big !

<p>kulkeee... I don know what to really say about you. Have known you since first year. got to know you more during the CDCs.. often calm, at times irritating. Nothing really seems to affect you much and you still carry yourself the way you always do. Dedicated to your goals and hardworking as well. Your sense of humor is pathetic at times but you still manage to crack a few good ones :P Overall it was nice knowing you mate... All the very best for future... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Akshay and I were benchmates at "THE KALE's" .Akshay is a cricket fanatic and most of us consult him for past cricket records.He follows tennis with same passion as well .He is a very calculated person and plans out very well.His general knowledge is comparable to Jimmy (:P). Akshay always has interesting topics to talk about may it be real life, ancient history , politics or sports.Akshay has a good sense of humour when it comes to people :D supported by his mimicry skills.I wish you all the best for your next year , I hope you achieve all the success you ever desired in future,<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prathamesh-dilip-gaikwad">Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad</a></p>
