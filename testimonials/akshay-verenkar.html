<h1 class="page-title">Akshay Verenkar</h1><p>Mr. Dependable, a true sportsman and  the biggest fan of Australia I've ever seen. Cricket and Australia run in his blood, and he lives by the Australian-ism philosophy (single minded determination to win). He's also a bollywood and reality shows aficionado. He enjoys almost all of hindi movies, not to mention the tidbits and rumours going in the glamour world. These may seem cliched phrases/adjectives but I'm gonna use them anyway for they fit this guy more perfectly than anyone else. An indomitable passion everything he does/likes/believes in, an eternal love for the Gentleman's game(Cricket) and Australia, a never-say-die attitude, and the fuck-all attitude when it comes to Australia are what set him apart from other people. He does tend to be whimsical at times, but is truly a great person at heart. Here's a toast to 
our friendship, the unforgettable moments, the underarm cricket and all those sastas. 
<p>
Cheers, eh mate ||

<p>Akshay, one of my dearest friends. He is just amazing, apart from his passion of sports, specially cricket which is well, there for everybody to see. He has a lot of other qualities too. Despite his calm and humble self, he has a very strong presence and is someone whom people won't like to disturb and make him angry :P. Something that goes unnoticed is his reasoning abilities and the way he carries himself. The way he laughs at my jokes is simply awesome, it makes me feel so good that yes, even i can crack decent jokes and make people laugh like that :P :D. But all in all he is just a great guy and a great friend. Talking to him, hanging out with him is just a pleasure always. With us both being B5A8, I look forward to spending one more year of hectic CDCs with you mate. And may be this time you will let me get better grades then you :P. Just kidding, ob you are gonna be far better than me. Just keep going mate, I just get this feeling that you are the one whose life is gonna change the most after college and for the better of course. :) all the best and god bless :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Akshay personifies calmness, discipline,simplicity and amongst many other things cricket! He is truly the Mr. Cricket..His passion for the game is unbelievable..HIs knowledge regarding the game is great..When I first came to know that he supports Australia I just couldn't buy it ..How can someone from a cricket-crazy country like India support Australia..It was something which I was seeing for the first time..Apart from cricket he is a good orator and I like the way he narrates something..His love for Bollywood is worth-noting as well as his liking for Himesh Reshammiya..He is never has any doubts about something he believes in and always stands by it strongly..The way He carries himself around is admirable and commands a lot of respect..Man you have been a great friend..All the best for the future:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>
<p>One of the first guys i met on campus and since then he has been a great friend.The one thing that really bonded us was cricket. He is among one of the finest cricketers i have played with and his passion for the game is just amazing!! He deserves to star in any playing 11, for apart from skills, his love for the game is something that truly stands out. His knowledge about the game is staggering and he can recall any match, player,score in a jiffy. I can go on writing about him and cricket, but there are many more qualities that define him.He is very humble,caring, helpful and is someone who'll stand by you always.He has a very individualistic stand on things and is unfazed by other peoples opinion on them.He is a meticulous organizer and has done brilliantly each time, whether it be organizing the hostel league at the smallest level to being the event manager for cricket in Spree 2012.Akshay, you are someone whom i have great respect for.I have enjoyed each and every moment with you and hope to spend many more. wish you all the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>
<p>I never thought there would be a bigger cricket fan than me.And then I met you.A great cricket player,follower and organizer.I could also add an almost unbiased cricket follower but then I remember Australia and Chris Gayle,for completely different reasons from one another. I remember the first match of cricket we played together and I was captaining. You came up to me and said you wanted to bowl, we were winning by a huge margin so I guessed why not :P .... I saw your Bret Lee like action and then the ball wizzed past ... boy was I surprised."Pocket Sized Dynamite" I called you that day :). A great leader on the field and a great motivator. You always bring the best out of your team and you have always led by example. Your love for the game is unparalled. It was a pleasure playing with,against and under you.Those AH5PLs , those underarm games, the CP games, the way we managed to play behind AH6 .... some of my most cherished memories. So good were those days that I never felt the need to return to my primary game. Apart from cricket, I know you are rocking Physics and will surely rock ENI with your work ethic. You were always the first person who came to mind when I was in any sort of mess :) :P . I hope we still have time in my last sem to have atleast one day of CP cricket .... Chears!!

<p>If I remember correctly .. we met for the first time at the Carrom board..(we were a team playing against Gautam and Ramu ...)..From that day to today...my respect for u has grown exponentially...the way u carry urself...the way u r passionate about cricket , the way u give ur 100% no matter what the situation is and what a great leader u are...A huge fan of Australia  and  has written a set points defining "Australianism" in his room (I think u r Australianism personified...) and also Hindi movies...The first person in the group who started the use of the word "Godlike" ...Great memories we have had ...But the best one...BY FAR ...is when I and Parth were at the mess...and u came and threw the book on the table and said "Sunil Kumar ki Maa kahaan hai??"( I shall refrain myself from writing  ur next sentence here... :D)... Feels  proud to have a friend like u.. and All the best for your future endeavours.... :)

<p>"children's park at 5 " .. is the most common mesg i have got from him . With akshay its all about cricket . Its amazing how one guy can eat,sleep,talk ,think only about cricket =D ! You'll often come across millions in India who claim they are the biggest fan of cricket ,but then they haven't met chotu :D .Aks ka toh sharir bharat mein hai par dil dimag is all Aussie Aussie . He gets a touch emotional with that , but thats what it takes to stand by your beliefs  Apart from cricket , simple and sensible are the words that describe him exactly .He is just so polite and always sports the good behavior (off the field only :P) . Any plan that has to be decided we have Mr.Dependable do it , and great thing about that is he takes into consideration each and every idea that comes from others . A great organizer , with Spree cricket,Slam,Ah5pl  among the few tournaments under his credit . He carries huge respect from the hostel and i am sure he is going to go a long way through his life with that respect . Cheers man ! have a great life ahead =D ! .  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-das">Varun Das</a></p>
<p>Akshay aka Chotu aka Mr.Cricket... best friend of mine in this campus. First of all, i wud like to say that, never go by his physique... he can beat u up twice before u will know whats happening to u!!(well, it just got a bit filmy.. :P). He has been a pure entertaining, fun loving (especially his killer PJs... those wud literally kill all of us!!) multitalented, most caring, delightful person in this short stay. He is very hardworking, be it for studying or for his supreme passion for cricket!! He is the biggest sportsman i have ever encountered in my life. I m envy of the passion he possesses in tons, for his play of cricket. He is a person who keeps his words n is very tough at his commitments... believe me u never wanna bet with him in the stats of cricket!!!(rather tr8 me with that money :P) He is truley inspired by Salman Khan.. (in case of commitments :P) you can never change his perspective towards anything..( it will be like sharing food with Joey or a winning a debate with Sheldon Cooper, one of his recently fav characters!! :P) He is very cool person until and unless u have some extensive chats involving Australia.. (u kno what i mean :P) Most important thing is.. if he is exasperated, talk about some superb achievements of Australian cricket team.. n then hopefully he will cool down.. :P :P ;)
He is a die-hard fan of Roadies, splits-villa, Bigg-boss, BBT n what not!! one of his best timepass is playing FIFA (definitly after sleeping :P).. all those FIFA moments of him with Laxman had been sheer entertainment.

It was this guy who made me realise that marks are not everything.. passion is what is required.. and yes, this guy is full of passion and enthusiasm!! Well, i need not mention his dedication towards “Australianism!”, coz if i misplace some words.. i wud be dead by tomrw morning.. :P (jus kidding!! ;)). Though he was denied of success many times, but he never gave up the hard work!!
He is the only reason i wanna thnx physics... for keeping us bonded for 1 complete year :D :D I can never imagine my BITS life without u!!

It has always been a wonderful time having u around, all those lonely walks n talks,... the time which i will never forget.. the time which will always remain by my heart.. all those moments of checking out a girl.. :P and later on having some debate about it.. ;) will always remain as memories!! The way u build up the background before delivering ur mind-blowing PJs will never be forgotten :P. All the best for ur very bright future.. n u better keep in touch.. else whenever i will find u.. i will kick ur *** before a warm hug.. will miss u bro!! Cheers to all our blasting times together!! \m/ gud luck :)

PS: abhi to ek saal aur hai... full-on maze karenge ;) :D

<p>They say cricket is a religion. Well if there is anything holier than religion, then that is what cricket means to Akshay. He is a die hard fan of Australia and this i find, is a compliment to the Aussies. He symbolizes sportsmanship. Well, I have seen him throw away his bat a few times when he gets out, but that is just the urge from inside that makes him angry at himself the same urge that drives him to perform better each time. He is wise in victory and even wiser in defeat. He is a very mature, responsible person. Any plans that he has made for the group have always been well organized. He values friendship. He will take into consideration the advice of everyone patiently. What an amazing leader !! It is for this and the many virtues that he caries that he is loved and respected by the entire AH5.
Something else that he likes very much is " Saste Jokes " :P (We all do :P).
He has been a great friend to me, caring and supportive. I treasure his friendship. I would trust him with my life.
I see an illustrious career awaiting you mate. Cheers!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vardhan-thakar">Vardhan Thakar</a></p>
<p>One of the very good friends of mine int his campus and a fellow cricket addict rather than a fan Initially i was surprised to find him such an avid australian cricket fan but then i started to love the way he was, yes just simply who he was. He is an marvellous indivudual who does hardly care for what people think about him and does stuff the way he loves to. One really good thing about him is that he never gets angry on anyone in many situations when he could easily have, this is one thing i really like in him. 
Next part are his jokes when he just pwns the opposite individual completely with his wit and humour. Such is his talent. Coming to acads, ofcourse he is a fellow Eni branch guy , but before that he has endured physics so ic an say he is very much ready for our eni branch challenge up ahead.

Anyways before i write a long story on him, heres wishing a fellow cricket addict, an excellent sportsman , a good friend , a great individual, an excellent personality   all the very best for his future. Its been fun with you all along!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>
