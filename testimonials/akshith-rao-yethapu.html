<h1 class="page-title">Akshith Rao Yethapu</h1><p>Treasurer of BITS Pilani K.K. Birla Goa Campus(2011-2012). Heavy words those, ain't they? !!
Well, if you ask me quite frankly, I don't think there is more responsibility on a single student in the entire campus than the treasurer. Having said that, Akshith stood upto it and accepted every challenge and came out triumphant(well not every time, :P I guess only he and I know when he didn't :P). A uniquely humble, down-to-earth guy who never for once let fame and position go to his head, he is a role-model for all future treasures to come. A bright student, he never let his academics suffer despite the strenuous time constraints while serving as a CSA member. A very caring, soft-spoken person who really knows how to honour friendship. It was a real joy working alongside him for DOFAM for he always gave me enough freedom and space to do my work my way and was supportive at all times, something I admire about him. His charisma and humble attitude make him an instant crowd favourite and his recent "cool-dude" persona won him the "CSA member of the year" award too!! He is no-doubt one of the best persons I have come across on campus who never fails to appreciate people and their work at all times. It was a pleasure knowing you, Akshith and may you achieve all that you desire in life. Hope we remain in touch forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>For three years now, Akshith Rao and I have been together in almost all the labs--MT 1&2, TP 2, Prod Tech....sadly, he's not with me in PFM. Akshith in very simple, level-headed, and above all, he is the most competent guy I have seen. What sets him apart from other people is his extraordinary confidence-- he is always the guy in-charge of any situation, always in control!! You go to him with a problem, the reply is a simple "yeah, I'll see to it".And he does that! No unnecessary beating about the bush. In prod tech lab, after seeing Hyderabadi Nawabs, I used to chat with Akshith in Hyderabadi hindi :-D . All the best Akshith! Stay in touch. May you always be the 'guy in control'.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>

<p>Money+Power+Style=Akshith Rao :) He is one awesome guy who was not just another trez of another CSA, he was THE TREZ, an that too a great one! I am definitely going to miss labs, classes (which we both don't attend these days :P) and few coco moments that were classic & unforgettable moments for the both of us. There is no way I'm missing any more exams in BITS because I can count on him to call me and wake me up :P I mean people just don't care if u are sleeping b4 exams but not this guy, he told me that nowadays there are three things on his checklist b4 exams 1) pen 2) calci 3) call Arvind :) Thanks for that, it reinstates in me the feeling that people are good and will care for you :)  We had the same mobile for a while :P and I am glad I met some1 as humble as Akshith. Managing work and acads is something ppl should learn from him :) Enjoy life like you always do and keep rocking :) Dude u will no doubt have a great future :) Keep smiling<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Akshith- ya he is some tall guy in Ah3 and is in DoFAM that was my impression of him till we met , him as the treasurer and myself as the VP. And third year has been a great journey and one of the best co-passengers in the journey is surely Yethapu Akshith Rao. On first interaction with this true hyderabadi you can feel his confidence, and calmness. Till today have never seen him panic and handles pressure well. This Nokia fan is a gadget freak and will always be hooked on to endgadget or Cnet to what new is coming up ( He must have watched the Nokia 41 mp video atleast 10 times). He very deservedly won the CSA dude of the year because his work involves few of the truly sadist people on Campus! Thanks Akshith for being a good friend and a better human being!! May all your dreams come true!!

<p>Tall,talented,cool and calm.i hope thats enough description for our beloved treasurer, Akshith Rao :).In the beginning,i thought he was more of a hyderabadi dude type, and of-course,its true anyways :P. A good friend, likes to tease(in friendly manner of-course :D). I like your jovial nature,hope you will keep it up :). And this is our last sem together, hope we'll keep in touch :).

<p>A lean tall chap who works a lot in DOFAM, who is down to earth and seems dudism - first impression of Akshith. Had a good time working with you, though I irritated for the most of the time and make Waves achieve great heights. The work of a trez is damn boring and one of the most important work in the CSA, to make it count and to work so dedicatedly, needs some sheer talent. Thanks man for helping out in the work .

Hope you achieve the goals set in your life and be a big Investment Banker one day. 

PS. Your personality is charming and does radiate some positive energy. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Akshith..the dude of our gang :D . He is the most optimistic person and influential guy I have ever seen..He analyses every situation and acts accordingly...he is always smiling, cool, calm going and he has so many nice qualities. He is such a nice guy that you can ask him help at any hour..I have learnt a lot of things from him. Personally he is one of my best friends and we had lots and loads of fun I can never forget. Night canteens, bike rides, movies, football..what notâ€¦I enjoyed every moment I have spent with him. I will miss you a lot after 4-1..I wish you reach all your goals and all the best :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/santosh-ayyagari">Santosh Ayyagari</a></p>
<p>Akshith! Well, I met him for the first time before elections, and I figured he was a cool guy! But then THIS COOL! I mean, with all those budget constraints, I-dunno-how-many-signs to get every freakin deal done, every cheque, fd, dd, gd wat all I dunno cleared, all those conveners, dept coordis to handle, and still be able to always keep smiling, always being there with renewed energy, and yet being able to lead a life without going mad, it takes a lot of brains, passion and calmness to do it! The way you managed it all, was really something I used to look up to for inspiration! Commanding when u have to be, and very good at explanations and rationalisms, I actually became a fan when u had explained me the importance of having more meetings in the coco. I was very stubborn, but the way u said it, put it into my head, was ekdum jhakass! And thatâ€™s what defines u! u are awesome with people! And yea, we just became frnds quite naturally, no effort, but its just that being around with u feels nice! U exude a lot of positive energy ! So yea, always be in touch, and I look forward to a long friendship with you, and much more and better times together! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>

<p>Akshith!! One guy who handles work pressures quite comfortably, like they were child's play!
His cool-headedness and pragmatism are the elements that define him set him apart from the rest of them. Of course, this has won him accolades in quite many places! We've been friends since 1st year and slowly we started getting to know each other better. But it was only in third year that I pestered him the most!! Thanks to you, Celestia now has it's own telescope and now we can promise everyone a lot more than before!! One thing I learnt from him is the fact that success or failure depends on how well you manage things and if it is intrinsic (like it is in him), there's no stopping you in whatever you do!
Way to go man!
All the best! Be the cool guy you've always been! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
