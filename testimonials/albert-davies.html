<h1 class="page-title">Albert Davies</h1><p>Bot, as we all call him, is the 'Technical' Guy from our group... (As you shall have found out by now,it's a rare breed in our campus :D ) Married to Wikipedia and Google, this guy likes spending his spare time on his HP Dv6; and now on his Sony Ericsson tablet :P But yea, this guy sure knows how to get things done (Putty \m/ :D) All his troubleshooting and remote assistance surely made life lot easier for an 'Accountant' like me :D A true scientist by heart, Logic comes naturally to him; and he believes in reasoning out every damn thing! Although experiencing and feeling emotions (big deal for Bot, and his logical mind), his blank expressions sometimes keep giving an error :D He's that kinda guy who will analyze the entire movie upside down before watching just to know if the movie's worth watching and worth the time!! That's Albert! :D (I sometimes tend to both disagree and wonder with the extent of his use of our left brains!) It's been 3 years knowing him now. All this time, it was great to have his company around. From endless discussions trying to outwit his reasonings, walking all those 14 km along the rails, hoping over the railway engine of that cargo train while still freezing in those rains, driving the bike 'together' for 500 km with my hand fractured, taking that 'Leap of Faith' when we went outta petrol, doing that Jugaad at Madgaon at 1.30 am... DUDE! We been through lot of shit together! :D Looking back, from those initial days of poker night-outs, we have come a long way now... It's been a great journey so far. And I hope we will have many more stories to tell, and many new places to explore!! To all those good times! Cheers!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurabh-nayak">Saurabh Nayak</a></p>
<p>Berta. Well its been a very different relationship with him. First came across him as a somnolent, almost nonchalant lil Christian with his bag swung around his back in our early days with monosyllable answers to all my overtures. Then steps in the Robot (filmy style). Easily one of the most logical persons I've ever met, Albert is someone who will make you split your hair apart in a conversation. However I have to say I've enjoyed all the conversations I've had with him. Armed with iron wit and emotions that operate in binary, his penchant for doing something different often brings a smile to my face. I hope you carry this attitude to lands far far away. Kabhi kabhi itna dimaag laga, dil se soch liya kar.  Cheers and god bless for the future. (PS: Hope you get a blonde wife)!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
