<h1 class="page-title">Alok Sharma</h1><p>A person with great moral values and strong likes & dislikes. Chocolates, dogs and Android are the three things he loves the most. Has loads of wit and humor. If you are doing something wrong he will surely correct you and help you in all ways he can and that is the best thing about him which makes him a truly awesome friend :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Alok is one of my first "delhi" friends on campus :) A really simple guy who is always fun to hang out with. He has a great sense of humor and is really organized ( at least when it comes to his laptop :P ). There have been many instances when I have been jealous of his street smartness in a lot of matters ranging from general knowledge to geeky stuff regarding gadgets and computers. Although he stays in a different corridor, he has spend many happy hours with us which were super fun :D. Cheers to all the jokes we laughed at and all the random things we did in AH3! Best of luck for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>

A multi talented guy  who is good in academics as well as in gaming.One thing that i have learned about him is that U can't argue with him unless you are pandu(paritosh). It was real  fun hanging out with him.As simple friend as he is, he is very helpful to others.It was a gr8 time to be in same branch and all the cool stuff we did together.May you have a gr8 life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>Alok Pro Sharma. The Android Guy. Zune Lover. Modest. Isko woh Cute wali Bandi pasand hai. Discussion of Incomplete Assignments, and asking - Oye, Syllabus complete hua ? The Uncountable Number of Night Outs for completing the same, someone who always tries to be funny but somehow just fails [:P] and a die hard fan of the Movie - Gandu, Alok is one of the few IS Buddies that I have.  I'm sure Alok aage kabhi kisi TV Show pe Tech Reviews de rha hoga. Wishing him the very best in life. GM Ab. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>

<p>Alok Sharma... My neighbour for past 3 years and I couldn't have asked for a more adjusting one... I cannot even remember the number of times i have woken u up at 3 - 4ish in the morning considering how big a freak i am of watching muvz on speakers... U have been to say the least a silent geek right beside me... I remember the time wen u customized ur browser with some coding shit nd u told me u had done it all by urself... That was insane man!! And the Guitaring that we have had.. Not very often but it has been sweet... Discussions on "Life".. the two or three that we have had during these 3 years, have been to say the least nothing but refreshing... It has always been good having you around man... Have a blast in ur future... I guess by this time u would have realized that in the long run, CG doesnt matter afterall... I know i have... ;) Cheers Alok..
P.S. - Thank you for making me look cool in front of every1 in my sophomore year who saw my desktop - with reference to Rainmeter!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mudit-sinha">Mudit Sinha</a></p>
