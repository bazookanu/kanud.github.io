<p>In one word : wise

In a sentence or less : he is the godfather

Alok Upadhyay is the knowledge center for my group. He is highly well-informed. Perhaps, he knows everything. He can tell just by the sound of an incoming flight the make of the plane. He is the wise guy, with answers to all our queries whether academic or not. He is an avid programmer, and loves to code.

<p>hi alok.

the way u wud finish the lab-dude,i was always surprised. _/\_
in meantime,though we missed some labs where we were not sidees/partners, it was always my pleasure in having a friend like u.
u were so great that u wud allow me to peep at ur screen in EG labs :D :P

anyways, wishing u all d best and great success for ur future & career ahead,

<p>An excellent, charismatic personality, Alok carries a characteristic aura of positiveness and mystique around himself. The deep voice and sharp face speak volumes about his immense sense of dignity, integrity and responsibility, while the perfect charming smile never goes unnoticed. With an impeccable attitude and flawless self-bearing, Alok's character is a beckoning one and no wonder he has a lot of fiends, of whom I am honoured to be one. He is a person who has mastered the art of carrying himself in a very dignified and calm manner, reflecting his persona and his military upbringing. You have been a great friend and a very helpful one. I still remember the day when the IL-76 Pic on my cupboard sparked a conversation between us and since then, it has been a wonderful journey. Thanks for being a part of my life in this campus and I shall cherish the times I spent with you. Wish you all luck in life and a very happy and successful career ahead. Farewell! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>I don't know what to say about this amazingly knowledgeable personality. The first impression of him was a centre of knowledge varying from biology to aeronautics. And believe me, it's still the same. Frankly speaking he's a very homely kind of guy which every parent would want to have. Every decision of his is taken prioritizing his family first. He is a person who would do a post-Morten of the job he's doing and excel in it. For instance, when studying from a textbook, he'd dig into the biography of the author and know he's studying what and from whom. I can NEVER even dream about doing such things. He's a guy who probably gets aroused by the sound of an airplane. I remember when he'd just name the plane by the sound of it. (Holy Shit !). In short, a true genius. You'd be successful wherever you go my friend. Take my word. Have a wonderful life ahead. Cheers !

<p>Alok aka apna DADDU!!....He is the best room neighbor  i could have ever had in BITS. He never complained even if i played loud music or as everyone would agree spoke loudly. (Uppal, who lives 4 rooms away would  get miffed ,but Alok-he never complained!! not even once!!). Aisa hi hai humara daddu!! A word that could easily explain Alok in word is-"gentleman". The best quality about him is that he is very passionate about his work. He has in-depth knowledge about politics, aircrafts and computers. And the quality that i like the most about him is that you can always get something to eat at his room. :P......I am very sure that with his  diligence and genius he will definitely achieve whatever he wants in life. 
PS:- daddu means papa of papas ….so jo log apne aap ko papa bula rahe hai …Daddu hi asli papa ….!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-bharadwaj">Aditya Bharadwaj</a></p>
<p>Alok Sirji... I know him since my PS. Our friendship has grown since then over random bike-riding talks and PS1 days. A very good friend, excellent team leader and intelligent as hell. You need no luck in life buddy, you will succeed. Keep in touch. :)
P.S. : (i got to ask this) How do you feel among engineers ??? <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>Buddha hai sala......khud ko baap bolta hai par aaj tak kabhi baap hone ka farz nahi nibhaya......ulta bacho se paise leke kha jata hai!! Fun loving person, very dedicated to his work.....whenever you go to his room, which is the common room of that corridor, you will find him doing something on his laptop, i can't assure that he really does all that or just to impress people coming to his room :P. He has extraordinary knowledge about planes. He can tell which plane it is just by looking at the flying plane _/\_. Very short tempered, so its better to maintain distance from him, for people like me....or you can end up in the hospital! He particularly hates some people, and countries and by mistake if you say something good about the country or people he hates, you will not be pleased to hear is response :P Buddhe all those nights spent in ur room, talking, doing masti etc etc are unforgettable. Those are the memories worth telling your own children. Will miss u man!! Always be in touch. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>

May ur dedication n interests take you places! all d best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>Alok, also known as daddu aur hamare pyaare dadaji.... :)
He is the head of our BITS family(i consider he is...maybe others dont ;)). He is a guy who follows the principles he has made for himself. He is a guy who wants to be busy with work all the time, atleast pretend to be busy(like me :P). His modus operandi is similar to mine in many ways. Doesn't like to go out much. Is fond of parathas and other oil dipped, sugar coated food items!! He is a big moody.. goes on periods :D many a times. Thinks too much and is very shy. He can simply bear your nuisance but will not utter a word even when he wants you to shut up. Alok, be open man... show them, tell people what you want... 
I admire him a lot in professional life. I guess he was near to zero in programming when he joined this institute. But, the programming skills he has developed in these 3 years are simply remarkable._/\_ He knows almost a dozen languages now and is a real pro IT guy. Although he is pursuing a diploma here :P :D i am pretty sure he knows more than those CS engineers.. 
He is a great friend to have and is really a caring person. All the best for your future... I know you will do wonders. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-agha">AKSHAT AGHA</a></p>
<p>Gatar hai saala!! Kuch bhi toh kha leta hai!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Alok urf Budhha a.k.a. daddu, to say the least, has been an inspiration for me. One of my most dear friends, he is one of the most knowledgeable, understanding and sincere guys I have ever met. And the reason behind calling him ‘Budhhe ’ has been pretty much the same, the amount of knowledge, and moreover, the wisdom he has, would make him sound like some old person with immense knowledge, who could suggest you a solution with almost any problem you have. He is a person full of dignity and self-respect, and has set high aims for his life. But setting goals is not the end of it, he really works hard to achieve something he is passionate about. But if something doesn’t appeal him, it’s really hard to convince him to even give a thought to it. He is a very gentle person, full of manners, keeps a cool head at times of distress, and in short, a person you look up to when you are facing some difficulty. So yeah, you better find him if a problem finds you. :P And probably that’s what I have been doing all these 3 years I have spent with him. Whether it’s IS CDCs, COP, SE group project, all those hilarious presentations or vellapanthi in corri, he has been my ‘partner in crime’. All in all, Alok is a perfect friend you would want. Although, all of his qualities can’t surpass his single, most impactful attribute, which is his patience. He doesn’t complain even if he is the most bugged with you or the conversation he is having. He would take time out and listen to you patiently, even if he has some urgent work to do. But probably that’s the only thing which (only at times) makes him jittery. But he is still abstinent enough not to display it publicly. “Choosing not to act on an angry impulse and to feel the pain that lies beneath, it is a very courageous thing to do.” This quote is made for you man. :) You really are a great human being. You would definitely excel and do a great job in life. All the Best.
P.S Maybe this being the last sem with you made me write all this. Otherwise it’s all made up and fictitious :P ;)
