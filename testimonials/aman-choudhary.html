<h1 class="page-title">Aman Choudhary</h1><p>He was my MT-2 lab partner & that was the first time I met him. He has great sense of humor. He was also my lab partner for DECO & Ananlog. It was fun to work with him. He is smart & intelligent. Best guy to be with if u want to do some last moment jugaad. Har lab mein 10 mins pehle report shuru karna aur full marks laana "chaman" se seekho. Lab sessions would have been boring without your presence.  I wish you all the best for your future en devours.. Be in touch..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Mera saamne waali .... mein ek .... ka ..... rehta hai :P Aman Aman Aman, words aren't enough to write about this cool dude who can scare the shit out of you with his monstrous eating habits :P He can sniff the presence of biscuits in my room from a mile away and will go on a hunting spree till he finds the hidden treasure :P <exaggeration....not really!> But all in all a good football player, an awesome EEE pro & a \m/ neighbor when he is not playing AOE/DoTA or CS at loud volumes :) I wish him all the best for the future which in his own words "OB acha hoga yaar!". I am gonna miss those "aaaaahaaan Arvind lines :P" But all the best and keep rocking :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Chaman !! A fully foodie,fun-loving person,who never lets you down.Has awesome time spent with him,whether its usual common room football matches,or the occasional night canteen,bogmalo trips, or the random Poker games,I have loved every second of him.How to forget your legendary B-day celebration last summers,I really had a nice time getting back home in a completely unknown city half drunk :P. .He is super intelligent,despite his unending Football matches,CS/AOE nightouts ,he nails his studies,given this high performance trait,he is bound to succeed well.. Wish him a happy future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>Wololo ! The only EEE guy I know who has a soft spot for "The Maan". Fellow Old Monk lover, foodie, Pappu Fan, Angrez lover, we practically live in Srini's room as exams draw close. Mostly we end up watching stupid videos on loop. Tig Ol' Bitties, Like A Boss, Baba Lagin to name a few. Preys upon Guru and Srini. Amazing footballer, Aces acads and real pro at AoE and CS. Velino trips are incomplete without Chaman. So Cheers and always remember "What happens in Little Chef stays in Little Chef " . -Fungii

<p>Chamaaaaan!! I met chaman for the first time during SLAM in the first year and it's fair to say, he made sure i'd remember him. It was only in the second year,when we were part of the football team,did i actually get to know him and i'm oh so glad i did! A fellow foodie, Manchester United supporter and Suga babes star! I'll never forget the insane times we've had, be it in goa, in Manipal or even that EPIC Bangalore trip we took(I JUST WANNA LIVE! :P). This man is an absolute TANKER so never challenge him to a drinking competition, NEVER. Chaman has been an awesome, awesome friend these last few years and i'm really going to miss this fatass! Take care Chams! 
ONE TEAM! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>

<p>Buddhu Boss! A fellow EEE victim and BITSFC member, I really got to know this guy well in the 3rd year. The velino trips, sathe/varad/viggy bashings, mane imitations, aoe marathons - unforgettable. A top notch defender, this guy is a scholar too. This is one guy who manages to ace exams without touching his books. EEE comes naturally to him, like a bee takes to a flower, and he has blossomed under the tender care of mane and ADVD. May you live long and prosper and wed shabbar and have beautiful kids. And PS2 will be epic. Wololo.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Never the kind of guy to be humble about compliments, Chaman is a raging bull on the football field and loves beef chilli fry. Fellow Dead, S&G and Billy Joel fan, when Chaman is at a party, there is never enough food or enough booze. Smart as a smart-ass, together we were unfortunate witness to one of Bob's barrages of pathetic supposed-to-be-jokes one fine night during compres. "Mast, mast rehta hai, ekdum takatak rehta hai." Read that at 15x and you have a pretty good Chaman imitation for yourself. NOT. He's got style man.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Things you need to know about Chaman:

1. He has the sexiest thighs ever. (Ask Bappi, he'll tell you). Thighs that have been nurtured by hours spent on the football field, striking fear into the hearts of opponents as he rages down the pitch.

2. The man can eat and drink anything, any amount. Give him a pitcher of beer and a plate full of beef chilli fry, and watch it disappear.

3. Phodu banda hai yaar. The guy aces EEE courses, and never seems to study for more than a day.

4. Chaman pwns AoE, CS and most important of all, Donkey.

5. He holds a soft spot for the terror that is Mane, evident by his soon-to-be-released single, 'Assignment'.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
<p>One awesome fun guy he is. One of the best footballers of campus he is, though I never got football myself, sorry chaman. And one great brain. Has phodufied most of his cdcs, even though he doesn't seem to be studying most of the time. Has been a really awesome neighbour, from attacking my room for food(glutton) to advancing in aoe from a complete noob to one of the best. Not to forget his snipes and knifes in CS :| Hope we continue playing via hamachi or voobly. And best of luck for your future endeavours. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mayank-singh">Mayank Singh</a></p>
<p>Aman the Chaman. Didn't know him well in first 2 years. But started knowing him because of AOE. We started and played a lot of AOE. He has become a pro in it so I left the game as I started feeling inferiority complex. I can't forget the game when Marcus's largest army was 18. A well planned assassination. He loves food in any format. Has the capacity and potential to remember really huge and scary formulas. Itna phodta hai ki ab kehna padega "Li8 le" in a tone when he says "Khel le".<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Chaman, one of the most intelligent and witty people I know.  A natural sportsperson, he is brilliant at football and  T.T. Also an AoE and CS pro(mostly from what I have heard). He is a very knowledgeable guy and it is always fun discussing any topic with him. It is said that when Chaman is around, there can be no leftovers :P. A foodie to the core, I thank him for introducing me to Nev's. I hope to go to all those places in Thane that you've mentioned countless times and also have Biryani at your home. Drinks like a tanker and he is one guy who can take your case so badly after downing a few spirits, that you might be reduced to tears. Quite literally.
I know for sure that he will make it big in the future. Future tera ekdum mast rahega. Takatak ekdum.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>I believe the term ‘raging bull’ was coined with Aman Choudhary in mind. Aman. The man with the sexiest thighs – certified by Bappi himself. One of my EEE-Velino’s brethren and fellow Old Monk connoisseur. Aman. Every dyslexic person’s nightmare – given the speed at which he speaks. I cannot fathom why we started hanging out only in 2nd year – but I don’t think neither of us remember much about that period anyways :P The bastard has made me out to be a complete drunkard – nothing can be more ironical, given his capacity for food and drink. Aman has introduced and initiated me to some of the most epic things ever – Tig Ol’ Bitties, Baba Lagin, Nev’s, Preeti’s, Pappu Fan Club, Like A Boss, Show them to me and what not. Also, my Micro & DECO teacher and one of the few who managed to ace our CDCs – EEE subjects come naturally to him. If I ever do end up starting a company, as he keeps saying, there’s no one other than Aman who’ll be in charge of circuit design and simulations. Also a prodigious football player, together, him and Abin are like an unsurmountable wall. Virtually lives out of Srini’s room and mooches off everyone he knows when he can help it. Never one to turn down an opportunity to party, Aman’s one person I’ve had the most epic parties and night-outs with. I can never forget that epic Bangalore trip we had together – Pico’s, the youth hostel, Abin’s antics, Jinx on bluff… We’ve come a long way from being just Velino company to the best of friends. He’s one of the most dependable friends I’ve had and also one who never misses an opportunity to take my case. I’ll miss not being party to the epic PS2 that is gonna happen in Bangalore, but 4-2 is in the offing bitch! Tab tak, mast ekdum takatak rehne ka chaman… aate hi, khundal khundal ke party karna hai! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Also, here's a toast to our friendship... this is gonna be one that endures the test of time! Unless you start crooning "I just wanna live"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Chaman are I are Unbeatable together!With him in the defense and me attacking there is no stopping our team. We've won so much together, Manipal, Slam11, Slam12, BPL10 and Goa league. Was great to have him in team. Every time i had a dry spell he would come and motivate me. I have always been jealous of his heading! Off the pitch he's an incredible friend, witty and intelligent. He hogs like a buffalo and that's why he's also known as 'Bhaise' and his capacity for alcohol is also huge. Feels good to know we'll play next spree together.Will miss you man.Keep in touch!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Chaman a.ka. srini-chod is one of those who will take anybody's case in any situation, mostly me and srini and undoubtedly he is great company. Though irritating at times, he has always been helpful and even though we dont hang out much often, when we do the times are epic ( the activa shit at the petrol pump :P). It was in this corridor that the legend of Tea was born and Tata Tea got publicity ( what say :P). The tenacity in the face when he gets to see food and beer cant be described in words. He is brilliant in acads and AOE as well. Claims to be a better FIFA player than me, but we ll figure that out in 4-2. The Angrez time along with our passion for skating :P, man i m gonna miss all that. But i hope we make for the lost drinking time by having more Angrez days in 4-2 varna tujhe kundal-kundal ke maarunga. Thinks srini is a "chaand ka tukda" for god knows what ( value added services :P). We share similar passion for football, the only difference is that he plays the sport as well and is pretty good at it as well. Hope ur fridge never falls short of beer!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>Popularly known as Chaman,Aman is one of my closest friends on campus.He's a multi-talented, level headed guy who is more than willing to help at any possible time. Without his presence, any outing can get boring especially if its Bogmalo. He is also an amazing footballer, whose thighs are admired by my neighbour. He is the reason I'm no longer a teatotaler.Inspite of bunking all lectures and studying towards the end, he manages to ace acads, a truly remarkable quality.Also, Chaman has an appetite like no other man and its awesome fun watching him ask Guru for food, and Guru refusing. There was once a time when I could defeat him and Bhatta together in AOE but now the tables have reversed.It has been an incredible 3 years with you and looking forward to the next 6 months  in Bangalore. (unless you go to Noida :P)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
