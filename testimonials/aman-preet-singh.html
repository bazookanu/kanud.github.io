<p>Paaji, aka god-like banda, my bestest buddy ever!!! if i start listing down his qualities, it would take nearly two light years to complete jotting them down... still enlisting a few, Aman, Mere bachpan ka dost, mera yaar, Aman is gifted with an exceptional mind... The humblest and the most caring person ive ever met, no matter what and how much he achieves, his feet are still on the ground.. :).. He has a huuugee heart, be it friends, relatives , unknown people or even mess workers.. :P the one who comes for help.. get it!! .. whenever i feel down, or over excited about something,and in need of a friendly support, Aman is the first name which pops into my head.
While coming to this campus, a new place with unknown people, the only assurance and relief which boosted me in this exceptional journey was your company at all times... 
You mesmerized each and everyone associated with you here with your load full of qualities.. whenever i would trip over a hurdle ,or got disillusioned, I knew, ki koi ho na ho, paaji would be there, lending me his helping hand... cheers to the awesomm moments we spent together, and cheers for the awesom time still left to be spent, just one line for you dude-
"True friends are like diamonds, precious and rare,,
False friends are like autumn leaves , lying everywhere.."
to my truest friend of alll.. paaji rokks!!! \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>

<p>Consider yourself to be the audience of a contest in which Aman is participating, and you have to guess who will be the winner of it... your answer definitely won't be this guy!!! Your first thought, "He won't be able to win it!!!" But then after the event gets over, and the results are announced, the following symptoms will occur to you. Your eyes gets wide open, and so does your mouth. A lightening bolt strikes you, the earth below you moves (not literally), heartbeat gets faster, and then a thought comes to your mind.."How did this guy ....?!!" Yes, this is the level of my friend, known as Aman Preet Singh. You will not only be surprised by the result, but by the way he achieves it. He simply does not cease to awe you with his performance. That does not only apply to academics (mostly it does), but to all other things that he does too. An extremely calm minded, caring, talented, genius, patient listener, a good manager, always looking forward and a great teacher. Every single word holds for him, as good as any law. A very balanced and organized person, that you will be proud to be a friend of. Definitely cannot be called a nerd (infact most of the time you will find him sleeping), but still is the most proficient student of computer science. One does not simply get the "Godlike Banda" award for nothing. Always ready to help you, and guide you in your hard times. He is the godfather of our hostel, has his unique style of working and definitely gets whatever he wants. Will never boast, or showoff, is very down to earth person, always does every work with full concentration, and gives his best. Has topped the most number of courses in the cs branch (easily), and continues to do so in this sem too. He is the "Singh" who is not only the "King" but the "Emperor" of our campus. You rule my friend, and may God always be with you. I know you will supersede any person in the field in which you step, so go ahead and become a remarkable personality in this world. God bless you..and be in touch!! :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyesh-shrivastava">Priyesh Shrivastava</a></p>
<p>Aman is one of the few people who reached out to me from the very start. I faintly recall meeting him at a staircase, where he warmly introduced himself. I quickly came to know of him as a man of excellence in execution; one who seemed to shine at everything he did. That is, by and large, the reputation he holds, so I'll skip the part where I tell you about how he has stood out at so many levels. You already know that! I have come into close association with him, by way of multiple group activities; and I must tell you about how much of a leader he is. He is always at the heart of everything, and when he deals with a problem, he pulls not just himself, but everyone of his group mates through it. Having him on your side makes things so much easier, that one would find himself addicted to being with him. And mind you, that addiction is widespread. Another of the conspicuous traits he bears, is his charisma - the gift of a magnetic personality. That, along with his clarity of expression, has made him a steerer of public emotion, and often, the voice of the body of students. I could hardly convey how obvious it is, that he is going to be successful: he can't not be! I will only add my prayer, that he finds his destined success in a field that is to his liking. Best of luck to you, Aman. You have taught me a lot, and I shall bear it all my life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tuhin-sah">Tuhin Sah</a></p>
<p>When I think of my hostel, the first image that comes to my mind is that of Aman. He is a talented and well balanced person who is very helpful. A bright student.... he would extend his help to everyone and often before exams, I would be among one of his many clueless mates who would be sitting in his room to seek his invaluable guidance which would help me get a fraction of his score which I completely owe to him. He is not a typical nerd who studies all the time but does watch a lot of movies and goes out to play cricket. A very modest guy who never boasts about his achievements. Its my privilege to be his friend and I respect him for all that he is. 
Good character, brains and talent all put in one package, this guy is "truly Godlike". May god bless you<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Aman Preet Singh aka Paaajiiiiiiii ………… I don’t remember how exactly I met you. But had heard a lot from others about your <strong>proness</strong> :) And then I experienced it myself. Paaji is very hardworking, dedicated and passionate to his work. Be it anything - acads, hostel activities or organizing festivals. His humble nature and positive attitude are an example for others. Everybody knows how helpful he is. Anytime of the sem, he is ready to help you out. He explains you the concepts so beautifully and makes them feel so simple that you wonder why I didn’t get it earlier. One of the very few in campus who actually want to learn things rather than just study them for marks. Wherever you go Paaji, you are sure to spread positivity with your charisma. I feel privileged to have you as my friend Paaji. Wish you all the best for future and do keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Paaji the God. Pseudo professor of CS. The one who deserves to take the place of all those cunts who cant teach in CS Dept. Phodu banda who always helps others. Respect. Best of luck for your future and keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>

<p>There are some qualities which just cannot go hand in hand. For instance, Pure brilliance and modesty; for instance pure courage,valor and being so soft spoken and calm all the time. I saw this antithesis in real life as Aman Preet Singh. Pure brilliance he is. But the utter modesty amazes me till date. Calm and composed at all times. And man!! That radiant, iridescent smile.. Love it. I have seen him work & play, have seen him participating in all types of events and what not with an undying passion. The most important thing is that he is simply in love with whatever he does and whatever he pulls of, he does that with perfection. Aman Preet Singh :salute: You have been an inspiration.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Paaji- a banda who doesn't need a confirmation from the nareal committee to be called godlike. A phodu in the true sense, (getting his marks based on brilliance rather than just studying for exams), as was apparent from his topping the ultra competitive Nettech workshop. Awesomely friendly and humble despite all this, he is one of those few  guys you always talk to even without too much connection/ introduction . Very approachable and always smiling. Wishing you good luck for life- aise hi phodte rehna!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-palnitkar">Aditya Palnitkar</a></p>
<p>I think of Aman and the first thing that pops into the mind is : his warm-heartedness! What an amazing person! A loving friend, in the best possible ways. Aman is that wonderful friend who will cheer you up when others cannot. He is talkative, in a good way, almost always smiling, and i must add, highly intelligent. When he speaks, people listen. When he listens, people feel awesome. Aman has the natural qualities of a leader and yet is so humble and polite. For starters, the guy is big. but his heart is even bigger. Aman, don't judge me for writing this so late. you may be the last, but you are definitely not the least. You have just so many qualities that i admire and want to learn. I never could become one of your closest friends but i have always wanted to, and know this that you will not be forgotten anytime soon. Since we have different PS slots, let me say Goodbye now in writing. You are a wonderful person and it is a fact that you will be tremendously successful in life in whatever you choose to do. god bless you. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
