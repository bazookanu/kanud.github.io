<h1 class="page-title">Ameya Karambelkar</h1><p>Ameya is one of the most cool headed and laid back persons i have known. He has a tendency of leaving everything to the last moment, but nevertheless in the last semester he proved it all. This friend of mine from the +2 days was always going to be one those friends whom you call anytime, but it is just that he doesn't pick up his phone. You'll be lucky if he picks it up in the first try. But Ameya is one of the friends whose memories you'll cherish for life!! Kudos to you Ameya!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>Known by many names like Sasa, Amba, Ramya, Ameya is a person who will always be there for you,through thick and thin.You can trust him with your life.
It is great fun to be around him. He is the only one who can successfully counter Aniket. Ameya is an excellent football player and and a football fanatic, so many epic games we have seen together!. He is an indisposable part of Exodus the CS clan(with Sumant,Aniket,Nakul and Prathamesh). I will never forget the football games, the time spent chitchatting in A-mess and the countless trips to mongi. For Ameya, his friends are his life, a true Vinny Chase!! 
I will be a part of your Entourage for life!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>Ameya is a person with whom you can never have a dull moment...ever.I have known him from the time I was born. A really fine personality, total sports fan (football and cricket at the top). He can bring humour to any situation, even if says something seriously-he gives a totally new meaning to 'Humour'. Our chats and talks mostly involve insane,thunderous laughter, be it a lecture or his room. He can actually read my mind in these situations, and then he bursts out laughing (a slap on the back, or a smack on any surface soon follows) without me even saying anything. Classes are never dull when he is next to me or, for that matter, within earshot.One of my frequent partners when i visit Ashram-always ready to have a bit of fun and some timepass.And when it comes to working, he is someone who never shows even the slightest sign of fatigue, even after working for hours on end. He is the true 'Yaaron ka Yaar'-he always puts others ahead of him.He is the guy you ask when you want some useful information.--A good gamer....His areas of expertise are limitless. BRO!! Let the Fireworks begin!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Friends from Junior KG  to BITS... studied together throughout! That's saying something for sure :D
I am not sure when and how we met (come on, we were like 4), but Ameya has been one heck of a friend, right from the start. 
He is one of the most talented and creative people I have ever known and will ever know. Always the school topper, acing all the competitive exams while at the same time balancing football and gaming, man he knows how to manage his time. He is also the one who taught me CS (thanks a ton!). I have never known anyone to hold A long like you do! :D
I won't share any anecdotes here, there are just too many of them. All I want to say is, being your friend has been great. Really great. 
Good Luck mate! (We'll be in touch obviously)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>Ameya is one of the most hardworking persons I have met. A Pro Gamer: AOE, CS to name a few. He is an excellent football, cricket, TT player. (Library keeda since third year!) He is a down to earth person. We had a good time studying together. It was fun to work along with him for Mali's project. He is very friendly and helping. I glad to have a friend like him! I wish you All the Best and may you succeed in whatever you choose to do.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>I have known Ameya for the past 6 years, and I can say one thing about him he will always  be there to help you.After knowing him you may wonder why is he acting so friendly with everyone , ,well thats how Ameya is !. 
If I were you I would not change a single thing about myself  , waise bhi perfection ko improve karna mushkil hota hai .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prathamesh-dilip-gaikwad">Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad</a></p>
<p>Like Karna from Mahabharata,Ameya will do anything for his friends.Excelling in studies as well as sports he truly is a complete person.Has great oratory and language skills.Confidence is one of his strong points.(though irritating during debates :P ). He is one of the come back kings of BPGC.He gels with everyone and always is very helpful.His GK is vast (wikipedia :P). One of the 3 Ashram musketeers ;) and the Baresi of our quartet of giant eaters his love for food is unchallenged.He is a TRUE ManU , Maldini , Sachin , Federer (& Sharapova ;) ) fan.I emphasize on the word TRUE because his love for them can rival that of the Half Blood Prince.Of course you will "always!" be a BIG part of my life. To the brand ambassador of Pune and Misal Pav .... all the best mate :) "tere jaisa yaar kahaan , kahaan aisa yaraana" ......
Agatha Christie \m/ ,Kishore Kumar is Der Kaiser and It is and will always be Pune va Itar :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-satish-kulkarni">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>I had always known ameya to be the topper of his school in acads as well as sports from school days ( we had a common friend) . So when i actually met him on the first day in BITS and it was like we had known each other for many years. We have many things in common including the belief in jinxes, the philosophy of how to achieve success, as well as THE choice of you know what :-) . One thing about Ameya that makes him awsm, is the ability to win dialog battles. He can literally make you forget what the original point was, and he'll make you feel very foolish. Many people still try hard to achieve enough perfection to debate ameya ( pagya for one instance :-) ), but alas!! in vain . Ameya has also been a major trend setter and everyone of us now speaks like him. He has always been a male- friendship fan ( just like me!!!)  and is devoted to "Entourage" and " DCH".  His school and society friends are also our close friends now ( Wakli ,THE ONE , Jaideep and many more).  Ameya - Pagya duals are a constant source of ultimate entertainment :-D . He has always been my study mate and  it was awsm the way we used to study all night the day before exam ( SPM T2 !!!!!). He is also a foody, and has a huge appetite ( especially for saturday lunch rice !!!). He is very confident about literally everything and shows his epic closed eyed face while being so ( pagya feels like killing him when he does this :-D ). But his confidence is rightly justified by the fact that he has actually memorized the entire wikipedia. He is a die-hard shahrukh khan fan and keeps watching his old movies again and again. His computer is fully dusty and desktop full of 100's of icons ( aniket gets very pissed off at this :-) ). He is a very fast sprinter ( used to hit rachit and run :-) ). He is a pakka Punekar ( has loads of maaz = attitude )  and speaks the most pure Marathi (still he got less marks in marathi in 10th :-) ). If not for him all of us would'v never attended early morning lectures. He wakes all of us by knocking our doors in his typical  fashion like some alarm ( it has snooze also, coz he comes again and starts knocking if we dont wake up :-) ).  He has a lot of knowledge and interest in finance ( he was an active member of the wallstreet club) . He doesn't drink, and hence is our guardian when we are in 7th heaven ( and he enjoys it too, he tells us all the crazy stuff that we were doing). He is a nice driver ( sumant will kill me for this :-D ) , though once while he was learning he had given us a very bumpy ride. He is a man of principles and has certain principles that he iterates with his patent closed eyed expression ( the one that infuriates pagya ). Oh! and he can do anything for having jilbis !!!! I have to stop but you might have noticed that within 3 years we'v become the best of friends :-) . I am sure he'll achieve great success in whatever he pursues ( no naat :-) ) . All the best !!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-gote">Paritosh Gote</a></p>
<p>He's my co-founder of the Batman-till-death fanclub on campus. :D Ameya is one of the smartest easy-going people on campus. Its been a good three years sharing our passions for Wall Street stuff, TV Shows, Batman, Sunday breafast and Agatha Christie. Times spent in WSC bitching about other jackasses, creating news items, installing softwares have been so much fun. We'll meet later when you're the corporate honcho of some kickass financial firm =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Ameya , where do I start? For starters, the guy who has it all. Multi-talented, looks, brains, /\ at sports ( both in real and cyber world) , and to top it all, his marriage is fixed :D( for more info contact pagya) . I have spent some very memorable moments with him which I will come to in a while. Let's start with his school life . From what I have heard he has managed to ace all school level exams , the list is too long, while being on the school football team at the same time. His mastery over English is awe-inspiring. He is a through and through Poirot fan(\m/) and had read all Christie books _/\_ well before joining college. He is also an exceptional artist( all mech ppl are ;-) ) . He enjoys the old hindi melodies as much as he enjoys Opeth or Porcupine tree. He is an outright Kishore Kumar fan , and has memorised almost all of his songs , which he unfortunately cannot sing without reducing universe's entropy :D His level of admiration for R.D. Burman can only be matched by his hate for Aatif ( although Gulabi Aakhein by AAtif /\ ). Another person he worships(apart from me) is P.L. Deshpande who is probably the source for Ameya's exceptional command over marathi . His way of expressing marathi proverbs is now used by all in the group ( Gadhvala '-''-' chav '-''-' ) .
Another passion of his is football. Now that Mr. Chelsea will leave campus, ameya will be the most knowledgeable person on campus as far football is concerned. Alas, his predictions about football games are never true. He is a hard-core ManU supporter and can recall almost every football match that has been played after 1990. He also plays football and tennis well apart from CS( Exodus \m/) and AoE, although he lacks certain skills inherently required for CS. (hearing and aiming ability :D ). He has memorised almost the entire of wikipedia and one should tread with caution while betting against his *wiki-like* knowledge( I have always lost against him, apart from the one time he got Saif Ali Khan's age wrong \m/ ). Apart from this , he is a huge food fan just like me( paripuri bet ONN(pagya style) ). Out thought process is almost along the same lines and our matching wavelengths just reinforce the saying 'Great minds think alike' :D . All in all, over the past 3 years ameya has become one of my best friends . I will always remember our dinner at IC ( no man can eat so much ) and his epic expression where he closes his eyes and tilts his face upwards when expressing confidence. He is a through and through Puneri and a great person to be friends with. Have a great life ahead!!!!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>

<p>Ameya !! He has a lot of friends. I mean LOT. Gundas, Mavalis, Rich boys, studious geeks, smart alecs (like me :P). This guy has befriended them all. And why not ? Ameya is the true 'Yaaron ka Yaar'. He puts friends on a top pedestal. I mean you could call Ameya for help on his Suhaag Raat and he will abandon everything and come to help you. I am warning you Ameya about this. Dont do this if something like this happens. Ameyas humour is unparalleled. He is a pakkah Puneri. Thinks he is good at everything. Argues with everyone over movies, actresses, news, sports etc. but never wins. Plays awesome CS and football. He is one of biggest foodies of our groups, (after me :P), and boy the mess conversations we have are amazing. We both love teasing Pagya and Sumant. And this guy is really good and shuttin up your mouth in a trash talk. (But not mine :P). Life has been awesome since 2009 when I first met you. Those laughs, those chats, trash talks, DoSM outings, DoSM drives (GSL OMFG). Cheers !! And keep in touch. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mrinmay-milind-kulkarni">Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>You are as precious to me as you are to your own mother and father. That pretty much sums it all. He has been one of my closest friend (or sidekick :P) through the 3 years of my bits life. When I first met him(a fellow punekar) I thought this would be fun, and indeed it has been. Ameya is one multi-talented guy. Sports, acads,  girls, wallstreet stuff to say a few. His resolution to succeed is more important than any other distraction put in his way. An avid reader,an excellent card player, a true football enthusiast and a good player too. All those times spend discussing various topics like movies, tv series, books, sports and so on always have deep and insightful and most of times we have wasted hours discussing things that don’t concern us. All those gaming sessions have been epic and it was a honour to play with some of same caliber if not more. All the best for your future endeavors and I know you’ll always stay ahead of the curve!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-thakare">Nakul Thakare</a></p>
