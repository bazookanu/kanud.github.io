title: AMIT BHALERAO

<h1 class="page-title">AMIT BHALERAO</h1><p>Amit aka The Phodu. A great dancer, spiritually inclined and a very good friend of mine, he just can’t hurt you. Because to his caring and innocent nature, he is a very lovable person. His way of seeing things in the world is far different from others :-P He is the 'King of Hathodas' ('Hathodas' are kind of like Pjs but you will laugh like anything).He is storehouse of good qualities. Very passionate and dedicated towards his work, HIS ROOM IS SECOND COMMON ROOM FOR US ;-) . He is very creative and knows innumerable softwares of editing, video making and graphics design. He makes everyone laugh around him. He is a great fan of Bollywood (he doesn’t believe in watching movies of DvDRip or much higher quality). As soon as any movie gets released on DC, he just can’t help watching it immediately. (agar kisi ne pahle movie dekh kar uski thodi bhi story bata di toh woh amit ka sabse bada dushman). Chal Hat Chat Hat .. Bhalerao Bhalerao. Due to his creativity and his passion towards life, he will be really successful. I wish him all the best for a bright future ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-sharma">Akash Sharma</a></p>

<p>Bhale is one of the nicest and the most down to earth persons i know. A real harworker, i knew mostly from my 3rd year when we were in the core together.  He is amazing with softwares, he can make even very dismal events like our quark performance seem to be like a much awaited world cup cricket final with the kind of posters he makes. A true bollywood fanatic, he will not take anything against his sharukh khan. This year in the club was a lot of fun with him being around. Guess we also made good on our resolution we took in the starting of 3-1 :P All the very best for the future bro... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>

<p>My workshop partner in 1-2....it has been a long time having worked with him in any lab...yet i still remember the days we spent working together in workshop....I must say I had a great time with you then....A silent worker that he is....(I was the one who used to speak more than you in workshop :P) he is very hardworking and sincere....a dedicated member of the dance club Amit is a wonderful dancer....I consider myself fortunate to have met a person like him and to have him as a fellow classmate and friend....Hope to stay in touch with you...Good luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Yo bhaand!!! first guy in the corridor with laptop -- that's how it started. Remember how we all came to your room to watch a movie on 2nd or 3rd day itself (we were not even formally introduced), that you don't even want to watch. But you were too reluctant to say No, BTW that one thing has not changed and is same even today.
Definitely not a way to start friendship, but we have come a long way from that. Everyone knows your are a great designer, photoshoper, dancer blah blah... so I'd leave that part, but what really amazes me is the way you manage your life among dance family, friends and 'extended friends' (:D). I'll never forget all the funny and the weird things we did (fan sahi karwa de room ka, thand nahi lagegi). all those trips where you came along, or even when you didn't come (thanks anyway for the digi-cam :P), were awesome. Say one thing against bolly movies or Shahid to him, and that would be the last thing you'd able to say. I'd never understand your love for CAMrip prints (dvd ka to wait kar liya kar :P)
The guy who lives life on his own terms, dude you gonna have a great life ahead. All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sagar-birla">Sagar birla</a></p>
<p>Amit is not just a friend, he's smthng more than dat, he's a companion, confidant, advisor, moral supporter and 'yes' the best friend i ever had :D It was only before the last sem that i met him first(cant deny but it was the wierdest and most awkward meeting i ever had with anyone in my life ;) :) ).. He was always the fun loving kind of person and has lived life on his own terms. I never got a chance to work with him but as far as i know & have seen him, he's an awsome dancer & damn gud at photoshops & similar softwares. He undoubtedly has very good management skills and does manages everything too well... He always gives his best shot at whatever he tries, dats what actually matters... His honesty, sincerity and exceptionally high patience level sets him apart from the crowd....He's a die heart fan of bollywood and d most filmi person i have ever known. I doubt if there's even a single muvi that he has not seen!!!! Apart from all this he is always a very simple guy, who always respects others feelings, always too shy to say no, to deny something... At times he under-estimates himself a lot, but a little motivation always works ;)( and yes always too lazy when he has to start something :P).... But then everyone has a weaker side & in his case they dont matter coz his better side dominates it all...I never remember him showing attitude of being arrogant with anyone!!!! He knows very well how to deal with people...
I give much credit to Amit for helping me 'come out of my shell'.Amit is very easy to talk to, listens well, always has good advice, has a good sense of humor, and has strong family ties... With time my respect for him has grown deeper and stronger. Today he's the first person I think of calling with good news and the first one I call when I need help to get through the day. We talk through the situation 
and by the end of the conversation I feel better about myself.  I know I have choices and don't always make the right ones. It's nice to have a friend like him to help walk through them.  No matter what he's doing, he is willing to listen and give advice, putting all his priorities aside  to help a friend in need. You will always be a lifetime friend and wish u all d best for your bright future....

<p>Amit was in my MT 2 group (the only silent worker in our group :P). And the only person who used to work sincerely when rest of the group members were busy doing time pass (including me :P:P ).  He is hard-working , soft spoken and a great dancer! I will always cherish the wonderful time I had during MT2.  I wish you all the best in future endeavours.

<p>“Mere dimaag se hi nikal gaya ki aaj copy bhi kar sakte the”, “feel nahi aa rahi hai yaar”, “marks ka lalach nahi karna chahiye”, “YE KYA HAI? TUJHE ORDER DENA HAI YA NAHI AAJ? YA JAU MAIN?”. If there is one person who can write and deliver all of these lines with utmost easiness, make the awesomest poster for a movie with these lines, act and choreograph its dance, and then sit in his room and watch its CamRIP, it has to be Amit Bhalerao! :D Yes, he is multihued, really adult like: “koi sense hi nahi bana raha hai tu samja na” at some times and extremely weird and senseless at others. Very very lazy and lethargic when it comes to outings (yaar bahar jaakar kya karna hai?!), happy with himself and enjoys life in a way very few people do. In the past 2 odd years, I haven’t seen him complain about his life even once. Freedom, chill, patience, shaanti, sense, liberty are the adjectives which perfectly describe him. And he epitomises all of them. All hell would have broken loose, but Amit’s mind would still be calm and unperturbed, probably thinking which Bollywood movie he can relate this to :P . Bollywood ka bahot bada fan, shahrukh aur shahid ko koi gaali de to dil par le leta hai, aur koi dialogue bolte hue aapne ek word miss kar diya, toh bolta hai “chal be, aise nahi hai” aur exact word to word sunata hai. PJ’s toh iske khoon mein hain. Hum jaise chhote log pjs sochkar maarte hain. In janab ko pata nahi chalta kab ine mooh se PJ nikal jaata hai. Paise ke mamle mein bahot strong hai, jitna jaroorat bas utna hi spend karta hai. Aur bahott talented banda hai, saala jo sochta hai, kar deta hai.. yaar matlab khud se koi itna fodu photoshop seekh kaise sakta hai (haan isne hi banaye hain Waves 2011 Logo and Permanent logo waha PS mein aadhe adhoore net par raat ko 3-4 baje tak NRJ ke sath baithkar)! Wo bhi accent waale tuts sunkar jinka volume vlc ke 10% se oopar hi nahi jata! Dance mein ekdum machaxxx to hai hi!
Baaki bahot dedicated aur hardworking hai. Jis kaam mein mann lagata hai, wo fir kitna hi ho jaye chhodta nahi hai. Yaar tere bina to mera DoJMA aur Waves ka aadha kaam atak jaata. Waves 2010 rulebook to hoti hi nahi kabhi. Time mast manage karta hai tu aur taane bhi bahot li8ly sun leta hai :P Ek aur bahut badi cheez. Apne saath pata nhi kya par ek bahot jyada positive energy carry karta hai, matlab socha hua ho ki aaj to isko aate hi gaaliya sunani hai, par aane ke 5 min mein toh tu hi hasata hoga haemin. Bahot aspirations bhi rakhta hai zindagi se, aur uske liye mehnat bhi poori karna chahta hai. I hope kit u life mein bhi machaxx karde aise hi, and thanks for everything! Ob touch mein to rahega, nahi to “tera kya hoga re kaaliya?” :P
