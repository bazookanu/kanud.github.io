<p>Year 2025 !!!!!  "" A mundane sunday morning. Over a cup of tea,in some remote corner of India I am flitting through the Sunday Daily. Pages turned and Yo what I see made my day !!! Amit Goel ~ The Guru of all investment bankers "" Ha Ha !!! ye phoda khalu ne .... ....... .... .... ... ... ... I recalled it correct, for it was Workshop Lab where I first met you and your comment about me when i recall now " ye chutia kaun hain" was drop dead hilarious . Our friendship grew stronger over time and more stronger during last lecture of the day "4-5" prob stat classes in 1-1 and evening @ bogmalo followed by the class . Two months straight going to Bogmalo on every M-W-F series for no reason I loved it.. Remember!!!  filling your Blue Bag with tuborg bottles and learning to smoke a cig with you !!! :) :)  Time changed and you too for good !!! And with 3rd year setting in, It was a ride of life.. Those numerous bike trips, Whole Goa in one day Tour, visits to Martins, claudi's etc etc . Because of you I realized how beautiful the tandoori chicken.. Moments to be cherished for an entire lifetime...  It was fun growing as a person with you, your advices on life and you are the one who taught me to value money ( pakka baniya hain tu  :p) .... I won't call u a phodu, but a person who is utterly smart with a mind blowing IQ and mathematics your darling !!!!! You saved me in Opre.. :) :)
Right adjective for you "" Chhote Packet Ka Gola Bum Hain Tu ""'  .. I wish you good luck and bahut zyada success.. Jaha Bhi jaaye phod phaad macha dena... Kudos and god Bless... !!!!

<p>Wohooo !!!! Yaroon Dosti badi hi hanseen hai, ye na hoto hmm ........ Amit yaar kitni baar suna hai ya gana aoor bas tere lie samajhta hun kya bolna chata hai wo . First time met u in mess. There was not a fc***** person on the earth to lend me a ear when i met u. Just a lill attention from U made me blurt out all my feelings staright and i remember u said "bada aacha banda hai yaar tu". Gosh how much i bless the guy who took his transfer from ur room... First time to panjim on a maruti with Pascal. How can we forget that ?? And then followed some of most stable moments of my life. Within one year of our friendship we cracked a whole north india trip in just 5k OMG OMG . Ob he is "goel".How do u find cheapest prices on net ??? Ping Amit goel. One of the most genuine person on campus with a deep deep understanding of people's emotions. I praise his analytical mind with magnanimous intensity and trust his decisions completely . His words on any analysis are BIBLE to me. And ya if u wanna go somewhere and cant plan ur travel, he will undoubtedly "make ur trip". . I can practically say we both were,are riding on the same boat. Went through a most unproductive phase of our life together, in a re********** together. I am too happy for he found out his interests, and forever will i encourage him. Our frequencies have a wonderful match. As most people have bad times he too had, nothing new. Whts to note is the effort he gave to "come back to life" and the person he was after that. F*** U wont believe ur eyes if u had seen the transformation. Whenver comes a low phase in my life i look upto him as my inspiration. Rarely have a seen a LOVE so genuine. Whenver I need a buddy he is always at my disposal, always. He is a friend indeed whos always there in need and no-need. To all people I can bet one thing u will never regret in your life is association with him. When I see his future I rarely can see his face coz the view is all green and its all hari hari patti. In the future his voice on my ears will lighten up a smile that no author can put in words . I know success walks hands in hands with you and ur associates are the most loved ones . God loves me . :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/souvik-dutta">Souvik Dutta</a></p>
