<h1 class="page-title">Amit Kumar Jha</h1><p>Unbelievable, I am the first one to write for Amit.
Amit Bhai, what to say... this man is awesome. Never saw this guy with his head down, stressed out or without his calming smile. An attitude i wish every person in the world had. His words, "I do what makes me happy", made me a real fan of him. He has honed his talents and is a amazing guitar and flute player. Always good for small and fun talk when you need one. I really regret not being a part of your epic trips and i really am glad having know you. Keep up that attitude in life man and you shall succeed. 
I feel proud while quoting "Stress and Amit cannot coexist." - Mitesh Tulsiyan<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>Amit kumar jha ke kya kehne…ekdum mast insaan hai…ekdum chill rehta hai koi tension nahi what-so-ever …certainly my first choice for a  person to hang out with ( sad part is we haven’t got any chance since PS1 :| )…has a gr8 taste in music...plays guitar brilliantly…and also owns  a very good voice…miss those days in PS…those long walks to the restaurant, every evening basketball khelna, mahi ke maze lena :P, those arguments on silly things, Hari Raj ke chhole bhature, Indira chowk ki chaat, jhaad patti ( u know what I mean :P…was my first and the only tym :D…thank u for dat :P )…teacher ke saamne gaali dena aur daant khaana :P I cherish all those memories we made!!!. Amit is a very helpful, kindhearted and sweet person. It’s so much fun to hangout with him. His passion for music and music instruments is undoubtedly extraordinary and he learns them ridiculously fast. He can relentlessly work on a music instrument for hours. I wish u a gr8 future and hope….u get all, u wish for…Cheers !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-jain">Rahul Jain</a></p>
<p>Amit is the JAAN of a group when in full flow. He's got these tremendous bursts of energy that keep you both enthralled and entertained. And as long as you don't wake him up from his sleep (or take his flute out of his room :-P), he shall continue to maintain that state of serene happiness.
He has also bravely taken up the job of drilling into me some musical sense.
He has been primarily unsuccessful, on occasion pulling the flute/guitar right outta my hand. In his hand the same flute makes music that in my hand makes noise. Music comes very naturally to him and he his ability to pickup instruments is almost astounding!
One of the most incredible things about him is his unpredictability. With him you never know what to expect. One day he's preparing for GRE, the next he's on a movie marathon, a third day he's almost meditating on his flute, the next he's practically flying outta his room to go to the north for a fishing trip.
I don't know where his life will take him, but I am sure it'll be something where Amit will be happy.

<p>golu!! is another contender from my li8 friends list.We had a great time during our ps1 and a musical one too.i remember sitting in hostel and making non veg jingles ,me singing in fake voices and your fabulous guitar playing.Amit cheer's me up every time i meet him as he gives me hope that li8ness is for eternity.He is very passionate about music and movies which makes our friendship an equally likely event.He is also focused in life as he exactly knows the things he does not want to do such as  studies or further studies. He is smart,witty  has his own opinion on things and is a great guy to hangout with.Dude i am gonna chesish the time we spent in and off campus.All the best man,i know hamara kuch na kuch to ho hi jayega!!!!!

<p>Amit Kumar Jha, a man of few words and the god of small things. He is the one person who will open the door and give you a snickers bar at 3am for when you are down and out. Forever willing to share, his infinite supply of food and love has filled our hearts many a night, with reverence for him. His musical abilities are unquestionable, his rhetoric's undeniable and his friends innumerable. He had a story for your every doubt, a song and a snicker for all your sad days, and an adventure to make your every day a little brighter.
Some have even claimed that he is Krishna reborn, what with his flute, his irresistible charms and his disarming smile. Talking about Amit a quote comes to my mind,
"He that spareth his words hath knowledge; A man of understanding is even-tempered." -Proverbs 17:27[Bible]
Cheers to the innumerable adventures, fights, drinking sessions and the longest debates ever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/debanjum-singh-solanky">Debanjum Singh Solanky</a></p>
<p>Although we started of on a slightly wrong foot but thanks to the MT-2 lab group, Amit and I were able to become good friends. When I actually knew him in my MT-2 lab I realized that he was a fun person to talk to... He speaks less and does whatever work is given to him pretty sincerely I must say (we worked in most of the electrical labs together and thanks to him we were able to get through all the tedious experiments then)...Apart from just the labs Amit is also my classmate... and being in the same department for almost a year he is one guy I have always seen remain cheerful all the time... he is very sure of what he wants to do in life further unlike some of us and I hope that this takes him a long way ahead.... To sum it all I had a splendid time knowing you as a friend. Wish you all the luck and may you achieve all the success in your life and come out with flying colors making people around you not just proud but also happy as you always do :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Three Words: Love this Guy. From the initially sobre person to one the biggest entertainers to the cranky lil girl he has become, I've had the opportunity to see many sides of this guy over the past 3 years. From the ecstasy of Snickers to the joyous midnight brawls, each moment is almost an incident with Amit. But incidents that will be firmly etched in my mind. His blunt humour coupled with an attitude that defines lite-ness and a command of Hindi that is befitting of his Bihari heritage, Amit packs a pataka into a small "brawny" package. His generosity with money and chocolates is quite affable and often laughable but has made for some great moments in our group. A gem with the guitar and a genie with the Bansuri, hope you actually make some concrete use of your musical talents one day. Guess we all wouldn't be the same without you. You will be surely missed. Have fun in PS2 and hope you have a great life ahead. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
