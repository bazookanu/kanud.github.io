<h1 class="page-title">Amit Kumar</h1><p>Of the closest friends i have in BITS. Fun to be around. And of course...the so many journeys we have had together, especially the one to aguada fort :)
From his organic studies in 1st sem and movies on his old lappi to his moti frame waala chashma which he wears currently and his-always-ready-to-go-out attitude - all  \m/ .
Mast helpful banda, had awesome times. And how can't i mention his comedic tactics...itni baar bola phir bhi saale ne ek show nahi kiya.maybe in the future.
Thoda si baat pachane ki dikkat hai, par you can bear that :P
There are endless things i can write, but i guess its not required.
Hope you go and do what u want...All The Best :)
And keep doing your comedy :D
PS. Phir milenge. One last trip left though.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>Bhilai, as he is fondly known in the hostel, my next-door neighbour, is one person I know with genuine interest in studying Mechanical Engineering. He does so well without studying too much is testimony to that fact. Is very up-to-date about any new technology in the market and takes a keen interest in acquiring more knowledge about it. A very friendly and helpful person. A true Punjabi at heart.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Amit Kumar ka isshtlye to hatke hai - Bhilai ka tadka :P Once Amit told me and I quote "Arvind, yaar apna weight kam kar, warna teri SHAADI kaise hogi". OMG ROFLMAO, this is just one of the million epic things he says in normal conversations :P He has a strong grasp of his subjects and once he makes up his mind to top them, no1 can stop him :P I had the privilege of being his lab partner in TP-II, well he should be thankful for my readings (he used to start writing his report 10 min b4 submission). Dude to aap hain hi, with a little less Salman Khan attitude you are all set for an awesome life and a shining future. Enjoy and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Bhilai/ Bhillu. As he is fondly called by all of us is one of the most carefree people ive ever come across. His interest in mechanical engineering exceeds the ordinary. He is very helpful and is a person that you can bank on. A generous guy by nature ( which is obvious due to all the food he shares with us, anytime) he is one of the nicest people in the campus. Only a few know that he is also an excellent mimic with his mimicry ranging from celebs to teachers to our batch-mates. Ill miss the light hearted moments I've shared with him and also our pre and post test conversations. All the very best for the future! Cheers!! :) And Btw it was me who gave you the names Bhilai and Bhillu! ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/hemant-bhatt">Hemant Bhatt</a></p>
<p>Amit aka Bhilia got his name from me and Hemant as the only thing he talks about in his early days was about Bhilai.  In first year his aim was to have a great body like Salman Khan but unfortunately  he got a "tummy"  which he likes very much.
The thing that I like the most about Bhilai is his simplicity and his stupidness. His idiotic behaviour  has given us all  very precious memories which we will never forget in our entire life. Bhilu being friends with you has been  amazing .  I am surely going to miss you . All the best for your life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tushar-mandar">Tushar Mandar</a></p>
