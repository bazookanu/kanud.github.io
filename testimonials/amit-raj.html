<h1 class="page-title">Amit Raj</h1><p>Bapu, as he is called in the hostel, is one guy who is always right :P. A die-hard Manchester United fan and a sports fanatic. Watching matches in the common room wouldn't have been the same if he wasn't there to impart his gyan. Very intelligent and knowledgeable. It has been a pleasure knowing you BoB.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Amit Raj! As I type out this name, I realize that it sounds very bhaari - Raj and all :)
I met this being at our PS station at WAT Consult. We had some fun times there. He has been my bro ever since! This great guy has a heart of gold. He is a very warm, lovable and a soft spoken guy. Has multiple achievements to his name. Was always my staunch supporter in Nadal vs Fed battles. Watches every sport match being aired. Scores well in subjects and yet I see him around on campus everywhere!
His help and support has been really wonderful and I am thankful to him for that. His PJ"s are a class apart and always bring a smile. He is a real gem of a person and I wish him all the very best for every future endeavours of his life!
Stay the same, don't ever change Amit Raj (Oh yes, its really bhaari!) 
Cheers,

<p>Amit. Every time he cracks one of his PJ's i feel like banging my head on the wall!! Apart from that, he is an awesome guy (yes Amit! it means your PJ's not awesome..Actually far away from awesome :P).He is genuine, compassionate, a bit too emotional :P, and  can always be counted on to listen and provide support when needed. He has been a great friend all along.
It’s been a pleasure getting to know you Amit :)
All the best!!

<p>The Bapu of our hostel....your unique style of talking had left me baffled the first time I met you (sometimes still couldn't make out what you say :P). Ar ardent sports fan, you are interested in watching every single sport that runs on TV (even if it is as boring as golf). You were a great hostel rep and  have always been a gem of our hostel. You have been great in acads and also as an active member of CEL. It was real fun being friends with you and I hope you remember me in your future too....Wish you a very successful life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Amit Raj aka Bapu aka Chhotu aka BoB, As it was rightly raised in a hostel meeting, Bapu never gives the remote controller to anyone when hes in the common room! ;), Jokes apart, he is one of the most awesome people in campus ,  an ardent manchester united, nadal, vettel (..the list goes on forever..) fan, his knowledge in sports is unparalleled. I've been with this guy since first year and its been a treat! , may it be studying opti, cl classes or bogmalo times ! His sense of humor is out of the world, i mean it! You know i'll always admire you for it! :D.  Its always a lost cause getting into a war of words with Bapu, thats exactly why he has never been on the receiving side of Ranchi Jokes unlike Pranky (who, i might add , was weaker at heart) .  Bapu, its been an awesome journey so far, and its only going to get better! 
PS. Kabhi kabhi remote bhi de diya kar yaar ! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>

I wish him loads of luck and success in life. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Amit Raj or Bapu, as he is popularly known in our hostel. Who can forget his impromptu pj's, some that would crack you up and some that would be below the poverty line :P. He is virtually the remote control of the tv set in the common room. Koi bhi match chal raha ho, bapu to rahega hi wahan pe. I have hardly seen him ever miss anything,. He has enormous knowledge when it comes to sports. As a person he's fun to be around. He'll always help you out if you go to him. He's very humble and down to earth. One of the few people who actually manages acads with other extra curricular activities very well. It's been a pleasure knowing you. All the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>

<p>Bapu!! This guy got his name as Bapu bcos he doesnt mind giving out his own team members while playing gully cricket in our hostel. A fellow sports lover, this guy's enthusiasm and passion towards it is unparalleled. watching matches with him was a pleasure with him acting as my google search engine on stats. His disgusting PJs make the experience of common room more memorable. He has also established a monopoly over the remote over which again we had our disagreements. We also fight over sports as we both support rival sport figures except nadal. Inspite of dedicating so much time to sports, this guy does not neglect his studies and his sharp intellect makes acads a cakewalk for him. He is really dedicated towards Finance and Entrepreneurship and im sure he will have a successful life<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>

<p>Bapu! The custodian of the remote control :D. I have known him for close to 3 years now and he certainly makes for a great company.A permanent fixture in the Common Room.Watches and follows practically every sport(even Golf!). A die-hard Man Utd fan (still remember that celebration of yours when Man Utd won the the Manchester Derby 4-3 back in the first year!).Also a Nadal fan. And Vettel. And Woods. The list is endless.A good coder and an equally good manager.Instrumental in taking CEL to greater heights. Did a very good job as Hostel Rep in our second year. An enthusiastic Gully Cricket Player.Makes good use of the pitch should I say :P. His word is often the final one (not much point in arguing :P). Cracks horrible PJ's! A proud Ranchi-ite(Is that what they are called?).All in all, a really amazing person and a true friend.Wish you the best of luck Bapu.A great future awaits you :)
 Do stay in touch.Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>
<p>Amit is one of thee most special people present. His category is in fact hard to find. The sort who is really really intelligent and is equally caring a person! As smart as he is, so is he dedicated. Rather focused. He knows priority and is of the rare species who is punctual. If all of this sounds boring, beat this, that he is equally into sports. Any sport u pick up and he knows everything about it! He speaks so passionately when it comes to sports!!! 
Above all, he is the sort who will do all the "behind the stage work" without even making a fuss or complaining!   Taking care of every minute detail and assuring the smooth working of things, Amit is like the perfect role model to have!!!! (Minus all his hopeless PJs!!!!! Alert: stay away from amit when he is on a PJthon with Parth!!!! They leave no sense for sense or humor!!! :P )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yashu">Yashu</a></p>
<p>pranam babu! he is one of the most down to earth person i know on campus! witty ( just not when cracking jokes :P ) , compassionate and soft spoken! ((dude ur email id is nadal. something :P kab banaya tha boss? 8th standard :P  )) speaks way too fast and i am sure many people are left far behind in ur conversations :P i gotta stay in touch with so tha just incase some day weight transfer is something realistic, hum donno ka problem solve ho jaye !! :P  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apurva-mudgal">Apurva Mudgal</a></p>
<p>Abbe Manchester United harega ! If he hears remotely anywhere close to him, he shall kill that person and convince the crowd how awesome ManUnited is. When I had seen him first, I used to think what kind of a kid is this which sticks to the television set the whole day seeing some sport. But truly he is the Wikipedia of sports ! Ask him about where Ronaldo scored or when was the last time this team won or lost, and you a reply in seconds.  He follows every sport genuinely, sits alone in common room but doesnt give up. Those matches in common room and bapu's constant updates about the stats shall be cherished for life and I shall miss those times. When he is in common room, you dare not ask for the remote, he changes it keeping him updated with every score at the present moment. Oh wait and he studies too, a good cg with so much passion for sports is truly appreciable. His facial expressions are unique ( dusty's are epic ) be it will playing cricket after he has taken a wicket or a catch. His PJs are unique and always bring smile, track some new ones Torres started to score now ! Its been a treat to share the same hostel with you man ! 

I hope you become a sports analyst one day, or ManUnited Manager ? :P Good luck for future ! 

PS. Ch1 mein remote room par mat leke jana, bahut bada hostel he bhai ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Amit->Bak Raj->Baks->Bakku.

Certainly, how he crept into the group despite his pathetic jokes speaks of his qualities. He has been my fondest junior till date and as I write this he will be thinking of something to irritate me or the big guy. Any amount of help, any kind of help, Bkas will be there. He has selflessly served CEL for all these 3 these years in BITS and has a good fan following there. Will randomly call anytime, walk into my room and force me to see a MAN U Video, however plain and non celebrating it might be while discussing about his interaction or altercations with his lovable friends. I am impressed by his dedication and interest in sports and that too all kind of sports from the high voltage ones to post retirement ones: P 

His transformation from lazy studious kid to the recent suave dhinchaak dude is for a good. But what I am completely mesmerized is his ability to score well in all subjects despite his nonchalant attitude to most of the things in life. Bakku has been a source of randomest of sports trivia and campus news. He is the person who can never disappoint and is certainly made for bigger feats in life. Boy who can physically assault if Man-U loses reflects his lunacy. And yeah, I enjoy the epic expression of his when Man U or Vettel loses.

Bakku has slowly became a part of the Yo! Group, numerous outings, subject of insane jokes, and lazy drinks partner to the Big Guy. His uncanny abilities of faking SMS exchanges as E-mail for an hour, the Bakwaas chat sessions, arguments over his esteemed coterie of folks, countering every point of mine will be missed. 

I wish and am sure that he will do Sports management from his dream institution and become one of the mascots of sports arena.
