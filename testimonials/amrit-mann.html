<h1 class="page-title">Amrit Mann</h1><p>Amrit is one of the most friendly people on campus. A gigantic stature and personality to match :D It's always a pleasure talking to him. He's very good at a lot of things - football, astronomy, physics, mechanical, counter strike... the list goes on. Plus, he's extremely humble! Wherever he goes, he's bound to be very successful. It's been wonderful knowing you, Amrit. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>

<p>calm, easy going, hard working and more or less a simple guy. Retiring early from the campus :P
you can be either pleased or be absolutely disgusted with his sense of humor. But he still manages to share a laugh and thats what counts :)

<p>Amrit has always followed his heart and this has always led him to success in life. A fun loving and helpful friend, who wants to everyone around him have a smile on their face.

This being his last sem on campus, he will be one whom many will miss in their 4th year. All the best for your future. May all your dreams come true!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manoj-malineni">Manoj Malineni</a></p>
<p>I first met him on a football field (you can make out why). He of very few people possesses dual qualities and apart from a footballer and bla bla...... he's a touch cookie, hard to break. He certainly do lots of things (good things ofcourse ;) )  because of which he stands out from rest of the crowd. I wish him all the very best for the future ahead. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>Amrit is one of my best friends on campus. He is extremely brilliant and hardworking. An astronomy and physics nut with a flair for research, I am sure he will make it big in whatever he does. He is one awesome person to hang out with, loads of fun, with his great sense of humor and impulsiveness. He can make anyone laugh, no matter the sadness sorrounding the person.
Amrit has an awesome life ahead of him. I am sure he will make it big. Best of luck bro<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shiva-sood">Shiva Sood</a></p>
<p>Amrit Mann, a huge figure and an even bigger heart. He is one of the finest friends anyone can ever get. In mess he is the guy everyone looks forward to hear stories from. He is the guy always ready to learn something new. He is a great sense of humour and knows how to bang a situation with his jokes. He is the guy you can tell all your secrets to and he will keep them buried in his heart. All in all, he is a great guy living by the side of the bathroom,pissed off with the irritating mobile connection and lets it all out in the football match :P He is a great sportsman especially Cricket and Football. He is the kind of guy whom not only me but everyone will remember even 20-30 years from now. I wish him a great and successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>With his gigantic structure, he far overshadows me, but he is one of the most friendliest persons u know, especially with his wacky sense of humour. He is intensely career driven and he has already planned his future pretty much. All the best to you, and it was great knowing u :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nithin-s-poduval">Nithin S Poduval</a></p>
<p>Tussi jaa rahe ho? Tussi na jao :( 
I first met Amrit Singh Mann back in my school days in mumbai. I did my 5th std with him. Back then to me he was a fun loving, easy going guy with a great height. I still remember the fun we used to have back then. On my second day on campus I saw him walking with his father with his head down. I recognized him at once and thought that he had turned pretty serious about his life. Turns out I was wrong and thank God for that. He hasn't changed much. He is still the same fun loving and down to earth guy. He gets moody at times and may even fight with for no reason at all. Sometimes you may feel he is still a kid from inside. But that is not entirely true. I have seen his mature side and boy when he gets serious, he will get what he wants. He is confident about himself and a great friend. A great speaker and debater. He is the kind of guy who will take part in all the extra curricular workshops (he may not attend them) but will definitely pay for them. A great CS player and football player. A troll lover (well who isn't) but he maybe more than anyone. You will always enjoy his company and love to be around him. He is the kind  of guy you will remember for a long time. He is one of my closest friends and I am going to miss. All the best for your life ahead and take care bro. Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rajat-koujalagi">Rajat Koujalagi</a></p>
<p>Pro in Astronomy, always looking to achieve his goals and puts in a lot of efforts to achieve them. All the best.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>The only bone of contention between us may be the #elclassico. Otherwise an excellent guy. A brilliant attitude, gung-ho about life while still maintaining his career goals well-crafted. Acts childish once in a month but rest of the time, an awesome friend to hang out with. A true football fan (because he does not participate in #gayfrisbee) and a subdued Blaugrana fan. His slow and sombre steps gives him the looks of a 'dad' but he is indeed one in astronomy. Does a plethora of projects. His CV might be 3-4 times longer than those of us. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kushal-kr-das">Kushal Kr Das</a></p>
<p>what can i say, there are lots of things about this guy and i don't even know where to begin, "crazy" is one word which describes him best :P,there are hardly any guys in the campus who i know more than him, i've know him since 7th standard, long time i know, we were separated during two years in high school but then we were reunited here again,fate i guess (and i'm not trying to act gay here :P ) ,anyways these three years with him and my other friends have been the three best years of my life, you just can't get enough of his PJ's,which seem to reach a peek when he is high (on maaza mind you,lol),i'll never forget the n number of times we ate at claudies this time getting high on cheese naan and would return to campus so full that we would almost throw up, and ofcourse who can forget our soccer evenings and our very own striker,who seems to giving a tough competition to torres these days :P, the best way to describe our friendship would be the movie "dumb and dumber", who is "dumber" is a hot topic of debate though :D, all said and done amrit is one of my greatest pals,an overall great guy to hang out with and i assure you when you are around him you'll never be bored, you'll probably be busy laughing your ass off :D,Cheers to our friendship mate...now bitch go make me a sandwich :P :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustoov-dutta">Koustoov Dutta</a></p>
<p>Bargad ka ped ( coz of his height ), as I used to call him during the early days of our frndshp, he is simply a great guy and is pure at heart. In frnt of him we all look like some 5th grader or so. He has been a great helping hand to me in many of my academic works. A football enthusiast (player as well as supporter) and a physics genius ( despite having mechanical branch), he is gonna complete his 4 yr degree in just 3 and a half yrs ( well, I still dnt knw whether itâ€™s a correct decision or not). Also, he is still like a small kid despite his 6ft+ height. ? . I wish him a good luck for his prolific career ahead.  And plz thodi lambi ladki dhoondiyo ( I hope u understand :P) . have fn and enjoy life bro!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>
<p>Met this guy during the initial days while playing carrom . Seemed to be a sharp which no doubt he is . The first thing you would notice about this guy is his laughter , you would want to crack more and more jokes just to hear him laughing . He looks big but is a kid from inside . Awesome gamer , especially cs . One of his characteristics is that he gets irritated very fast and we always try to push the limits with him . He is kinda foodi ( loves cheese nan ) , likes going out to eat . We have had some magical moments in campus man , be it the DJ ni8s or late ni8 food , the mess or the fun we had in the cc while posting crap on somebody's profile who forgot to logout :D . A good footballer and his imitation of Jim Carrey is just awesome , wont forget it . I like him saying " Himanshu , meri kyu le raha hai " :D . This guy has also acheived a lot in acads , wont go in detail but the sad part is that he has finished his tenure in campus and would be leaving . You have no idea how much ppl will miss you . But I hope you keep doing well wherever you go and keep growing . All the best for life man \m/ Cheers   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>

<p>Amritpal Singh Mann is it? :D 
Things which describe Amrit are -an awesome Padosi, dedicated and sincere to whatever he does, friendly to all, a pro footballer and a true "Courage the Cowardly Dog" fan :o). Nicks himself as Godgamer :O. y? (always defeated you in pocket tanks :P), but seriously speaking a gaming enthusiast and good CS player. 
Tere no-logic jokes are seriously pathetic.( i'll suggest your last elective applications here :P). Will surely miss you man be it our infinite visits to shopco, football games, the never ending layers of cheese naan :D, waiting endlessly for you to finish eating in mess :x, oh wait wont miss the last part :D. Was great to have you as friend :)
All the best for future. May the hugely disfigured "Bitch Please" drawn by you remain there forever :P.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nitish-sinha">Nitish Sinha</a></p>
