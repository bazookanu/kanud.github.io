<h1 class="page-title">Amrit Pal</h1><p>Amrit ,
 At a initial glance,defines antisocial self obsessed  maniac on the loose . Sleeps all day and does no good . Huge pretentious little prick.

Ok, Now ,  take that statement and slam it down so hard that it will somehow invert itself. Here is the truth . This guy is an absolute maniac , spark of genius, as diplomatic and reserved person i have known. His doing no good or what we prefer calling "LUKKHA TAEMPASS" is the over the top insane , no kidding In fucking sane !
Think international delegations and the like. Thiss tiny bizwizzkid has his fingers stuck up the place you will not imagine , the stuff we end up reading in Forbes et al.
Only on  word to describe his professional endeavours RESPECT !

As  a friend this is one person you can turn to for advice ! Shit you not this guy will give you the best advice from anyone in BITS in he stickiest spots. Great variety of choice and interests you will always be amazed at the stuff his guy comes up with be it Micro-finance (:D ) or EPL chatter or Megan Fox outfits. Complete gadgetophile .
I wish him great luck on his pursuits and future . I am sure it will be kickass. Hopefully I will be fortunate to work with him someday .

<p>You can always trust Amrit to have intelligent conversations with. Or conversations on just about anything. It's like there's a mini-wikipedia in his head. He's always been highly focused on what he loves, and amazingly updated on pretty much everything. He's being doing what he likes, even though it's pretty tough to take that path. (microfinance after chemical engg, c'mon!) Amazing ability to connect and communicate with people. Headstrong, passionate, dynamic... that's how you describe him. I'm sure somewhere out there, 20 years from now, he'll be making a big difference to people.

And yeah, this guy also has an epic music collection. Check out his last.fm profile.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Amrit in a few words is a guy with a brilliant mind and a brilliant smile. He is always ready to share his knowledge with you and help you out. Within a few conversation with him you get so inspired and motivated.  He has a great taste in books, so if you are looking forward to reading a great book he is the person you should contact.From what i know of him,he is a man of ideals and has his opinions of every subject. He has great convincing power as well. I can never thank him enough for introducing me to social media, it got me in touch with some brilliant people out there.
I wish you him all the luck and success, i am sure he will do great in his life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>I've not known Amrit for long, at least not personally. But on the basis of whatever little interaction I've had with him, I can say for sure that he is one of the most, and forgive my absolute lack of creativity here, awesome people this campus has ever produced. Five minutes of interaction with him leaves you with a world of insight and knowledge you couldn't have gathered from anywhere else, and there isn't a topic under the sun that you can't talk to him about. It's been a privilege to know him, to be counted in the same team as him, and I sincerely hope that we'll be able to work together in the future.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-vikas">Akshay Vikas</a></p>
<p>I first spoke to Amrit in my first year, but never really interacted much. After I met him this year, I can say that he is one of the most inspiring people I have ever met. I greatly respect his knowledge and totally admire his attitude towards everything. He introduced me to quite a number of things that I wasn't aware of and they have surely created a difference. Thanks a lot for everything and I am eager to start working on our project.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-pant">Aniket Pant</a></p>
<p>Pal babu has been the best sidey one can hope for in BITS. Though I cant pretend to be his best friend or even a close friend ( Cause he likes living in his own world surrounded by his Lappy, Kindle and lots of books) I can still say he is the most awesome guy I have ever met. The only other guy in our hostel perhaps who never sleeps at night apart from me  Its been an honor discussing entrepreneurship, Family guy, Post rock,  Politics( and what not) with him and one doesn't need to be a genius to figure out that he is perhaps the most knowledgeable guy in our campus. Doesn't give a damn about acads but has been really passionate about the things he like. He revived our good old CEL. The late night maggies are the most I would remember about him. Thanks for letting me borrow all your books and all the best for your future.

<p>There is this guy who is Secretary of CEL, writes for Socialter, founder of SocialWeYou, and going to Boston for StartingBloc this is all that i heard about you before actually meeting which left me completely spellbound. I remember i talked to you for the first time regarding the concept of permission marketing in shop co. Since then we have had many discussions, and almost all have left some impression on me. All the red wine and the dinners with you have been a pleasure because of your unique choice of menu. Watching ted talks, top gear show and other stuff was also a gr8 experience. His knowledge about different fields is surely commendable. Do remember me while executing the 'shack for bitsians' plan in goa :) . As your CEL t shirt quoted insight > info , you are the cauldron of insight and information.Thanks a lot for everything , will surely like to continue this friendship forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akhil-singh">Akhil Singh</a></p>
<p>This guy simply amazing. Down to earth, clear about what he wants to do, and a pure genius...as they call it.
 Start-ups, microfinance or anything in generally, and he's the guy I go to. There were times when I went to his room at 12:30 at night to discuss some stupid idea that I had and he would patiently hear me out . His advice ,opinions ,suggestions have been truly 
priceless. Thanks for being a great friend and mentor.
Wish you all the luck for all your future endeavors. =)

<p>Amrit Pal is one of the persons in this world who you can never forget after meeting him even once. For me he has been a great friend mainly from the PS1 we had together. From then this guy with his unique style of living, epic choices with respect to evrything be it from food menus to sleeping habits has been unique and inspiring. He is a kind of a guy you cannot get bored with. We have had amazing chats together and more to that he introduced me to TOP GEAR. One of the most inspiring guys i have ever met with tons of enthusiasm and unbounded knowledge and love for books this guy has a long way to go. Live the same life and believe me our plans for having a shack in goa will be der sooner or later. Stay the same. Would like to taste your "sauf wine" some day. Best of luck for future.. Enjoy Nairobi. ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranay-agrawal">Pranay Agrawal</a></p>
<p>For most of the guys, there are two opinions about Amrit - a) He is elite b) He knows too much and too many. But I can vouch for the second and my opinion about the first is different. He has been one of the fondest people around in BITS. From the random meeting in Library till date, this has been epic time discussing almost everything under the sun, sharing opinions, different perceptions, innumerable outings, and information. Despite having so much of information, I have never seen him basking in glory and is arguably the best mentor for juniors in BITS. I am completely amazed by his respect for people around him and that is one of the prime reasons for impressive list of accolades in a short time. We did have some interesting differences that continue to hold but as Amrit puts up we need to agree to disagree. And in hindsight it has strengthened the bonding we have. He is one guy who is weird, but can never bore you. With his peculiar taste in everything from Coffee to wine, he is an interesting guy when it comes to shopping and his tales evading cops in Central Park and Delhi metro are legend now: P

I had a couple of discussions with him where I delved into his more humane side, his secret bonding with some special people in his life and his ambition for them. Respect for him has grown largely for his candidness and his way of balancing things in life. He is (and mark my words) will surely make it to the league of notable BITSians, whatever field it is. After all, it has to be lean: P Life after BITS will surely be missed for Coffee sessions, early morning tea discussions, chats, weird arguments, Anurag Kashyap, fond for good ambiance and many things that we realize in its absence.  And yes, you are one person whom I want in my team.
