<p>Of all the troubled times that life in this campus had to offer, you are most definitely a saving grace. Back in the first semester, when you very thoughtfully gave me this Sidney Sheldon book, the realization that this was gonna be huge and different struck me. And from then inspite of the several upheavals we've had,it was all worth it. Without any exaggeration you are one of the most selfless persons I've ever met.  Beginning of each year when you come armed with these personalized gifts,speaks volumes about the kind of attention that you pay to our likes and dislikes. The glorious past we've had,the tumultuous present we are in and the voracious appetite we have has brought us close over the last three years. It is just amazing the way you help people without never expecting anything in return. You are this one person with whom I can share a meaningful silence without any need for small talk. One of the fondest memories that I shall forever carry with me are our very own trip to Majorda, when you were blissfully happy about finding a packet of Lays, given the circumstances. I find myself very fortunate to be one of the very few who have seen a Amulya very different from her usual portrayal. The way you lifted  my spirits and yet let me indulge in the self loathing sessions shall never be forgotten.  I truly respect you for your take on all the things of the world. The nonchalance with which you treat the creative being in you brings about a sense of humility in me. I shamefacedly admit that being with you makes me feel guilty for not being able to give back in the same measure. All the "boos" that were never said and all the "schematic diagrams"(pun intended) that you've ever drawn shall bear a testament for this beautiful thing we've had and will hopefully continue to. Cheers!   -S.J.M<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>

<p>To start with, i have to say this... so much for acting pricey woman :-/ See soooo many testimonials before i even got to writing one :P I remember i met you in some special classes for the people who came late in the 1st sem. After that i guess it was our awesomestest PS (very deep sarcasm) :P It really did end up much better than i thought and it was only thanks to the four of you :) The last few days actually did turn out to be fun :P Whether it was giving some well-needed education to those two, or the mindless laughter, the masterchef sessions, the midnight madness accompanied with screaming and phone calls or even singing "Friday" it really did end up being fun finally :D I guess after the whole torture, it was actually worth it because i met you guys (i'm getting too senti :yuck: >.<) The night out at my home was another thing i'll remember and how we all reacted at FSM after eating lasagna :P I guess this was truly being there for each other at the most dire moments of need (though i guess we didn't have any other choice, but still :P) Experienced it all - fights, rebellions, walking through SHIT, starvation, hysteria, etc. You are an awesome and a very creative person and oh yeah fun too!!! Be happy dude :D Here is to Ka****** (couldn't resist :P) May no crow attack you ever again!
P.S: Only one thing though, wish i took apart your laptop :P Regret that :P Also how the hell did you eat in that godforsaken pathetically horrible shitty disgusting mess!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>
