<h1 class="page-title">Anantaram Varatharajan</h1><p>Anantaram came as a total surprise to me . Din know him well before 3-1 except that he was awesome at acads , specially electronics . He was on my Gtalk list but never I thpught of pinging him coz I din want to disturb him . But nowadays , without thinking anything I can write "ssup bitch , shagging !! :D . Dynamics have surely changed :D ........ Need not to mention he is one of the best shuttlers on campus .  We bonded really well through frisbee , one of our common interests . Talking about the game , playing during the compre , at the lib lawns ... everything has been so much fun ......... This guy is always very calm , composed , senti too at times . Loves rom com , Tamil music ( which sucks btw ) and has a golden heart . It was really great to discover you as a friend ....... This guy has the unique ability of doing big things very silently and in a humble way . Loves his family a lot , seriously a very genuine person ........ His hindi accent is too funny . You just cannot stop laughing when he conversates in hindi ( specially the abuses ) . And its a tough task to explain him hindi jokes >.< and even when he gets them , he'll be like " Bitch please / Its so laammee " or will make a poker face . ....He has been always available to help . I guess I have made more use of his phone's cam than him clicking pics of Maths notes hours before the exam . Exiting days ........ We came close man this year . Lucky ppl get friends like you . Wish you an awesome future with lots of books , power electronics and a pretty girl :D . Cheers !!!   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>
<p>Ram - Had it not been for you my EEE experience would have been a lot worse.. Not that it is not bad right now :D but it would have been way much more ugly had it not been for you for providing me with some sort of relief.. I was always confident with the fact that 'agar kuch nahi hua to Ram to hai hi upar'.. Imagine the satisfaction that that thought would give to anyone.. :D Quite frankly speaking, I always took you for the Nerdy ones.. like super nerdy!! But the first shocker came when i learned that this guy is not an 8P!! He is among the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - He is a 7 pointer.. :D He is one of us.. And that is when i embraced u fully and whole heartedly as our own.. :P
The fun that i have had with the four of u.. (U, Gangal, Jassi, Sarang) is beyond words and you have been extra special coz we have had an awesome Kodai trip together!! And i still dont know why we can't finish a movie together without dozing off in the middle!!
I still remember that hand sensing Bot that u gave me to control and i was speechless.. Quite a sentimental moment for me that was.. :D U've been an instrumental part of our Frisbee gang.. and i guess frisbee has been the one thing that made us better and more awesome friends than usual.. From the first time i heard about u from one of my corridor mates (Ram upar rehta hai.. which i quite literally took the other way), to the small doubt solving sessions, to the Microelectronics and Communication systems, to yours and God's with super random hang outs in my room, to the Lunch and dinner, to the fully drenched Frisbee Games and in the end right through the stay at your home (an amazing experience, CB is a great city) I am nothing but glad to have such a simple and awesome friend.. Ur simplicity defines you man.. Stay this way.. :) Next sem is gonna be nothing but Legendary!! Oye Payncho.. Ab chal Khana Khane!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mudit-sinha">Mudit Sinha</a></p>

<p>I first met him at the end of 3-1 and this guy came as a total surprise to me. He is the most soft spoken person in campus. Very friendly and helpful, this guy has a heart of gold. He is good at acads and an excellent badminton and frisbee player. We had some memorable bike trips and outings, which also includes my accident  :( . Jassi is a lucky bitch to have a neighbour like u. Man i am really happy that we got to know each other(der se hi sahi). All the best for everything dude...cheers!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/deepak-kesri">Deepak Kesri</a></p>
<p>Anantaram Varatharajan.Hope i spelled u correct!! tamilian!..:P..he stays just 2 rooms next to 

me and it took me 5 sems to discover him.until then,i perceived him to be just another 8p,fodu 

in acads,duniyadaari lite.But he turns out to be a very pleasant surprise once you start 

knowing him.Got introduced to him informally through frisbee and the bond kept getting stronger 

with each game,with each outing,with each bike trip and with the innumerable 'reading-walks' we 

had this sem.He is unimaginably calm,is always composed,never do you see him under pressure.The 

hand sensing bot that he had made in his second year was nothing less than a magic show to a 

noob like me.u tell him at 2am "ram,yaar i don't have a battery charger and we have an outing 

tomorrow."he replies"what da jassi!...I'll make one charger for you by then"..n he was 

serious!!!..ok this was the techie him.On the flipside,he gets soo sooo lame at times that you 

reiterate to yourself.."yaar joke mein itna kuch toh tha hi nai ki ise kuch samajh nai 

aaya"..and then u need to go step by step to put it into his head.he has a very bad taste of 

PJs.though his attempts are appreciable.The joke with the mech guy and an animal still haunts 

me.He is genuinely passionate about riding bikes.A pan-india roadtrip is on the cards 

ram.someday it WILL happen for us!.His true love-pawar engineering.He is PATHETIC at 

betting!.but again,he is a man of his words.if he loses,he stays by his words...:P...He likes 

to dress.He is one big lover of pastries.amazing Gtalker.He has an EQ soo low that he had 

started weeping seeing his friend getting bashed up on his birthday!..:P..:D..His favorites 

include jodha akbar,tamil music,english romcoms,friends,and THE tarzan..;)..neway..I really 

admire ur mom's coolness!..Ram,you are a true gentleman.Simplicity is one innate quality in 

you.And yes,as mudit had said,it uniquely defines u..it really does!!...stay the same 

always...again...i quote Mudit...NEXT sem is gonna be legendary!..u,me,mudit,god,shady

<p>CHADDI!! as me and kheti bhaiya call him!  a very good frnd since the very 1st year which started on our very own BADMINTON court! we were the two idiots till lst year who used to play baddy day and night no matter exams or not or wat so ever. This guy is a perfect example and one of the most beautiful demonstration of how badminton is to be played and should be. Smooth and swift on court with god level reach, and nvr to forget those strong smashes.  _/\_ have always been the top admirer of your game on campus. Den at the beginning of the 3rd year came in Ultimate Frisbee. these common interest have always kept us really good frnz. He is a big time nerd scoring these awesm marks and god level projects in image processing this guy is  complete package. Havnt seen such a simple and down to earth guy ever in my life. Kudos to you for being the way you are. Hope we play baddy again together. ;) and if you remmber your epic dialogue "hume hindi aata hai" . :P 
stay in touch! best of luck for future.. cheers to Anantaram Varatharaj. ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranay-agrawal">Pranay Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Anantaram....well the first guy who i made friends with in college..and a good one at that...struck as me as a soft spoken person,humble and very senti guy...the  positives are plenty and although many have already written about i would like to reiterate... a great badminton player is what strikes me first as i am really fond of sports...well apart from that i could kick his ass in every other game...sadly for him..:D .Probably some of the few guys genuinely interested in his subjects...Well i have shared probably all of my best moments in college life with him..Right from Techfests at IITM&IIT KGP to what i could confidently say as the best trip of my life,,a bike ride among the might Himalayan ranges..That trip was something different..something which i could never express in words and to have shared that experience with you was just amazing....Hope we do that legendary trip to Ladakh in the near future...Stay in touch....atleast for the bet you have with me...Good luck for the future..hope this was senti enuf to make few tears roll down that cheek of yours :D:D;D..
