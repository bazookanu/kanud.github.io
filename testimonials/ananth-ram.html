<p>My Baabbyyy ! A never boring and wonderful company. A living legend of chemical on campus :D :P . The star of his branch where ppl die to see his rare, heroic entries. A true fan of DOTA ! DOTA == Ananth Ram & Ananth Ram == DOTA ! It would be totally meaningless if i dont mention his photo craze, may it be anywhere, just give a camera and a bakra photographer, he takes a maximum out of it  ! :D Lives life his own way and doesnt give a fuck about the system ! 

One of those kind of ppl with whom u dont  need any topic to talk to, he has looads and loads of MIND BLOWING theories which will just take u off to a new world :D ! Fun loving to the core, but anything karega for DOTA, wat ever he plans it will be such that he gets to play it to his fill. We 've always been together in epic moments, like Minapi, Daandeli, Doodsagar etc. U remember how ppl were pissed off and u were totally bindaas taking Pics while we thot we were lost in the forest of western ghats, on our minapi trip.  Now that defines craze, RESPECT ! The moments where we kept telling our past stories. I thot that wuld be between us, but u "*" made it public :P ! All ur Hyd babes stories, the Pulsar (which u say "assalu aada vanka choodaledu" ) pity that ride, maintaining a second setup vehicle for babes :P ! That unknown girl saying "Hi" issue in Panjim  :D ! Remember the day we spoilt ur bitch(la...) :P ! In sachin's room. three on one it was :D ! Disclamer:- To ppl reading this, this might seem odd, but it just isnt wat u r feeling yuck thinking wat it is ! Isnt it ISMAIL Bhai ? :D ! 
Ur Ismail Bhai pics and all the mutual dobbudu :D we always kept having. And abe howle, will meet  in hyd ! pakka !! :D :P be free when we come, remember us, dont get too busy with ur fans and pori's there ! :P 
I got no idea about where and how to end this testimonial, just be as "YO" as always, Mr. Pulsar. 
Aree Ismail Bhaik, mera jaan jigri, hamreku math bhool re miya. :D

"king" wat a nick , perfectly apt for him.I had awesome days with him in my last sem chemical labs, the amount of fun which we had was too much..I still remember the dailogues spoken by him regarding studies, girls and dota, those were omg dailogues \m/ The best thing about ananth is his helping nature /\ , he will do nything for his frns. He likes to go out wid frns, likes to take lot of pics.. The best best and excellent talent in ananth ram is his painting skills..I looked at some of his paintings, those were too amazing..An imba free hand painter with great innovation in his artistic skills..He works a lot, especially in labs he used to work a lot nd i used to tp a lot :P His has excellent skills in learning a subject with in few hours, very easily grasps lot of stuff..All the best my dear, ull reach great heights with ur skills and hatsoff for ur patience.Hope our frnship will continue with great fun nd there is still lot to go, ull be dere with me for next sem ,be in touch after college.
