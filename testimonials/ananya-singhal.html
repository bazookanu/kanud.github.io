<h1 class="page-title">Ananya Singhal</h1><p>You probably don't remember this but I remember the time when I first met you. It was a DoSM outing and you came up to me and said..."I'm Singhal"...I thought you said "I'm Single", I felt a bit weird that instead of introducing yourself by your name, you introduced yourself by your relationship status, but still being a firstie and all replied "Me too!"...LoL I know! Still, After this In the first few months we interacted solely on a department level, but over time we became friends. Whenever I had any problems, which I had a lot ( :P ), you guided me and helped me out to the best of your ability. For all that and more, I'm very grateful. Its been two years that I've known you now, granted that it isn't a very long time, but in these two years, you have been a fabulous senior (no ragging :P) and over and above that, a very good friend.  College is always the best time in anyone's life and I can attest to the fact that you have lived it king size. Now that its almost time for you to move on in the professional world and I would like to take this opportunity to wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors.  Just one request though "Apne bachhon ko college ke baad bhool mat jaana"!

Enjoy!!!

<p>Partner in a number of my labs, it was a pleasure attending all these labs with you. Mostly, because I didn't have to do a single thing in most of them because there was Singhal.  A very jugaadu person( I know this because of things we have done to not drop marks and get the output), hard-working, very detail oriented person and an indispensable person for most of the clubs and departments he has worked for, labs wouldn't have been the same but for you. Thanks. Have a great life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>One of the very few seniors I knew from my first year. It's always a great time to sit with you and have a chat. Learned a couple of things from you. Thanks a lot. And have a good time like you always do.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-pant">Aniket Pant</a></p>
<p>Entertaining, diligent and intelligent, Ananya reminds of the character one could find in a book or a movie who has his people in every realm and could tell you what's happening or can get things done in moments... a quality of highly successful people indeed. A very outgoing person, his anecdotes about campus activities and life are always the center of attention. If you can get bored with this guy around, you indeed have a screwed up sense of humor. Very interested in campus activities, Ananya has given BITS everything it could have ever asked for, be it DoSM, Quark or CSA elections, he just didn't seem to have any time to sit. An avid reader, his take on life, morals and his amazing ability to draw your attention with his playful use of words have often left me spell bound. Wishing you all the very best in each of your endeavor. Hoping our paths cross many times in the future!!!! cheers to you and life bro!!!!!!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>

<p>Ananya, a guy who possesses every weapon under his arm. And Siddharth has mentioned him perfectly - "He has his people everywhere" and can get you whatever, whenever, and wherever you want. He is one of the very few people on campus whom I admire more than anybody else. He is an outgoing guy with a street smart intelligence, which I learned working alongside him for Quark for 3 years. Not to mention he is very mature, practical in approach, a leader and his convincing nature is beyond any justification. He is in true ways, a good friend who is ready to lend you hand anytime. I wish him all the very best and hope he will achieve something great in future :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>

<p>Ananya …an extremely chilled out, friendly, jovial and fun-loving person!! A very good lab partner…it was because of him that I finished all my work pieces on time. Every time I would ruin the experiment, he will somehow find a solution. He has a total bindaas attitude…stay the same...i wish you all the happiness and success in life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akansha-suneria">Akansha Suneria</a></p>
<p>Singhal is like the gossip magazine of the campus. Somehow, he knows everything that's going on. Great networker, very resourceful, and a totally people-centric guy. He has the ability to make anyone comfortable around him. It's these qualities that'll make you very successful indeed. I remember the first time we met was when I had some phone recharging issue and you instantly came n helped me out. Very outgoing and easygoing person. I always have fun when you're around. I can talk about pretty much anything, and you'll always be interested. Very jugadu person, last moment pe bhi you can pull something off. Won't forget the fun we've had together on so many trips. Keep in touch always. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Singhal .....met him right in my first sem ...DOFAM stall at the gate ...remember...:P!!!!Then the guy realized that marketing and spons was the thing for him  and ever since then he has been a permanent fixture around food stalls in every fest .........extremely hard working .......and a nice person to hangout with ........though we have had our fair share of clashing interests ...but even then we have managed to stay on good terms with each other ...and this i think will come in handy when we move to 4-1...........though we meet very rarely but whenever we meet we can go on talking and talking ........!!!!All said .....I wish you all the luck for your future and have a happy life ....!!Stay in touch ......:)!!1

<p>Singhal, met him in my first sem, Bio class :D and then our friendship grew!! He is always ready to help others, extremely hard working and one of the best friends you can ever have! Has been an integral part of the marketing team, his work definitely is a benchmark for all the ones succeeding him. Always involved in the campus stuff, you can find him in boghmalo most of the times :P Thanks for helping me out whenever iam in a need!! Stay in touch!

I remember the first time I met you...at Mongi, over coffee, for our first official "mentor-mentee" meeting....I'll admit I had my doubts about you in the beginning, but gradually, with time, you turned out to be a great mentor...may be not a perfectionist, but a hardworking, considerate mentor all the same...and you always led by example, which for me, was even better...some people may call you immature, but I think you're inherently carefree, a child at heart, which inspite of being suppressed,  pops up every now and then....the best thing about you is that you are a dreamer, driven by hope and aspirations and though these dreams might not always materialize, your belief in them is infectious...and so is your rather goofy smile (which, drunk or not, seems to be constantly plastered to your face)...so even though people may misjudge you at times, prove it to them that you are a good man at heart...which I'm confident you are...so keep smiling and don't ever give up on your zest for life !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rucha-karkhanis">Rucha Karkhanis</a></p>
