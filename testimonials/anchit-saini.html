<h1 class="page-title">Anchit Saini</h1><p>Hmm Anchit ..!!  A pure punjabi boy by his actions , style , selection of songs  etc .  I didnt know him for the first few weeks until the first T1 papers were distributed . We sat on the last bench waiting for the  talks of the over expressive prof ( with extremely irritating facial expressions) in thermodynamics class . We ended up getting the same marks which was heavily  "av- "  . HAHA and it is well known that frnz in bad times are the greatest ones :P . Hence started our unique journey . In the first sem , had the same unknown motive of killing our time irrespective of wat the time is ..!! His room always kept open and acted as a common room for everyone passing by .. Nevertheless , a great person with deep thoughts . . A person who always stands by what he says and does wat he wants . A true independent individual who wants to live life as happily as possible .  He is also a mysterious one wen it comes to studies ... never attends classes , still manages to score well and gives the credit to his magical calci to getting him the right calculations done ..  :P . A total freak with frnz who is sure to help you in your bad times .. we have seen a lot of things in these three years we spent together  which will be in my heart forevr . Guys , this individual is to lookout for in the near future to come . I wish  all your dreams come true and be the frnd you are for the rest of u r life   :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>

<p>Well, to start with the first time I met you was in 1-2 and my first impression about you was that you are a very tough guy, fun-loving, "nothing can affect him" and a great guy to hang out with. Then began a time filled with fun outings, crazy incidents, stupid fights, etc etc. With each and every passing day, I got to know you more and more. Behind that rough and tough look resides a person who has such a pure heart and soul. He is such a caring person and can never see anyone sad and makes an effort to console you and support you whenever you need. He teases me a lot and thinks m dumb, but i am not n u know that :P if you dont then u better do ;) but all his teasing and pulling my leg is something m going to miss the most :) He is an independent person and does whatever he thinks is right without thinking about anything else and that is what i truly admire in him and wish to learn from him. He has been a great support and an awesome frnd for me in good times as well as bad. He is one person I can tell anything and yes, he listens to all my crap without complaining and i really appreciate that. N kabhi toh meri bi chalne  dia karr :P but anywys, its always fun fighting with you on stupid things like "main gadhi nai hun, insaan hun" haha :D He always tries to keep  everyone around happy and whenever you are sad, you are ensured to feel lightened after talking to him. I wish all the happiness to you and you are truly an amazing person. I am going to miss you soo much, you have no idea !! Always remain the same and may you get whatever you desire. Keep in touch always. :):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Anchit Bhaiyya..!!!! I have known him for a year now, through RC of course. Our paths never crossed, we never worked together or never did hang out much together, but I do know him enough to believe that we are going to be more than just friends, and for a long, long time. A sweet, caring and extremely helpful person, I like him a lot and wished I had got more opportunities to spend time with him.
Anchit bhaiyya, come back from your PS and I can't wait to go to Bogmalo with you again, to share a cigar, or try a new drink.
Gonna miss you next sem though. But we'll keep in touch. Lots of love to you, bhaiyya, best of luck for your PS and future, its definitely gonna be better than Angul. :-) :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>
<p>Anchit saini.... when u hear the name... all that comes to ur heart is respect and peetne ki icha.... jo mujhe nahi lagta meri puri honi hai.. :P i 1st remmeber we met in yuvraj's room where we started talking and acquinted with each other... and as we were neighbors..i knew i will see a lot more of him too.... he remains silent most of the time... but it doesnt mean he is boring or doesnt express himself.... ones close to him know what goes through his freaky head and play their cards accordingly... punjab da sheer.... isse punga leke har bar pita hi hun... but bahut maza aaya... punga lene me... hamesha subah isse disturb karta tha uthane ke waqt..and he always used to get angry on me... had a blast then.... we spent quite a lot of time sitting and marroying gappein.. and knowing each odr well...we did have our quarrels and we did get into physical brawls...too... (as stated above...i lost every1 of them.. :'( :P :D ) but i loved it...  he's an emotional fool in a sense...bt he covers it will his silent type personality at times... knows when to speak what n has a very sharp sense of observation.... kuch galat bola...to taunt padna hi hai... :P that's irritating at times... but i also think that's what's gonna take him ahead in life....
he's  been a friend who i could always rely upon and never did he disappoint me in anythin i asked for.... i have tried doing the same for him..and he was among the only few in this campus from whom i wanted to be recognised as a friend...and i did and i consider it as a moment of pride.. :) 
i will always remember the time when we used o have serious talks about me and how u used to advise me in my tough times...i also wont forget the timewhen u used to irritate me out of my wits...but that's alryt...coz i used to do pretty much the same.. :)
pure punjabi at heart and cares about no1.... and lives his life as he wishes to... his room used to be the most liveliest place on this campus according to me...as i guess...not more dan 10-12 ppl can enter in this small room of urs...and aesa iske room me hua hoga...we used to stay up all nyt and have fun.... even playing monopoly in the 1st year has some great memories... like one tym when takeshwar sir came and asked agar hum jua khel rahe the and all.. and we also invited him to do the same.. :P u me and yuvraj used to discuss things in chandigarh and always felt at home along with u all.... had a blast all this time...except for the time i missed out because i wasnt a part... 
i hope that you are succesful in whichever field u go for...and only good wishes and love as a friend is what comes for u when i think of u buddy.... FIGHT HEAD ON...AND WIN HEAD ON.... AND ALWAYS REMEMBER... SEE YOUR BACK..COZ I WILL ALWAYS BE THERE... :D :) hope we remain friends forever and let the good times rooollllll.... will miss u man... :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankit-jain">Ankit Jain</a></p>
