<h1 class="page-title">Aniket Panse</h1><p>You hear this great rumbling high-bass earth shaking laughter--you know Aniket is nearby!! (Though it can even be heard at great distances)..Personality wise, I have tons of respect for this guy. He will only do what he believes! Baaki sagle gele tel laavat. His creativity never ceases to astound me! :@ In 1-1 Physics and Biology, Aniket was a constant source of entertainment and round the clock laughter (add to this the Aniket-Sumant-Thermodynamic wars, and you have a r.o.f.l. stomach ache).--I have never seen a programmer (pardon the layman word) like him. His laptop looks like some MI6 machine straight from the movies! Add to this his blow-your-head-off Physics skills and you get a really unique person! ---<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>

<p>No one can defeat him in a debate,no one can be as unpredictable as him,no one can solve physics problems as elegantly as him and no one loves ubuntu more than him.It is really hard not to notice Ani with his unique voice and tall frame.A wonderful person and a computer genius and an irodov master he has a simple philosophy - "Dude,dont mess with me" . With his love of coding and vast amount of knowledge Mr.Panse surely going to rock in the future in whatever he does.ATB!

<p>The only person probably existing on earth does not call me "Datye"... :P ...The man with the unending laughter... When in mess his laughter makes all the 400 people turn their eyes towards him... His favorite words being "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" :P ... A huge Linux fan or a developer  I must say... Probably the one who spread awareness about linux in the group... An efficient and proficient python programmer... Loves to program like anything... This guy is a true computer genius... Give him his laptop and a place to charge it and this guy will survive even the most extreme conditions of life if at all there is one. Along with food clothing and shelter, laptop is his basic necessity.... Always is playing around with his PC doing something or the other... .. Also he is a real physics GOD. (Has a vast knowledge about physics).. Probably the only one to be called as 'Irodov' after Irodov himself... May be one of the guys who is taller than me... My PS buddy at Thermax... I will never forget those PS days... Those awesome days where we were allotted the first "cabin" of our lives... :P... What not have we done in that very small cabin !!! .. Right from watching friends, movies, playing minesweeper,armageddon, etc,  torturing rachit, the epic TEA that Thermax used to provide thrice a day... :)... Eating chips that we used to stealthily sneak out of the office to get chips from the hot chips shop outside thermax... Those awesome days where we had awesome "Thermax food" together.... (Even though you used to have Egg Schezwan Rice almost all the time :P)... those awesome moments we had when we worked over the ERP thing frankly speaking we did nothing related to ERP but just read manuals and stuff... which was of no use :P....  Ohh.. and how can I forget the day when you forgot your laptop in the auto rickshaw... :D.. Aniket is one of those people who is fun to hang around... Thanks dude for giving me those awesome memories at PS which I would cherish for my life time... :) I am glad to have friend like you :) All the best and I know you will make wonders happen in the field of computers... :) Finally the last words for now...  ("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA");P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>

<p>AAAAAA!!!!! Thats how we know him here... Aniket is the kind of person who will act without giving a shit about what others think , and that is what makes him so fun to hang out with. His laughter has already been made famous by every one of his testimonial!! HE is an exceptional coder and can code with equal fluency in any language be it C,Java,Python . He was the only one who knew that there something existed called 'ubuntu' when we joined BITS. His vivid ( mostly toilet humor ) imagination has been a great source of entertainment since day 1. He is also a part of 'Exodus' \m/ and MVP of the team (>.<) . Aniket is a person with brains and coding skills of a geek and an attitude of a dude. Many people also recognize him by the name 'irodov' owing to his exceptional understanding of physics. Whenever I am bored, he will always be there to relieve my boredom a game of chess :) (and lose :D) . WIth his exceptional grasp of computer science he will no doubt be some extremely competent and successful kernel developer or something of that sort in the future. Kudos to you man!!! Don't change that happy-go-lucky attitude of yours EVER!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>
<p>P.S.- Aniket has the shrillest, loudest, and most piercing whistle :D. I am second to him. Whistling in resonance with each other at the shrillest possible pitch in the audi has always been a guaranteed head turner!! :$<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Aniket the person with wackiest,creative and most vivid imagination!!Especially with things that you don't need to imagine about.A true intellectual when it comes to coding and physics.An open-source person,he is extremely passionate about computers and he can survive without anything but laptop.Always fun to hang with him there's never a dull moment with him and his huge grin and his wacky sense of humour trickles your funny bone a lot.All the best for your future endeavors and keep in touch!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-thakare">Nakul Thakare</a></p>
<p>Ae Bhunkya...that was his characteristic phrase in 1-1. But that was before I heard him laugh,I mean LAUGH. The loudest, most distinguished and the funniest laugh ever! You will laugh at even a sucky joke when you hear him.(aaaaaaaa) Aniket is the god of winning arguments, his way. He is a pro CS player and a pro chess player. But everything comes second to his genius programming skills. He is a linux god, can do anything and everything. 2010 batch,beware. The is not a dull moment when you are around, Aniket.(I'm sure Raman and Pagya will agree). I will always remember the daily TT showdown we used to have in 1st and 2nd year. Best of luck, may the Korn be with you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>Aniket, I had no idea when we first met in K.G that 12 years later we would end up in the same corridor in BITS, next to each other. The one thing I can say about Aniket is that he'll always come through for you. He doesn't give a damn about what anyone else thinks. A chilled out person to hang out with and I'm sure its solely because of his good clean humour. ;)  this guy is a computer genius (or geek?) with amazing coding skills. Give him an Ubuntu terminal and he's happy. You can almost always find him coding away while listening to Korn (dude, really?) and Eluveitie :D. Always gets irritated when I compare Windows and Linux or Android and Apple! Reading the above testimonials, you must have gathered that he's got a rather noticeable laugh :D (dunno how I didn't notice earlier!) and we almost always have a gag at the mess table. Aniket is also part of the legendary Exodus and he's the lone rider of the team. He's an exceptional d-eagler and always bores everyone by blabbering away into the mic ;) He's ever ready for a round of chess or tt. This guy has been a solid friend for almost my entire life and I know he'll remain so. All the best for your future and I know you're going to go places! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ameya-karambelkar">Ameya Karambelkar</a></p>
