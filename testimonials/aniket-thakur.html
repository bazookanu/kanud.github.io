<p>One of the most humble person I have ever met.A god cs player.Hats off to his persistence and patience.He is god both in cs and CS(Computers)[no kidding], I would say one of the best web designers. It really is astonishing how he manages to be good at studies,cs,computers,web designing and many more stuff at a time. A true friend and one I would like to be friends with all my life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sasanka-avadhanula">sasanka avadhanula</a></p>
<p>You say Aniket Thankur, and the first thing that comes to my mind is that bursting laughter. Truly an awesome guy, truly charismatic and one who carries himself well with people. Cool dude of CS and DC, most people will remember this guy as black-pearl. A great friend and a nice guy to be with, not to mention his helpfulness and caring character. Academically amazing and an expert coder, this guy enjoys the company of people as much as they do. Thanks for being with me during this journey of life, I shall remember you forever... Wish you all success and happiness in your future endeavours.. Farewell and do keep in touch!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>OMG! the famed bp _/\_ one hell of a coder...an enthusiastic learner,very warm,a true friend,a Counter Strike freak,very bindass,the "dood" of IS.First time i saw you was in the second week of august 2009 just ouside the hostel you were coming from the mess listening to some weird songs on your cell phone on loudspeaker (as usual!)(he thinks using headphones can make a person deaf)and i thought what an idiot!...little did i know that the same guy would turn out to be one of my most influential friends in college,slowly we started interacting(remember going to cc to practice EG??) and i came to know about the real Aniket Thakur...since then there has been no looking back and i guess our friendship has only grown over the years!.Some people  might not know this but this guy ventured out to a beach only in his third year,and part of the credit goes to me...I love the way he laughs though.....learnt a lot from him....my most cherished memories will be the nights that i spent with him and the others coding...what fun times they were.....thanks aniket for making my three years rocking!!always proud to be your friend!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-ramanan">Paritosh Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Aniket Thakur aka Beeeepeeeeeee ………. He is a pro in both Counter Strike and Computer Science. He gives equal dedication to both of them. When he is playing CS, no one dares to disturb/ping him. When he is coding, he is completely focussed. He loves Linux and always finds Linux equivalents of Windows software/tools. He really has a lot of knowledge about various languages. He is one of those guys who starts the syllabus just one night before the exam, manages to finish it and aces the exam too. He is very friendly, calm and always ready to help you in need. This is our last sem together and I wish you all the best for your future. Go rock the placements ………. But I must say I love the way you fight with Rahul and Paritosh :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Aniket  is an example to many with his ability to maintain his studies with his passion for gaming and other activities . He always delivers more than he promises and is never late , be it his study assignments or other activities. He is not only one of the best players of Counter strike but also a brilliant student.  It's a pleasure being with him and I wish him all the best for his future. Hope you join Microsoft or Google man...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>Aniket ka ‘Tonda’ aka Black Pearl is one the best CS players I know of… And though he hardly hit anyone, his presence in the corridor maintained the balance between insanity and wisdom. A great little combo of wit, intelligence, laziness and humor :D
On a more serious note, Tonda always helped out whenever I needed him. A true blue gentleman and damn good friend, his dimples eased out the most difficult of problems…  He never bragged about his achievements, be it academics or headshots or matters of the heart!
Sure hope to find you again sometime again in life buddy!

<p>When things get negative in campus, Aniket's infectious laughter truly is the best medicine. I've been lucky enough to know Aniket aka bp for over a year now and his kind, helpful and down to earth nature are just some of his great qualities.  He's very sincere,hardworking, a pro gamer and coder.   Though I missed his first visit to the beach  , we've been on other trips and have had some good times. There's also a childlike quality about him (his love for animation for eg.) which is very refreshing.  I hope you stay the same and that we can meet in the future as well-all the best ! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayush-sanyal">Ayush Sanyal</a></p>
<p>A full screen flood of 'join 10.3.10.46 for cs 5v5' on DC mainchat is what this guy is famous for. A big CS addict, though I've never played, I can easily say that he's one hell of a player from his dedication towards the game. A friendly, fun loving person, his way of commenting at things can be truly hilarious. This guy can balance acads and gaming very well, no matter what. I still remember those nightouts during exams when he's off at 4am for a CS match when there's an exam at 8.30 _/\_. Will miss all those mini IS meetings at Nescafe and Monginis with him and the rest of the gang... something I consider unique to our awesome IS batch \m/. Also the endless nights spent coding (er.. more of nonsense and timepass than coding it was :P :D ) will be remembered for a long time... Well, keep in touch, and wishing you success in your future endeavours and all the best for an awesome career ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pavan-agnihotri">Pavan Agnihotri</a></p>

<p>Aniket- one word describes him the best and that is "Phodu". He is an Intelligent & hardworking person with an ever smiling face. His dedication for two things is truly commendable - first is Coding in which he excels way beyond the limits and second is Gaming where he is the one and only "Black_Pearl" the pro CS player. All the fun time we had during labs, snax chats and nescafe are some memories i will always cherish.I'm sure you will achieve great heights in your life. All the very best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>

<p>He is a very friendly,humble and well mannered guy . He is always in a fun filled mood and he would be the last person I know to ever get angry . He is an exceptional coder and and a very good CS player ( esp when he camps :P :P ) . We had some fun times together when we played all those clan matches with ACE tag :D . All those "after the match" discussions , wrongs and pointing out mistakes were fun .  I cant forget the  fights we had over CS :D esp bout ur magging :P . I am pretty sure we will meet on an online CS server sometime in the future :D .Thanks for everything man and all the very best for your future which I know is definitely very bright. :) :) :) . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vivek-g-kamath">Vivek G Kamath</a></p>

<p>Hardworking, ambitious and focus, he is good at multi tasking and maintains a perfect balance between academics and other stuff. He is a very composed guy. His godzilla laugh is very popular among friends. The time we spent in mess and going for a walk are all cherish-able moments. He is a phodu in academics esp mathematics. He is a pro CS player. I wont forget the expressions on your face and excitement when you first went to the beach. He is hard working and is a great person at heart. With your hard work and honesty you will surely attain success.. Wish you all the best for your future.!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>Hmm .. Aniket ..!!  A hostel lover ...  Kabhi bahar hi ni nikalta ..!!  I stiil remember people asking him in second year ...  that he was in our hostel and IS students  of the same hostel 
being equally amazed ...!! Very sincere to the core .. tunda .. kabhi kabhi to pata bhi ni chalta tujhe ki teri lag rahi hai  ... mostly by pandu and vice versa..!!  :P .A constant companion in train journeys .. a man of high principles .. never gets late to pay his debts if ever he gets into it .. *claps* ..!! Hard working .. pro in java , database , web designing and wat not ... has built himself into an asset worth grabbing for companies .. which will be clear next sem when he kills the placement sessions ...  I hope u bring a lot of smile on  your papa's face who I can clearly see believing a lot on u and u r abilities ...  and finally bhulne ki to baat hi ni hai .. 15 min dur hai ghar .. kabhi bhi mil lenge ..!!  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
<p>BP: The CS legend :P One of the best CS players in Campus, Aniket is an example on how to balance your acads with gaming while being awesome at both. Aniket is also an excellent coder. The countless hours spent with him, Pavan and Pandu, coding the night away were truly remarkable, and few of the most memorable moments in college. Like his habit in CS, he often headshots his acads easily. A true phodu in every sense :P Though I wish he had accompanied us to more beach trips. 
Aniket, it was a pleasure playing CS with you. May you keep giving headshots in the future. Will really miss you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>Aniket Thakur aka tonda aka black pearl. The guy who is always running after Asati to kick his ass for the 'saste' jokes and the things he does which shouldnt be mentioned here :P :D Amazing gamer, his love for CS and his proness at the game only grew with time. You have great coding skills (loved your text editor/message encrypting software). Very talented and balances academics with his gaming very easily. A power packed combo of wit, humour and laziness :D :D On a more serious note, Tonda always extended his helping hand whenever I needed him. Be it completing an assignment or solving doubts of the exam at 3 AM we had the next morning. Extremely humble, he never bragged about his achievements. May you achieve everything you have set your eyes on and more. Wish you a great future ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-tak">Varun Tak</a></p>
