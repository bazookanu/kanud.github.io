<p>You are so mature and in the same way you are so childish at times. I like you the most when you are childish and that is when we fight over temple run and when we mesmerize the taste of the food. :D One best thing you have is your attitude towards things and people which gave me the confidence that you can survive in any crisis. I wish all the best for your future and hope our dream comes true one day of owning a huge company in which I am also a part. Will never forget you as you are a proper mentor to me and hope you will be beside me in dire situations. :P.........    Finally good luck roman.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>

<p>Reddy, words don't have the ability to completely describe this man. All the time i have spent with this man has been invariably cheerful. All the small talk while walking to the water cooler, the evening cricket and how he would stand up against the @#$%^ we knw as "Tripathy". A true leader, amazing friend and people person. Its really sad we won't have a common semester again but I do wish to keep in touch with you. We all in AH3 love you and wish you great success in ur life. 
P.S. : Always wear that smile, suits you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>

<p>One of my best buddies. It goes down to early days of my 1-1, when we used to play volley ball, we got our intro. It achieved one more step with our T1 results :D. Somehow, he managed to leave me alone with those results and chose his way of getting better results later on :P. I had little bit of problem  in those days with his accent-though its Telugu :P. Later, i came to know that its contagious. Moving on, we had so many tests that we screwed up together. A good friend, down to earth attitude though he is one of the most influential persons in campus. He cares for everyone. One of the lazy guys i have known till now. He is good at getting things done(let it be for hostel/campus/whatever). And also good at managing things. I still remember the first time that i played CS,NFS in his comp(its his brother's comp,actually :P). And its been my saviour for the last few months. Its apt that we call him "The Godfather" of campus. Its been three years together and it has been a wonderful time with you-let it be preparation for exams, playing volley ball, elections in which you won as gen-sec, our trips.  I wish you all the best for your future and i have confidence that you will fulfill your dreams :). And yes, lets rock 4-2.FTW.
