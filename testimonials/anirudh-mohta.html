<h1 class="page-title">Anirudh Mohta</h1><p>Anirudh and I were not acquainted until 1-2, strange, given that we are from the same city. He is a fabulous friend and a very simple, down-to-earth guy. His jokes made me laugh soo many times that I lost count and his hard work is unmatched. He is truly a fantastic guy to know. Keep in touch and stay the same way.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>Anirudh-'Live and let live' is his mantra for life. Very focused, dedicated, hardworking,with a BIG heart, amazing sense of humor, simple, down to earth and a true friend describe him. But for me, he is not only a friend who cracks jokes with you but a brother, who corrects me (fourteen), guides me whenever I am wrong. His out of the box jokes, witty answers can leave anyone perplexed. Lucky to have him as my friend and I wish u all success in life!! :) :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>The first thing wat comes to my mind of thinking of anirudh is Respect (_/\_)......yes man u deserve this....u have earned this over the years.....my padosi(although he stays most of the time in AH3) and my bench mate in most of the IS classes is a truly hardworking and intelligent guy......it wont be wrong to call him Mr. Perfectionist.......never gets pissed off at nything........best person to have in a group assignment (thanks man fr CN and SE assignment without u it wud have been impossible to do that). A grt person at heart and is ever helping......n i m sure his dedication will help him reach heights...i wish all your wishes come true in years to come......will surely miss a frnd like u...thanks for being there......God bless u !!!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kapil-aggarwal">Kapil Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>After all the time we have spent in college, if i actually got down to write a detailed testimonial for mohta, it would never end. I have known him since fiitjee days, and saw him develop in college as a more complete person. Talking of fiitjee, we still share jokes like how we imbibed "tips" from partho and how harsh spent time with his ladylove(ananya). We share the knack to make a joke out of everything and of course, each other. Life in college would be very incomplete without him around. The best moments I had with him is when I beat him black and blue in FIFA (:P), and he "couldn't do jack". 
To end it all I must say you are a gem of a person. I'm sure you will have a hot wife. Atleast I hope you do! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sourav-banerjee">Sourav Banerjee</a></p>
