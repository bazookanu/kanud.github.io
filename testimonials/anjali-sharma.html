<h1 class="page-title">Anjali Sharma</h1><p>Well, our friendship started in a very weird manner:P weird in the sense, that initially, we din like each other (i know, shocking :P) But thats true. I thought she din like me, she thought i din like her and so we ended up not liking each other :P But the first time we really got to know each other was during our 1st quark and music nite, to be precise. That was the first time, we actually opened ourselves to each other. N then i got to know how wrong i was and i must tell you, 1st impression shouldnt be the last impression because u might end up ignoring a person who actualy turns out to be your best frnd. Happend with me :P I cant think of one day on this campus without you!! We have been together in good times as well as bad times. I have infinite memories with you and i cant even recollect all of them. You made each and every moment on this campus special for me. Yes, you are like my small, bigdi sister :P:) i do get irritated by you a lot of times because of your low level jokes and stupid logics :P but i also loveee you for that :):* All the outings whether to bogmalo, vasco, habibs( hair-cutting buddy ;)) and manyyyy moreee turned out to be just awesome with people like you around :) You have become such a big part of my life like a family, that i cant imagine my life without you. You have been a great support for me and always encouraging, helping in every possible way and i truly appreciate you for that. You are a great human being, a bit crazy :P but eventualy, ppl get used to that ;) I have no words to express how much i am going to miss you. I wish we could be together our whole life but we all know, that is not possible :( but that wont change anything. Chahe tu dunia ke kisi kone me chhup jae, mujhse itni asaani se picha ni chhutegaa ;):D Your place in my life will be always reserved and no one can ever take that :) Jab bi hiccups aaye tujhe, then you should know that its me, missing you :) I wish from the core of my heart that all the happiness is yours and may you get in life whatever you wish for. N always keep smiling and remain happy because your happiness is directly proportional to mine :):* All the very best in life and may you achieve the greatest heights!! N I am always there for you no matter what. Love you a lotttttttttttttt!!! :):):*<3 <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>
<p>Great surprise comes in small packages, a line well suited for such a dynamic personality. You might claim to be strong but I know 'tu kitni fatto hai'...I remember in our 1st sem you came back from bog coz it was dark ( o.O ), you get scared even if some1 mocks a lizard behind your back ( i loved doing dat n will keep on doing that as long as its fun).. I guess, your fav job is to declare each one of us kids, maybe its a measure to seek company for yourself... Jokes apart, It's always fun to be around you n crack those lame jokes. I've always considered you as a small lil kid and treated you in the similar way. Deep inside you're an awesome person with wonderful helping attitude.. You're the only female friend of mine with whom i've been taking since 1st year n i'll keep on doing in future. Thanks for being there for me and giving advice about almost everything and anything. I remember asking you how to dress up for a date. I'll definitely miss all the moments I've collected in these 3 years.
Finally, I wish you best of luck in all you future endeavors.. Have a great life dear !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Anjali Sharma .......Enigmatic with a capital E is how I am compelled to describe her .......:P!!!We bonded over rounds of long chat in our first year summer vacations (we had nobody else to talk to ......:P) and then went onto become friends and then a more sacred relation followed .......!!!I agree with Mohit about you being a darpok ....very easy to scare you ......!!!!She is the first person who made me realize that blood is not always thicker than water and she is the person who made each of my Rakhsa Bandhan's a memorable one .....:)!!!Thanks for that ...!!!Now onto the truth ....an absolute kid at heart who loves to trouble people but ends up herself getting troubled in the end ...........has recently developed a taste for cracking extremely "lethal " jokes which are .......umm irritating to say the least ...:P!!!!!Can do well in academics when she wants to as she is blessed with a sharp mind which she claims is "inherited" ......:P!!!!Above average in "pencil sketches" though I am in possession of an extremely "beautiful" sketch of yours ...;D;P!!!!!All the times spent with you will remain in my memory as something I will turn to when I am sad in the times to come .....:)!!!And all the  
"hiccups" notwithstanding  you will always occupy a very special place in my heart and in my college memories .........!!!!We might not meet again in life ...but I wish you perennial happiness and everlasting success in life .....!!!!All the best and always keep smiling .....:)!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-choudhury">Rahul Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Anjali ... sometimes i call her "chotu"..dont mind :) ... 
I first met her in semester 1. Her ATTITUDE was very offending. :P (some misunderstanding perhaps ).. We became good friends in the second semester and it was then when i found out how simple and down to earth person she is.. ( although isko udne ka boht shauk hai :P) ...she's very fond of moon i must say :P . We've attended very few classes together, Physics 2 was one of them (and yeah , i never had a crush on that TA :P)
You can scare this one very easily ( outer circle remember :P ) .. Very good at heart, kiddish sometimes yet responsible, very cute,  a typical " jatni ", actually she knows harayanvi quite well (right chori? :P).  We've had plenty of trips together ..bogmalo, utorda, palolem was the best .. You can talk to her about anything though every second reply of her will be  "shut up" or "go to hell "  or "main ni " :P ... i liked the last one actually.
 Old times will be missed.. I wish you all the very best for your life ahead...stay happy .. and dare not forget me :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-rastogi">ADITYA RASTOGI</a></p>
<p>Anjali aka anji..single girl in my PS1(my bad luck :-/)..who tolerated my all type of bakwas and now here also tolerating :P..first time when i saw her in college i thought that she is aunty(boring) type(its true...i srsly thought :P)...but when i talked to her(i think on facebook)..i realised that she is no where close to 'aunty type'...during PS we became gud frnds...she is a fun loving,sweet,intersting girl and laughs so much..she always speaks some irritating words like PERRRFFEEEECCT,ACHAAA!!!  etc etc..(still i like those words) she is really NOT a hard working girl(only i did project work)..u and me discovered a AIR FURNACE luv story(2nd project ;))...she told me so many things about girls like they do so much bitching :D...anji and ishita have so much love(as described in ishita's testimonial...i dunno what kind of luv :P)...jokes apart...she is a wonderful,multi-talented person and u will definitely enjoy her company...all the best for ur future FROM Bawloooooo  :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sandeep-sharma">Sandeep Sharma</a></p>
<p>Anjali.... the first gal i met in campus... it dint take any time for her getting transformed from an acquaintance to a very close and dear friend. Even when we dint use to hang out together i used to chat a lot wid u and do a lot of gossip.. :P ( that was really strange.. :D) but now after a span of three long years filled with our chuckles, laughters  (generally annoying and embarrassing to those who accompany us :O :P), senseless fights n arguments ( which are almost negligible ?), sessions of serious discussion, sharing our happiness and sorrows and many other never ending things and events in life has made u a part and parcel of my life..you are the one who always compliments my jokes and understands them as soon as i crack them.. ; ) u r a true admirer of logic :D.. “laali” is what i luv to tease you wid.. and mind u, the expression on ur face is worth watching mann... :).. i just luv it.. ;)  :D . Our so many awesome outings with ishita, bharti, neha and nikhita are just unforgettable. You are the one who started taking me to bogmalo after pleading so much and have now made me habitual of it.. ( infact i love bogmalo now... n some credit goes to u for dat ;).. you have become my soulmate. I cant even imagine my college life without you.. u hav always been a pillar of support for me no matter however silly or serious be the reason of my concern or tension. And yes how can i miss our birthday excitement that we always share before and during T1.. :P our plans of bringing cakes for each other and wat not.. :) . You have been such a sweet and caring friend and i feel really lucky to hav u by my side. The only problem  is dat tujhse har bat ro roke, pair pakad pakad k nikalwani padti h.. :-// but other dan dat u r my sweet little cute, moti ( ball banke baithi rehti h :D) ANGEL.. :D.. you are so very brainy and sharp  i must tell u dear.. n m sure wen ur intelligence is amalgamated with sincere efforts  you would do wonders ( the way u hav worked for any college activity, be it big or small,  is an evidence for the same :) )... and i hope dat you get the best of everything in future.. :) .. ur simplicity and straight forward nature is what i love the most.. ( jo  bhi h muh pe suna dena hota h..  :D) u r a complete drama queen (mukhota :D as said my neha.. :P ) u have set a mark my doing certain things which i’ll remember forever in my life like “thenk you” , “water bowl...” in HQ .. :P and many many more..  which leave me laughing  endlessly... :P.. Going throught the memory lane, remembering all those moments we shared together and with our group makes me feel really sad that we are parting our ways now..  a friend like u , “ANJI”  will always be missed.. luv u yaar... :’) will cherish all the lovely and  priceless memories shared with you.. i know tujhe nhi pta tha ki u value so much n k tera itna bhaav h.. but jaate jate maine socha bta dun.. :P :) :-*****  will miss u lot... and i expect that we’ll always keep on meeting in future.. :) you rock anji baby... :D :P :-****<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/divya-nayak">Divya Nayak</a></p>
<p>Anjalii!! Ha ha i remember the first time I met you.. we were all outside ch5 and bharti and the others were trying to get a senior to call her friends from ch4 and rag you!!! :P
ever since then it was great fun to have you around. i remember your birthday in 1st year which turned into an early holi for everyone! :P and those gossip sessions we used to have at night-you, ishita and i- we would talk about anyone and anything :P and all the times we hung out during spree in first year and second year- i would have died of boredom if it hadn't been for you and your silly yet funny jokes :P fun apart, you really work hard for the things you really want.. your sincerity is applaudable.. and yet you are one of the simplest people I have ever met.. you truly are the "Miss fantastic" of the campus =)
good luck for the future Anji.. I am sure you'll go places! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreya-kedia">Shreya Kedia</a></p>

<p>Anjali..Most aptly "Miss Fantastic" ... has never spared a moment without amusing me. I shall always remember the \m/ time I had with you in Pilani.. The visits to the temple..so serene.and the cycle rides..sandwiches at sky.. dinner in IC and then juice at C'not.. :P  Our futile breakfast attempts.. The walk in the rain with you and Pranjali infront of the Chief Warden's home..sitting on the circles and singing :P ...Going to akshay n searching for lemons :P  Cheese Pasta  and Shik... ( lime juice ..forgot what it was called :P ) in the Reddys...the not so good chat we had in the market place,  with the fear of jaundice .. n marriage we attended :P ... Searching for children's park..n trying to remove kids and sit on those tyre swings with no idea when they might yield...  how I would wake you up everyday and you would be like 5 mins..n sleep again.. n hence we would be always late :P  These are the memories which shall always stay with me.  You were always an \m/ company.. very dependable..whenever I would be like..yahan jaana hai..you would be like chal ..with a fantastic smile.. My PS evenings became soo special becoz of you.. The last hug which I gave you when we were leaving .. though we had to meet again..it felt like the end of an \m/ time of my life.. And indeed they were one of the best times of my life.. Love you always ,.All the best for your future.. May the glory of Miss Fantastic spread far and wide :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>Hmm .. Anjali ..!!  crazy .. keh diya .. bas keh diya ..!!  :P  haha sasta for a sasti girl ..!! A very energetic girl who always engages herself in competition with me and falls head first 
But always stands again shamelessly when an opportunity comes ..!! Your love for copying me in everything I do is immense and i respect you for that .. _/\_  :) . I first met you with a request of helping me in a task which is still to be completed ..  you promised to help me but ..!!And then we became good aquaintances and started having 
li8 talks ... this situation became quite different when the first summer vacations came and our day started with good morning on fb and ended with good ni8 , dafa ho..  crsly 
bhagana padta hai ise .. bolti hi rhti hai !! But these talks built up a great relationship and understanding between us .. We started chatting every day ..  and our vacations passed 
within no time !!  Then we actually starting interacting with other in campus . It always felt very comfortable taking to you .. you have that style which makes the person you talk to 
feel at ease .. You always cry on all matters .. but that is very kiddish and cute .. feels like consoling u evrytime .. :D .. U are a person on whom i can play all types of pranks without 
even thinking once ...thats how comfortable i am with u .. we always had a common way of thinking when it comes to society and doing a job honestly .You have this fantastic 
ability to convince people ( if u really want )to u r terms by constantly requesting them to accept for long time until they deny .. Crsly .. no one can ignore that innocent face u make 
at those times  and gets trapped :P .We went to a lot of outings in our second year .. spent some quality time in classes messaging each other and you constantly trying to wake me 
up in between the classes by calling me on my mobile  ... haha ..Still remember times in DEM when you tried to wake me up twice but i didnt .. and the next moment was caught by 
Anita mam .. haha she almost begged me to tell the fact that was she so boring ..!!  :P that was a lucky escape .And then came PS-1 . It was the time when i talked to you the most and it will be one of the most interesting things I ll remember from my stay in aurangabad...All these idiotic talks about pilani , wedding crashers ,  about u r past bf's and crushes ... and also mine .. talking about useless topics (drinks) at least a couple of hours on every alternate day ... You actually know quite a lot of secrets which no one has ever known here ..! Me reciting the menu when I would be in the restaurant and you crying heavily for getting at least one of them there and then me asking you to pay the bill .. lol ..!! Me calling You every time when i had Pani puri .. and your discomfort increased as u cud barely manage pani in pilani .. pani puri to li8 ..  !!  haha .. bad one .. i know ..!!  :P . It was the time when we started addressing each other with DUDE .You actually asking to talk to sriram ... was amm .. mindblowing  :P  Due to our long talks my ps mates asking me sometimes whether you are my gf ..  damn .. kismat footi meri ..!!  :-\  . Then came the third year when we got busy with our cdcs but always managed to support each other on topics most common to us such as SPREE .. And here we are towards the end of such a nice journey . I think I got lucky to having meet you here in bits where i came to know that girls can be this nautanki .. DUDE bahot badi nautankibaaz hai tu ..  ;). There have always been tough times where in we all were disturbed but I think it was our understanding which always kept us in good terms with each other ..always .. which would have been very difficult otherwise ..!!! I must say you are a strong girl and a great frnd who finds me sincere :P  and am confident that you will be successful in life however tough the situation is .. I wish you all the best and DUDE ... you rock ..!!  :D  mrs fantastic ...  haha .!!  :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>

<p>Anjali ….. actually I want to say a lot of things……but i wont. Probably some of my best memories of this campus are related with u. Speaking of u…..i just can say that u r a very friendly person….quite moody……high tempered……kiddish always…..a typical girl (with all ur fantasies and bitching :P)… always want to be the centre of attraction…..likes to show off a little….and even compete in few ‘things’ :P. Sometimes she is stubborn….she cant think reasonably…..but she also tries to bury her emotions deep down somewhere….as u only said…I can still tell u dat by just having a look at ur face. I would just like to finish off by saying that …..wherever u go……whatever u do …..jus stay happy. I wish u touch highest of the peaks in every sphere of life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anchit-saini">Anchit Saini</a></p>
<p>Anjali..or "angel" as i call her..a girl who can always surprise you, either with her determination to do things she wants to do, her temper, her mood swings, or with keeping it all inside her for ages..she has a personality that not many can compete with..the perfect equilibrium between professional attitude and sweetness..u can easily be mesmerized by it.. But behind the bold determined anjali, there lies a sweetheart..a very good friend, one of those who ll show u very honestly what she feels about you..i really respect that in you anjali, the way u stand for urself, ur decisions, and even ur friends. We have spend a lott of time with each other, both happy and sad..and through the years, it feels like you were there always..Its so good to just see this girl with her bigg smile, always cheered up with her enthu..even though she would be facing a hurricane inside her head..gives u motivation that everything will be settled, just keep smiling.. what i love the best about her is that for everything and anything n this world, she has got an opinion,and she stands by it firmly..no matter what others think..not many people have the courage to do it..and yaa..i just love how our opinions match..one of the few persons i dont have to explain what went wrong, coz shes there shouting and thinking with the same intensity as me..!! very ambitious for her desires, she does whatever she gets involved in perfectly,be it physics or spree..but then shes just tooo lazy to do things she doesnt wanna :P...shes is very confused at times,and its awsum to see her crib about something else that moment, although all of us know that baat kuch aur hi hai.. to the world shes this independant determined ms.fantastic, but with her friends she needs a lot of pampering and support..and thatsss sooo sweet angel,coz thats what friends are for..!!and although people dont admit, they love to do it coz thats what anjali is,and shes worth it all.... I really cant rite explicitly what you mean to me, but yaaa the time we shared together has a large part of my brain occupied..i know that the moments we share has a very weird manner..but just want to say that it was a hell of an experience..and i know that u feel i dont share with u much, but angel i really dont need to..without saying, u also know that we understand a lot about each other..and it feels stupid to waste the small time we get telling about daily errands..and with u, it never mattered to prove that we r dere for each other, coz we were just there..always..backing up whenever lows hit each other.. and thats what i love about our friendhip..!! Anjali, a great life is waiting for you ahead,just live it with the awsumness u have..!!  I hope u get all the happiness in the world..!! just luv u girl, u rock..!!! :) :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tapsi-dubey">Tapsi Dubey</a></p>
