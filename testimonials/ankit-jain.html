<p>The first senior whose name would pop in my mind every time i needed help was Ankit Jain. He is an amazing guy who you can count on any time in your life for help. Every time you pass by, he flashes a brilliant smile no matter you are a senior or a junior to him. He is a very down to earth, friendly and approachable person. If you ever feel low, i strongly recommend you talk to him them, he has this aura around him that makes every one besides him cheerful and jolly. He lives life to it's best and  I hope his love for Bio takes him places. Wish you loads of luck and success. And keep guiding your juniors like you always do :)

<p>He is the most lively person i have ever seen on campus. No matter what he is going through, he will always make it a point to flash a smile to the one passing by. He has an aura that makes the people around him cheerful. A wonderful senior indeed and very helpful as well. He is flamboyant , open about this thoughts and ideas and doesn't hesitate to share them with anyone. I have only one request from you, no matter where life takes you never change your nature.

<p>The Ankit Jain (TAJ) is the face of biology of our batch. He has loads of tolerance. Besides being trustworthy, and having carefree attitude, he is fun loving and entertaining as well. He dances quit well. He is open minded and friendly in nature. He is a very confident speaker who never hesitates to share his thoughts. Blessed with dedication and sincerity, he certainly has a great future ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>Hmm Ankit ..!!   A one liner for him  "Respect is something you earn. You earn it simply by being a real, genuine person at all times. Not being scared to be yourself , ever!"  .This line summarises evrything about him .An individual who is always genuine, not even a hint of cunningness in his nature and that is what makes him unique .  I have a great deal of respect for him no matter wat his image is in the rest of people's minds. He may irritate you in your good times  ( oh yes ..!!.. he is talent apart ..  :P)  but he will be the first peron whom you can  confide upon to help you . A great BIO freak .. crsly ..!!  I can bet you cant be sad wen he is in 10mts of range ..!!  One thing i would like to say , people talk about you taking time out of their "busy " schedule . Hence you have something special that people envy ..!!  Dont ever change yourself you are the best person at heart i have ever met ..!!  All the best for u r future  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>

<p>I met him in my 1st year and you've been a friend of mine ever since. You're the most caring person 1 could ever imagine. If BITS is a dessert then you're the water in it. Undoubtedly, the biggest bio freak of the campus, probably even more passionate then our Bio faculty... You handle events pretty well. A person who is extremely devoted to friends. I'm so much impressed by your ability to understand problems so effortlessly. Lastly, thanks for all those Panjiri, laddoo, cake and all the things you take from home.. Your memories will not fade in my life...You were my friend and will always remain as that special friend of mine.. Best of luck for future and have a great life ahead..!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>I remember, I met you first time during Quark 2010 first meeting and since the very day, our friendship grew stronger and stronger. He is an outrageous guy seriously! have not seen a person like him before with so much energy weather being at work, play or anywhere else. Working alongside you for three good years has really helped me to know you better. You are one of the very few people in my entire life who is able to understand the real me. Though I hate him a bit for calling me "Introvert" but he has been a true friend. Not to mention he's honest, hard-working, supportive, hilarious, very lively, courageous and most important of all very kind (which is hard to find) but I seriously hate him for being hasty. But never ever think to change because this defines you. Thanks for all the advice, as it always helped, and I wish you all the very best for a great satisfying future ahead :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>TAJ (The Ankit JAin) there was no one like him and there never will be anyone like him. He’s unique person. He’s known to annoy people and over interpret simple things. He irritates me soo much in the lab. When in mood I used to poke him on petty things and we used to quarrel almost every day in lab. He’s super passionate about BIOLOGY. He has a left a everlasting impression on every one. He’s a great guy , fun to hang out with. Very difficult to work with. Has great people skills. He’s hard working. But one thing stands out is even if you suppress his idea, he will come up with some new one. It been a pleasure to do labs with him nahi to lab mein time pass kaise hota :P. I hope he has a great future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>

<p>I met Ankit in my first year and has been my dear friend since. He is always a person who will seriously listen to my problems. He has an effervescent personality and is good to everyone. He knows his strengths and his weaknesses more than most of the others and is extremely hard working. I deeply admire him for the kind of person he is, and I thank him for all the support that he has given me over the two years. He will be one of my most special and dear seniors. Best of luck bhaiyya, and stay in touch. :-) :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>

<p>TAJ is the only person in BIO batch who is dedicated towards pursuing something in biology(cheers!!). A very helping person will not deny if you ask him for help. He has this never give up attitude which make him different from others(sometimes in annoying sense). I will always remember your and "Nyati" clashes altough they may be bad experience for you but funny for me. Stay in touch and best of luck for your future endeavours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>
<p>I've known ankit since 1st sem, back then I used to stay away from him fearing he would get me angry with his over-talkative nature! But in 2-1, I had no way out but to resist him in Bio pre-CDC's. In the due course of time, I realised what an amazingly high energy level this person has!!...Never have I heard from him that he is tired. Always ready and absolutely no hesitation to do anything (Remember going to Srikant Sir's home @midnight for bio buk...lol). Our first Calangute trip...that was an experience of its own. It wouldn't have been fun without ankit and his 'jungleepan'. He was always there to offer his help (whether his help was required or not ! :P :P). Gives awesome expressions, me & sud used to watch his expressions in gen bio class, that was real fun!!!. Besides all this, a very very kind hearted person, loves his family a lot. A friend to cherish for life. Without him many things in my stay here would have lost meaning..bio labs, his annoying busy schedule during fests:P, pre-CDC's, etc. A great person, full of passion fr bio. May he achieve (m sure he will) success in whatever path he chooses in life. All d best dude...stay like this!!! :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>
<p>Ankit...lots of things to be said..it has been just a few days that I've known you..but no doubt,I see you as  one of my closest friends on campus..and i was thinking of writing a testimonial long back..but just few minutes back i realised that today was the last day..and i started immediately...you're so friendly...it's surprising.. we share a great chemistry...i realize that we just met by chance...and we somehow got along so well,which i should mention, doesn't come to me so easily and i never thought it'll go this way..but i hope the bond lasts...ok enough about our friendship..now thoda sa about you...you are such a dynmic personality...so honest..so frank..so straight-forward...never let this enthusiasm die..although you could try to be a li'l less irritating..umm..not irritating exactly..less stubborn..yeah..you're very kind at heart..and you do keep worrying about things however much you may deny it.. :P (PS-I am assuming that by now you know who's written this.. :P) ..thoughtful...mature..sincere..and so much fun to hang around with...(though you keep meri udaoing :P :P)...that's all...Wish you all the luck,all the happiness...Keep that smile on..always.. :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>very enthusiastic about bio..a class will not go without him asking doubts or a teacher picking on him!...but he NEVER gets offended..and thats the best thing about him :) Very sporty and good at heart ... We have not known each other much but its been great fun having you around in the labs, Ankit...... All the very best for future!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>
<p>Undoubtedly the most annoying, talkative bum around and an absolute pain in the rear... He can drive you up the wall with his one-liners.. It was damn good to have someone just like me when it comes to driving people nuts. His cheerful attitude, ever-so-positive vibes and booming laughter always worked in lightening the place up. He can be surprisingly remarkable when he has bouts of hysteria and dances away magnificently.. He is a great talker and can convince even the most hardcore cynics.  A great friend and mate, TAJ gave me some really memorable moments when we used to discuss all kinds of stuff over a cuppa at the library steps, hostel gate and just about anywhere private!! ;)
Would certainly like to have your friendship for life :) :)
