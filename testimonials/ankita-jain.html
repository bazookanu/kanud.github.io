<h1 class="page-title">Ankita Jain</h1><p>Boss!!  I would love to see your hair open more frequently…. Don’t forget us when you go far…:) Happy life to you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khayali-jain">Khayali Jain</a></p>
<p>i remember her as the girl studying QIC with akriti... started with our daily meals... she soon became a very close friend... classes of MuP and DECO wouldn't hav been possible without me irritating her all throughout :P a sweet caring attitude, with a strict routine of sleeping (and eating of course :P), she is the most sincere in our group. i love her hard-working nature, her sincerity towards her studies, her happy-go-lucky attitude,a nd her evr-smiling face. Stay the way u r :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankita-mahapatra">Ankita Mahapatra</a></p>
<p>The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about her is her sincerity and dedication. She is the only one among us who always has some sensible and important topics to discuss (baki sab toh 90% of the time bakwaas hi karte hain (including me of course ;))). I got to know her from our common class of Physics in first year. We had an elective together and if she hadn’t been there to wake me up (and that’s pretty difficult :P) and force me to study, I wouldn’t have been able to handle the course alone. And how can I forget the most important thing – if we have spent on an average 360 hours per year in mess, we spent 90 hours per year waiting for her to finish her meal (phew!!!) (although most of the time it was fun just staring at her and asking her to eat fast). We have one more semester together and I am sure that we will have great time together as always :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
