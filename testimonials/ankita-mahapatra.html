<h1 class="page-title">Ankita Mahapatra</h1><p>A very helpful and jolly person, she goes out of the way to help people. A kid at heart, I will always remember your longing for cakes, your love and affection for children (she starts playing with any kid no matter what the place).  A true friend and an excellent critic. I will never forget you scolding me and pulling me back on track whenever I lost confidence in myself. All those 8 am classes couldn’t have been possible without you. She is the alarm clock for the whole corridor :P . Her room is the common room for many people, be it for exam time preparation, for Maggie sessions or for endless discussions on pointless topics. I will always cherish all the moments we shared. Thank you for making my college life wonderful :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
<p>Our abberated version of small wonder :P , Ankita is full of life, full of affection, care and love. Very playful and carefree and cake-a-holic!
Actually, she can be the “Monica Geller” among my Friends…cleanliness, competitiveness, obsession and relationships!!! Full of warmth and the ‘mother of all’. 
I’ve spent numerous hours lying in your room, narrating my stupid tales, forcing you to make maggi for me, emptying almost all of your food reserves..and yes every time I’ve opened my books, it has been in your room(rem, I made u learn my cdc courses :P). I secretly enjoy the arguments with you and your advices which I seldom take! Without you, it’s incomplete. You are the one I’ve bugged the most. Thank you for being there :) . Wish you all the success in life… will miss your ever infectious hugs <3

<p>I've known Ankita since workshop days! She's one really intelligent girl ! And i must have asked for help in every subject and every assignment possible :P but she's always been there to help me and guide me with everything :) We had some good times in the Dance Club also, the practices and all the outings. It has been great knowing you. Thanks for all the help :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>

<p>Ankita!! Well, to honestly write about her we started off on a wrong foot. We  were hardly friends and I have to admit was a bit disappointed to have her in my MT2 lab group but after a while, we could get along well and having fun when we started to know each other better. She is a perfectionist I can say that cause in mt2 lab she would make sure each and every reading of ours is correct, which was good coz in the end she would normally do all the expts while we fooled around! :P. Now, she is one my best friends and confidants . Kind, fun-loving, helpful, kid at heart, caring (sometimes gets into her mummy mode :P which is good when ur ill but really bad when its coz ur bunking classes ) but sometimes gets too mean when it comes to being a critic (i still hate u for that!) You can go to her with any problem (academic and otherwise) she will never disappoint you and manages to leave you with a smile. She always keeps a big stock of chocolates (FALERO!!) and very generously allows me to attack it! She is a very good dancer and a beautiful singer (she is a constant radio in classes :P.. even in exams for that matter when u have to ask her to shut up! )  She is the most chilled out person I know and takes life as it comes and sees things for what they are. I really like her attitude towards life and the way she handles tension! Super fun to hang around this eni buddy sometimes talks total bakwaas, without which my whole of 3rd year would have been completely different and totally boring! The all-nighter cadence assignments we did together weren’t soo boring n tedious as they would have been otherwise. Ankita! I have enjoyed arguing with you and irritating you especially coz u get soo annoyed by it! I am not saying goodbye to you as yet my dear friend, we still have one whole sem together for masti! Good luck! Cheers :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/disha-pramod-gujar">Disha Pramod Gujar</a></p>
<p>Ankitaa!! The born mother of our group :) and i believe evryonne knows abt dat now :) Yeah i remember our first adventurous trip to the tailor aunty but u forgot ki she dint repair my bag :P Instead that small resto guy did :P Ab if i start writing about d times spent in ur room it wud be like summarizing my whole 3 year stay in this campus which is not possible :P Whenever i feel lyk being silent,i can just cum to ur room and rest on ur lap a while (dnt take it oderwise :P ) and its so great. U hav always been dere all the tym.U have been so caring and so affectionate,scolding me to take medicines or to study during exams or abt sleeping  the whole day.And yeah how can i not mention u being my alarm clock for 3 years and for 1 more sem to come :P I wud never hav managed to go to any of my morning classes if it ws not for u :) Thank uuu soo much :) Amazing amount of patinece u have (which is needed considering u have to wake me).Now imagine my 4-2 morn classes when u arent dere :( :P Whenever i enter hostel i hav to knock urs nd poorwa's room before entering mine for every small reaon and i love doing that :) I remember sem1 when we guys were struggling for completing our course and u wud cum all happy wid course completed and wud go to bed :P uske baad sem 2 se toh our grp studies in ur room dont need details :) she will always make it a point to open up all food which she gt frm home when all of us together.

<p>I don remember wen i 1st met her... but as far as I can recall... I can alwayz remember her sitting next to me in classes :P. I remember how we used to sing random songs under Mane's nose in CAS classes :P.Ankita is one of the warmest and most generous of all the people. I can never thank her enough for generously giving me her notes just before exam. N that she taught me micro with such patience _/\_. Whenever I bunk a class or don't understand a topic..at da back of my mind I think its ok Ankita is der (don mind :P ). Her room is one of da cleanest... i can alwayz get a very pleasant aura on visiting her room. My fellow mate in Eni..very intelligent :). Shez never bashful about voicing her opinions (evn to anita agarwal in mup :P). Ankita is a true friend, who will walk the extra mile with u without hesitation...I will really miss sitting next to her in class n bugging her wid my doubts :P.I hope u alwayz carry this charm n confidence with you wherever u go. U will undoubtedly be at the head of ur chosen career :). I wish u all da very BEST! aur touch mein rehna :)
