<h1 class="page-title">ANKITA SAXENA</h1><p>So Ankita yaaarr!!… She lives in a fairy tell and dreams yaaarrr!!  ..still whenever there are small issues, her life becomes full of tragedy.. “Kyaaa tragedy hai yaaarrr!!”? … She is very fair, beautiful and really sweet.  She always has solutions for any problem… and the solution is always accompanied by “the great ankita’s theory”… there are special “ankita’s quotes” also specially on relationships ? ;) 
She is very brilliant, not at all sincere and total fun and full of gossip!! I enjoy talking with her …with her company I laugh a lot… There are many new words I have learned from Ankita.. She maintains her own dictionary which contains self created hindi words… (like padhantu=padhaku etc)
In all she is great and very sweet….bless u dear … may ur dreamed fairy tell come true!! Have an exciting happy future!! ?

<p>Anki-the-monkey!!!
Have to start with "YAAAAAAAAAAAAR....."lol... only those of you who know her will get this joke!!! She's amazing...i mean she has an awesome sense of humour... Her life is full of tragedies(spelt Tra-Je-Dy):D... and she makes jokes out of it and recites it in such a sing-song manner that makes others laugh around her... I like her attitude.. she is very Li8... and i like her philosophies in life... She also has a very peculiar lingo.. originated frm CG(Chattisgarh).. some of her words include Dehati(not to be confused with Haati..:P), Chamkana and Padhantu.... lol seriously... i mean she makes her own vocab... which is very innovative... she also teaches hindi to others..(some words are unwritable...;)) and she feels that everyone is very shy towards her.... she is my favourite person to mimic..she is so unique and special that mimicing her gives me immense pleasure and to others as well!!!
I just dont like her long nails... was always scared of long pointed objects!!!
 Keep up the positive attitude towards life anki... Hope u find pleasure and success in all your endeavours... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-baokar">Ishaan Baokar</a></p>
