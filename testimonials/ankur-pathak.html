<p>I am not gonna bother writing you a proper testimonial. That would imply, we may lose touch in the future and this will constitute a memory. You know too many of my secrets, and I will have to kill you before I can let you go.

<p>Pataka! (did I see you cringe?) Yes I will call you that again. I absolutely have to begin with "you were fine five minutes ago"... that did help you know! And I am not just saying it because you're going away and stuff. :P Long, long chats and stupid games. Thank you for scaring the hell out of me so many times (gin is for the ladies said somebody remember?) Thanks for suicide point, you always will get the credit for that oh and for sheela too! Nice places. Oh and will you finally call me leo please? I might go on and on since you know I am capable of that, I think I should stop here.
All the luck in life!

<p>Pro aadmi.. The person who hasn't changed his habit of sleeping at 10 even after spending 3 years in BITS. He hold a record for spending maximum number of  days in BITS without laptop.very strong in concepts. He can play all kinds of sports that also very well. I enjoyed all the labs that we attended together and all the discussions we have had during the labs.
Good AOE player indeed.

<p>If I ever give one of those correlation tests, you know – “What’s the first thing you think off when I say…” - I’ll probably answer Ankur for rum (Just kidding, I’ll actually say, “WHERE?!”) Jokes apart, Ankur was one of the first friends I made on campus (weird story, we both had the same phone and we both liked the Doors) and thank god I did. I owe him big time for his role in the great Bogmalo man-hunt. And following incidents as well (remember, lambda equals two?). He’s been epic fun to hang out and have random conversations with, be it Bogmalo or Velino’s and has patiently put up with all my ‘irresponsible behavior’ in either place – which is why it is also a good thing that he’s now in Pune. His obsessions with ‘the fauj’ & concepts generally worm their way into any conversation involving him. We share many common tastes in music. I count him as one of my best friends, one who’ll stick after college as well, ‘cause he’s taught me one of the most important lessons of my life: “Don’t Mix”<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>

<p>Here's to a friendship made in heaven. And yes, we found heaven, probably spent the best part of our first year there. Pathak is one of the most knowledgeable and entertaining people in our batch,  giving out life-lessons with a glass of rum-pani,his elixir, in his hand. Pathak is also a brilliant sportsman, a great football and squash player, and also tennis. We've had epic fun together,but next year is gonna be even better.Meanwhile, Aoe @ 60, join fafafafafafaafafa! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
