<h1 class="page-title">Ankush Khurana</h1><p>When I met Ankush for the first time, I thought, he is kind of those intellectuals with posession of all earthly knowledges, calmness and composure. I couldn't have been more wrong.
Gifted with a unique brain that could easily outperform a supercomputer with 64000 processors, in his heart, he is still every bit of the child now as he was twenty years ago.
He is smart, intelligent, funny and the true playboy of our batch. He gets angry faster than the shift time of an Audi R8, and then cools down even faster. 
But he is the best of best friends one could possibly have. Thanks for being our friend.

<p>If I have to thank ppl who helped me finish ME, first and foremost I wud thank Ankush_/\_ I dont know how many times I have called him on the day b4 exam and asked him to teach me. He is blessed with 2 supernatural powers. One, the superfast Arithmetic logic Unit of his brain. Who else can calculate products, square roots of weird looking numbers in no time without calci or even pen n paper at times?? And 2nd one is ability to listen, understand, take notes during lectures while SLEEPING..:D I donâ€™t remember seeing him awake in any lecture..Still he always had all notes, knew everything and even remembered wat teachers spoke.. HOW man??? But yes..he used his superpowers for welfare of entire class, Be it group study or doing totaling of over 1000 papers during paper checking. And not to forget his hatke thinking, if not an engineer, he wud have been a detective (#InterpolInterviewQuestions). Hes Smart, Intelligent, and sweet. Million thanks for helping me and Hope u continue helping me Paypal as well :P Hope all your dreams come true as soon as possible (including Audi :)). All the best, Have a blessed life..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mallika-desai">Mallika Desai</a></p>
<p>I may have missed this testimonial section if this guy had not notified me. I am starting with this line coz , similarly I might have missed most of the activities,events, assignments and almost everything here at BITS if Ankush had not reminded me on them. Thanks a lot for helping me complete the degree by informing me and being my primary alarm for each and everything. I always wanted some1 to support me wherever I was. And here it was Ankush and Philip. This guy is smart, wherein the word "smart" has a lot of meanings.
For him the definitions are, good understanding skills, emotional control over oneself and one's activities, in terms of social behavior, reacting to life events, taking wise decisions, supporting others  with the right words at the right time, making friends and dealing with strangers, and lot more. 
He , in spite of his age, is mature than anyone else in our class(though Mallika is exceptionally mature ;) ) and that is the one thing I respect about him. [Actually I had a second thought when I wrote this word 'mature' and he fact which was pulling me back was that he loved to watch 'big boss' and 'vampire diaries' real badly :P]

I should say that he is one of the true friends I have in my life and will I never let him go loose. He would be one among my friends whom I would love till my life ends. And Ankush you earned it(eventhough it maynot be a big thing for you :D) . I should say this is the only guy about whom I would truly say I love him in the campus apart form Philip ;).  And do remind me of taking you to kerala and always you are welcome home.

Sincerely,
Davis
