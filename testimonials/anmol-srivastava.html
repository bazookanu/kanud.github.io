<h1 class="page-title">Anmol Srivastava</h1><p>Anmoooooooool, you are one of the most amazing ppl i have met. It's always soooo much fun to  have you around. You will be one of the few persons that I am really gonna miss. The ni8 outs, the mind blowing gossip sessions, the walks together, the time when we used to take case of pinku, etc etc.... all are such wonderful memories coz of u.. Apart from this, I would also like to say you are smart, fun loving, daring, sexy and very friendly person.. Wish you all the best for your future. With loads of love<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/garima-agarwal">Garima Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Vivacious, jolly,hard-working, dedicated,,passionate these are just some of the words, that one can think of while describing Anmol. Having worked with her in DoJMA for more than three years, I have seen her outstanding work, both when it comes to writing and management. Her stint as the Waves Coordinator for DoJMA was magnificent , where she and the department came up with some impressive pre and post festival issues, and a well managed press corps. She has been instrumental in bringing out the best of the Department at varied occasions, and has displayed ample leadership qualities.  Apart from DoJMA, Anmol is one of the most interesting people to talk to, and one is sure to gain something after interacting with her. She has also shown her academic prowess from time to time in both technical and non technical field; in the process adding tongue in cheek humour to it . (who can forget that demand for 40% Quota for A grade for IS community in DSA after the RPJ notice). At the end, I can say, that Anmol has been one intelligent, diligent, dependable and spirited lady, and I wish her loads of luck for her future.   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>
<p>Anmol! the best thing about u is that you are always such a pleasure to be around, and i really mean it! u have an amaaaaaaazing sense of humour n u really make me laugh! i really loved all the times we spent, be it in giving presentations, in studying, playing baddy, and u being my partner in EEEP labs :D and ofcourse, the time we spent in dudh sagar also needs a special mention. i loved all those gossip sessions n little outings. You are a really intelligent, vibrant, full of life, very pretty, sporty, talented, and yeah, kind of messy non OCD person but i dont have a problem with that, maybe swechha might :P  haha...always stay this way n do keep in touch..love you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tara-ramanan">Tara Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Anmol why didn't we talk in 1st and 2nd year? Why! You are so awesome! I have so many memories with you in just 1 year, and I swear I wouldn't have been able to go through those CN assignments all night long if it wasn't for all the fun we had together. I'm so thankful to those OS labs because if you remember, thats what got us talking, and before I knew we were already having these amazingly fun gossip sessions all night! Smart and ambitious with a brillaint sense of humor, thats what makes you so awesome and unique. And never change because you're perfect like this. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>I will perhaps always remember Anmol as the girl with the unusual name and the even more unusual sense of humour. One of the most hard-working, 

dedicated, passionate, awesomest members of DoJMA ever, she made Waves her personal priority over the few crazy weeks leading up to the fest in her 

capacity as the festival coordinator. Vivacious, funny, bright with a mean definition of humour, she adds colour wherever she goes; sometimes too 

much colour if you manage to get on the wrong side of her famed temper. Notable examples include the time during the spree treasure hunt in which she 

spent half her waking hours cussing us ( I wouldn't blame her, really :D). Probably the best Waves co-ordi of DoJMA till date, she handled the fest 

extremely well and made everything a smooth matter, leading her team with great skill and determination. An absolutely lively person to be with, 

she's a been an amazing friend all these years, not just a colleague in the department. Will remember all those splendid discussions we had on every 

damn topic under the sun on gtalk (remember our 1000 line chat? :D). She maintains a cool and rational head, which helps her speak sense for most of 

the time. Her opinions have always turned out to be ear-worthy, and opinions she does have on most of things around the world. Have a gained a lot of world-view through all our talks, chats, random gossip here and there. Will treasure all the splendid times we spent together in those never-ending meetings, mongi and strangely enough, CAT and opti classes. As Pandey mentioned, you are one hell of a spirited lady! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>One of the most sensible girls i know! Right head about each thing, knows just what to say to make someone feel better or to make a friend come back to the right track :P
She is obviously fun to hang out with and has a very pleasant spontaneity in hilarious discussions.It's been really good to know you Anmol.Always stay in touch! And all the best for your future( though i know you'll fodufy looking at the graph of success of your sisters :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>
<p>Initially, we both thought of each other as… well, idiots. But then, before Waves Anmol decided to give me a chance and I’m so glad she did. She’s a great listener, very receptive to ideas, has a good deal of common sense and is humorous in an unconventional way. Very unconventional ways (I guess there’s no turning back after South Park). All in all, there’s more to her than meets the eye. So making that Waves blog with her turned out to be real fun!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>She is one person whom i've met who can multi-task effortlessly,amiable,dedicated towards studies,very good with words,has a brilliant vocabulary,fun-loving person,specializes in stealth and other forms of trickery(chor!! :P),sometimes keeps babbling and i just have to nod my head in agreement :P(yes it has happened!!),i will never forget the fight i had on our way back from arambol(you started it!)......you dont want to get on the wrong side of her......she'll chew you to pieces :P....some good memories include the trip to palolem in 2-2(remember the dog incident? :P)and of course the arambol trip....
i wish you all the best for the future and please do keep in touch!
PS: i think chor aunty was ingenious of me....! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-ramanan">Paritosh Ramanan</a></p>
<p>meri pyari anmol,
maine kabhi socha nahi tha ki zindagi mujhe kisi din is mod pe lakar khada karegi ki hum ek doosre ko alvida keh rahe honge.. :P kabhi tu ek shaitan si bacchi hai, to kabhi ekdum samajhdar dost.. kabhi teacher ki tarah padhane lagti hai, to kabhi padhai karne nahi deti.. In 3 saalon mein humare beech jo pyari nokjhok  hui main sabse jyada usi ko yaad karungi.. i am really gonna miss you anmol..  i remember our first nightout in hostel, our first ragging and so many great times.. i just wish i could spend more time with you.. stay in touch and keep troubling me.. :P Love you.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/avni-goyal">Avni Goyal</a></p>
<p>none of the usual 'girly' adjectives can define this female so i guess her name is something normal about her! first year was rocking with u! exploring this campus together! and yeah thanks for supporting and pushing me through my bizzare decisions :) love the spirit u carry around !! and yeah clean ur room before one of ur  bua comes around :P dojma cordi and all that being blah blah ur biggest achievement is probably having survived ur room! :P  hopefully a parallel universe is building in ur room somewhere :P good luck for whatever u eventually decide to do :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apurva-mudgal">Apurva Mudgal</a></p>
<p>Anmol is the life of any group she hangs out with!! Very active, chirpy and sweet she never lets anyone fell bored around her. And she does speak a lotttt, all the time :) She is good at everything, be it Acads, extra curricular activities or having fun :) She is also an awesome writer.  In IS she is specially known for her "CHALO CHALO CHALO " dialogue :P Had a gr8 tym with you at the IS trips. All the best for your life ahead and do keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sonali-bhadra">Sonali Bhadra</a></p>
<p>Anmol is one power package, filled with lots and lots of energy, fun and enthu. Has one of the cutest smiles I've ever come across :D (really), and is known amongst IS people as 'that girl who bunks classes but rapes subjects', well atleast I know her that way . There's hardly anytime you get bored around her. I wonder why Altec Lansing doesn't benchmark their loudest volume wrt your voice when arguing (esp during trips :D) Lots and lots of cherishable memories in the Doodhsagar outing and the Arambol one. Especially Doodhsagar. "Chalo Chaloo Chalooooo" :D. I've known her since 2k9 freshers. Went lite on the ragging part since you listened to LP back then. You can thank me later for that :P. You'll always be remembered as the most dynamic and entertaining girl I've ever met :D. All the best for your future, don't forget to treat me on your fodu placement next sem, and lastly, stay in touch :D
PS: Thanks for enduring me and Dhee during farewell ;)... Keep rocking X-D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/goutham-harsha">Goutham Harsha</a></p>
<p>Well, I'd leave talking about how experience was with you in DoJMA. That, I already told you. :) Other than that, as far as I've heard, I've seen and I've observed, you're one who could be trusted, who could be lived with, joyfully. Your cuteness can bring up a smile on anyone's face, even if you cracked a PJ. Besides the hardwork I've seen you doing, your always-helping attitude adds a lot of goodness to your personality. I wish this is not the end and we'll meet more. . . cuz I have only 1 pic with you, and i'm not done yet. :P Keep Rocking! All the best for your future. And, try to stay in contact. :) And, 1 more thing - Don't let that smile ever disappear from your face. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavul-gauri">Bhavul Gauri</a></p>
<p>Anmol is one totally carefree girl who can bring a smile to just about anybody's face... for two whole years i lived one room away from her's and we never had a decent conversation... but the PSD puts us in this totally useless PS 1 station in the beautiful city of lucknow (dare you say anything about it ) and we click right away... Anmol is a chatty witty person with a great sense of humor.. she has a very accented hindi that makes some people say "Anmol aap kahan ki hain " :P ... She loves gossiping and never disappoints  me as far as that is concerned :) ... and everytime i cross her room my spirits lift... coz my mind says "See someone has a room that dirtier than yours" ... jokes apart.. we have had some beautiful memories together and i shall always cherish them... Hope you will always be in touch and wouldnt just switch to being "socially awkward" :P ...May you get the best in life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>after 1 complete year of same courses and elective too... the first time i talked to Anmol was at PS1 where both of us were stuck in a random place and rest everyone was enjoying at their home... it was so boring that we preferred to come to PS to pass time... went to McD, Dominos and Malls number of times to get through the 2 months of PS... after that my perception of she being the one with "Attitude" changed.. she's quite a fun person to hangout with... a very hardworking girl... managed Waves and still was able to get an awesome GPA... always keeps joking around and full of energy... enjoyed the few trips we had at Palolem, Dudhsagar (\m/) and Amboli... will surely miss your company... it was great to have a friend like you and hope to remain in touch in the future... Best of luck for the future (and placements next sem)!!!! Enjoy life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>If I were to describe this girl in one sentence... well... I did say "I can't!!". There are just too less words for this purpose. Straining my mind, I come up with some adjectives.. "A highly social and approachable animal", that makes good company to hangout with. A frank, open, entertaining,  passionate, dedicated, amiable (thanks to the flash cards of CL... :P), girl.. has a very unique way of living life. Although good at vocabulary, doesn't have the word "tension" in her dictionary. In-spite, I tried to tell her the meaning many times, during OS labs, instead she added synonyms of the word "lite" to it. Very systematic and enthusiastic to work... has leaded many group tasks.. already mentioned by many above. She has the ability to learn many things quickly... recently learnt the technique to acquire things that belong to  others without them knowing...(somebody mentioned that above .. :P). Anyways ... she is a fun person to talk to. Always keeps herself updated about what is happening around. Manages to get good grades without going to classes, a link between friends, quite a good manager, with a care-free lifestyle, and yet down-to-earth. Hope you make utilization of all the qualities in your upcoming life, and find the right place for yourself. Good Luck for your life ahead... be in touch!! :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyesh-shrivastava">Priyesh Shrivastava</a></p>
<p>Anmol!! ? you have been just awesome to work with. The only person I’ve come across who can actually push people to work, without them even realising it much. You’re definitely the most fun person in DoJMA. Chirpy, Waves Coordi who’s in IS :P .. I couldn’t have asked for a better mentor :)

<p>Her first impression is probably that of a streetsmart intelligent nerd,which is completely true.But she is also sports crazy,an amazing writer and a good manager.You'd think that is it..but then she goes on to surprise u with her unique sense of humour and her loyalty.A complete all rounder,she is also a truly amazing person.There are no pretences with her,she'l tell u like it is.Yes,she does tend to exaggerate sometimes,but she will always tell u what she thinks..whther its "u look fat" or "ur destroying ur life".She is completely  and irrevocably in love with her laptop,and rest assured u will never meet someone like her ever!
When we met on d very first day and went for orientation together,never did i think i'll be so attached to u.Our first yr still remains the most amazing time for me..our random talks,times with u and gari(except mayb the ones where u both teamed up against me.."rich girl":/),outings,carrom,the ranking and wht-u-think-of-each-person games,our crushes,neat sunday(:P),advanced bio talks(ahem!),dinner with u n jd(i actually considered that family time),dressing up,taking ur advice for everything,ur gyaan giving sessions(tho i dont rmbr a single thing from ur bitmun lectures).u've been my friend and family for all this time,taken care of me,called me on whatever bullshit i always seem to be doing,listen to me rant,told me what to do,shouted at me,slapped me!Though we had literally nothing in common,i still dont get led zep n u stil hate dance:P,we still managed to stay together throughout.One person who i tell everything to,the stupidest things to the most embarassing ones,cos somehow i need to tel u evrything.Sure,few things changed,but ul always me my crazy friend who i will tell everything,vent out on endlessly..and who will giv me a truthful(might be even harsh) opinion abt it.Eh,i didnt realise how emotional this became.so stopping now!
Stay ur crazy,direct(had to say that SOMEWHERE:P) self.

Luv u loads:)

p.s.-Since i kno how good u r at keeping in touch,i warn u beforehand,if i feel i'm being ignored.. i WILL break ur laptop and make u listen to all "my type" songs!!
p.p.s-It was bloody difficult writing for u,so dont u dare delete!!

<p>I have always been proud of my ability to pick out gems as friends. You were the first one i picked here in campus, even before you knew it. i remember the times in our first year, when in a very short time, the 6 became the 3+2+1 and it was so easy to part ways then. but i can't be more glad that you were the one i decided to hold on to. I am sure you know that you are a wonderful person, very funny, very intelligent, very lively, very smart bla bla.. but it's your honesty that brings me to you whenever i am in doubt. i know that you would look into my eyes and say the most hurtful thing to me if that were the right thing. And that’s what I love the most, because I would do the same to you! ?
The summer of 2011 will forever remain the most cherished time of my life in BITS (Even more than the one now ;) ) the laughter, the pain in the stomach which came with it, the tears in our eyes which would come because we wouldn’t breath out of laughing.. the way we teased ishita to death, the mangoes, the time when 3 people lived in CH5 320, the way you both teased me with all my lame Mumbai lingo and stupid pronunciations and “kaam wali bai aawaz”.. bloody hell you are the least teased person you know! ? Over the years, all the fresh new bitching sessions have come into picture too, but hell, everything is fun when you are around! The whole corridor lights up when you come up.. the way you tease avni and ishita :P and now you have this all new awesome bonding with swechha too (of which i am supremely jealous and insecure of btw ), it’s like we all wait for you to come up and put life around with your special touch. I know you love me the most (@swechha and @ishita: haah! :P ) and I promise you I will always remain the stupid kid with immature thoughts who comes to you for every little problem in life! 
You obviously know that you are one of the very few people I have shared my mind with.. all my problems, all my thoughts, they have come to you sooner or later.. the intense discussions we had about life, our sexy and rich and awesome future ( with a lot of money :D ), my silly first year thought-tangles.. it’s all coming to me now while I write this.. the time we did that epic symlog algo in the end moment in lib, the time when we cursed Argo UML (bloody sucker of a software  >.<), the time we watched that BBT episode before SE.. all the little little things.. :’)
Anyway, point is, I love you!

<p>I would remember the first day we met at the carom board in the first year and talked endless about all the subjects we could talk of… you seemed to be the most talkative in the group of six people talking!!!.. :) I remember you watching TV till late night in the first year (N ob nirmala yelling!)… Will never forget the First year exams in which I would always find you awake till late and then you would come to my room to discuss this formula and that sum… Am happy to see that that habbit of yours has remained through out and I still find you in my room when we have a course together.. It’s a comfort to know that someone is sailing in the same boat as yours!! :P …Have a happy journey ahead.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khayali-jain">Khayali Jain</a></p>
<p>Anmol Srivastava! Danger ka doosra naam hai! I-dun-remmber-the-name par tyre fenkne ki kisi competition ki champ type thi.. aur tabse main isse thoda door hi rehta hoon (:P) jokes apart, she is one of the most passionate people on campus about dojma, really hardworking, dedicated and far sighted. Very active, takes interest and leads people into things, she is also very radical in her actions, bole toh, kabhi kabhi bolti hai “use toh maar denge hum kabhi” “use to bulakar aisa dena chahiye na…” and tab main aur ankit bahot haste the.. ki yaar ye hai fodu! Other than that, ekdum cool bandi hai, u can talk o her about almost anything like a guy only, nakhre wakhre nahi karti! In the Waves coco, she was active in a lot of non dojma decisions, and for me, her input mattered a lot.. working with her for 2 years in DoJMA was quite an experience, and sometimes, her rationale, thoughts and leadership kinda gets to u.. it inspires you, pushes you. Fodu bandi hai, u have a long way to go! All the best, and be in touch! Cheers! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>
