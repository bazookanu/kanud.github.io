<h1 class="page-title">Anubhav Agrawal</h1><p>As the only Chief Election Commissioner who has had two CSA elections under him, he will be remembered in the history of BITS Goa. He had the guts to bring change to the system. What many people don't know is that he is also childish, funny, bubbly, friendly and throws a lot of tantrums. A great person to work with. A true friend for life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>This place is too small to talk about Anubhav. Street smart, cool, intelligent, funny and creative are some of the few words I have to describe him. He is one of my best friends. He is really creative, this I know because of his innovative ideas as we were preparing for CIMA GBC. The funniest thing about him is his capability to do mimicry of certain people I wouldn't like to mention here :P And he does it really well. The timing of his well put jokes, comments and lines on situations is awesome, specially on the Palolem Trip when he said to foreigners from distance, "Kyon bhai, hamara desh hai, hamari marzi, kahin bhi khelen!" I mean, oh my god, how does he gets those lines in his mouth. This guy has the ability to make any serious situation into a humorous one and that too in a good manner. Another great thing about Anubhav is his creativity. He has solution to every problem. The man is a moving giant encyclopedia of solutions. He is really intelligent and helpful. He is a friend always worth remembering. I wish him a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>I will always remember our first meeting, in front of the library, waiting for our turn to go inside the CC for our very first registration in this campus. We discuss about the which teachers to take, nd which to take lite... finally he asks which hostel, i reply- AH4(AH4 rocks BTW!!), he says me too! which room he asks next, i say 329. his reply- 328!! I said no way!! From that day on, the more i got to know him, the more awesome he got. His comic sense, his timing are always hilarious :D His obsession with sonu nigam, and old hindi songs just baffle me (bhai ab thoda bahut english bhi sunna start karde) and ofcourse there's his speakers, which the whole hostel knows of :P Then he was made the official Tshirt distributor of AH4. people used to come to his room, which was locked 80% of the time nd then mujhe aake gaali deke jaate the. I will always cherish these 3 years that i spent with him. All the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ahut-gupta">Ahut Gupta</a></p>
<p>Ok....so i was new to campus....standing alone in our corridor...feeling bored...suddenly comes anubhav agarwal and asks me,"chess khelne chal rha"...(wtf...ek toh pehle se hi bore ho rha hun upar se yeh chess khelne ki baat kar rhe hain..waah... chalo chalo chess khelenge)..as i was alone i agreed and went with this guy to play "CHESS"..after 1 full hour of boredom and no outcome of the match coming(thanks to his and my chess playing abilities) we quit the match and he went away talking on his phone....
that day and todays day....he is one of my best friends in campus(thanks to his railway background coz of which i never faced difficulty in ticket confirmations......bhaai 14th may ki bhi kara de),extremely hilarious,dedicated and hard working.he never leaves any work half done(kitna bhi bada portion ho exam ka sab karna hai.....bhaai pichle saal ke paper dekh liya kar)...thanx for all the wonderful memories(the maggi incident,all the train journeys which we did together and the way we studied for spm t2) ....these memories will never be forgetted and will remain fresh in my mind  all life....
ANUBHAV AGRWAL....TRUST ME.....U WILL NEVER BE FORGETTED...... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kushal-agarwal">kushal agarwal</a></p>
<p>They say that some friends are worth everything. Anubhav Agrawal, my alter ego in some aspects : 24x7 music is in our mind, cricket lovers, way too sensitive about things. A hell of a friendship which has almost seen it all. We became the best of friends in our very first weeks of college life, our daily arguments regarding SACHIN v/s SOURAV, our music obsession( his basically being for sonu nigam), then our year long fight which ended on that road trip accident. Sometimes, I regret a little as to how much time we lost because of that JAW-BREAKING fight, it was uncalled for. Well, he is a genius in many aspects, extremely dedicated individual, just the perfect blend of IQ and EQ( a little more towards EQ though :P), we have laughed, fought, our notorious kleptomaniacal adventures have been awesome, have learned a lot from you. May you achieve great things in life. All the very  best for your future mate, Keep smiling and irritating the hell out of everyone with your painful songs. CH1 will never ever be the same once he enters there( Sir peetoge sab ke sab) :P  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aruj-srivastava">Aruj Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Hmm,my very first testimonial goes to the guy who lives closest to me in the hostel,just across the door.Though I can only vaguely recollect our first encounter(wasn't more than just a customary greeting I think) what I do remember is playing chess(or carrom was it?)in the SAC on the very first day of College.The thing which immediately comes to mind from the early days are the numerous arguements we used to have over random stupid things like BITS vs IIT'S,Delhi vs Mumbai or over cricketers,singers,actors,corruption,crime and what not.However as days and months passed by , the bonding only grew stronger.Plenty of memories with him to cherish,right from dining together,studying together(the chem2 compre night rain!!),walking together(jungle!!!), swinging together(:P remember the merry go round!) playing together and many more.And yeah he is my unflinching partner in our newfound addiction(online shopping:P) and one more thing(this was originally his idea but aced by me over the years;)).As for his personal side,man I have never seen a more passionate supporter than him for the people he follows in life,read Sourav ganguly and Sonu Nigam(just a wish he may learn to respect that other people may have there own preferneces and may  not share his likings and thoughts).And ofcourse I need not say anything about his academics side,does exceedingly well in  most of his courses ,even though attends few of his lectures and sleeps through the others.Man i'm gonna miss his hilarious acts and unique comic timings.His cheesy comments and clamours from across the door will reamin etched in memory.And thats all i can conjure up at this point of time.All the best for your future yaar,a successful career and a  wonderful life awaits you:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-verma">Akshat Verma</a></p>
