<h1 class="page-title">Anubhav Kapoor</h1><p>There is never a dull moment when he is around. He is fun loving and full of life. He is intelligent and passionate about things that excite him,be it some academic course or diligently heading out of the campus to have fun! Good food excites him and he savours the taste of his favourite dish to the fullest as a result he is always the last person to get up from the dining table. He is stylish,smart and confident. He hardly gets worked up over trying situations and is one of the coolest person to hang out with.I particularly remember the passion with which he played in the hostel cricket league and apparently 'injured' himself while giving it his all! I have shared some great moments with him and hope to spend many more. cheers mate! wish you all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>

<p>I remember Anubhav from the first year. We talked a little, and I knew of him as a jovial fellow, who you could count on for a smile. I had the pleasure of working with him in the second year, for a group presentation: and I daresay it turned out well for the both of us! And then, there was the third year, when we really bonded, and I found myself face to face with all that ambition, all that energy and all that joy of life, smiling back at me for everything that I am worth. I liked it. In him, I found someone with the ability to appreciate things that most others would condemn. I found a bridge from my world of solitary existence to the outer realm of truly social being. I can't thank him enough for it, but that's alright, for he won't ever ask. We aren't exactly separating now, but yes, that day shall come to. With that in mind, I shall express to him all the fondness I have in my heart for him, and and look upon myself with pride, for having known a man, who went on and did great things. It is a pleasure to know you, Anubhav. Walk your path, Anubhav, walk your pathâ€¦ run like a hero in victory!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tuhin-sah">Tuhin Sah</a></p>
