title: Anubhav Sapra

<h1 class="page-title">Anubhav Sapra</h1><p>Sapresh as I like to call him, is one of the first guys I met on campus. With a pleasant personality and a helpful nature, he is our very own Good Guy Greg. This 'Haryaanvi' from 'Panchkula' is extremely amiable and practically knows everyone on campus first-hand. The one thing I love about this person is his willingness to learn and how much interest he shows in every single sphere of knowledge.
A great guy to hangout with an ever-dependable person, it has been my pleasure spending 3 years in the same corridor :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Sapra is your suave Chandigarh puttar, complete with the love for food, drink and women. Sapra loves his cricket, and he's suggested some of the better documentaries that I have seen. He takes jokes very sportingly, and can be a force to reckon with if you tick him off. His knowledge of cricket is encyclopedic, and he is also passionate about any kind of physical activity, be it football, trekking or well, ahem. Never the kind of guy to miss out on a hearty breakfast or a long drive. I'm sure he'll do well in whatever he pursues later in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Sapra, Sapre, Sapru etc. A man with many names to begin with. We met the very first time at cricket selections in 1-1, where he stood out as one of the better pacers in contention for a spot. Injuries and other reasons did not let him make most of a promising college cricket career, and even 20 years down the line I'd tell him that he was stupid not to come back for selection the following years. On a non-cricket front, Sapra is the kinda guy who people will like instantly. He just takes everything in his stride, be it of any nature, and he's always optimistic about things. A guy with a big heart, and a closet romantic i guess, he's fun to around with. I wish him luck for the future, and I'm sure he'll succeed in his endeavours in the coming years.

<p>Sapru....my betting buddy!!!! I had an awesome time betting on Cricket matches with you (even though you won the biggest won, u lost most of them :P) Frankly speaking, the first time I saw you in our corridor, you seemed those arrogant types, but it's only after I got to know you well that I realized how wrong I was!!!! You are a really cool person to hang out with and very warm-hearted. Your Cricket and football skills are simply awesome (I will never forget your direct throw from the deep to affect a runout in Slam)!!!! Hope you have a great life ahead and hope we stay in touch after BITS too!!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Sapru! Got to know him properly only in the 3rd year :(. And what great company he's been! He's an avid cricket fan and a very good cricketer himself. Also a good futsal keeper! I'll always remember those late night futsal sessions we've had in this semester.An ardent Liverpool fan(one of those rare ones :P) staying put in the common room, Liverpool's miserable performances notwithstanding! All that apart, one thing that I like the most about him is that he has a heart of gold. Without a doubt one of the nicest people I've ever met :)
Wish you the very best in life.Be as you are and DO stay in touch!
Cheers.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>

<p>Sapre..kaisa hai..This guy has a pure heart and his talk reflects honesty..I have always enjoyed his company..a very sportive banda who will never pass you by without a cheerful greeting..Probably a cricket fan at first he switched over to football recently and after a long time of pondering over which club to support he finally settled on liverpool!(can you believe it?)..A true Punjabi?/Hariyanvi?(i could never make out the difference between the two) he loves to party and have fun..Cheers man..Do keep in touch..!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>
<p>Cricket is a fantastic sport and I  love it all the more because it introduced me to Sapra... one of the best bowlers of BITS goa  but unfortunately BITS never got to see much of him, reasons known only to sapru..... a fantastic guy to start with, Sapra is really honest, humble, polite and one of the nicest people on campus I have ever known.... never fails to return a smile whenevr we see each other, ur company has been truly amazing!!!!!! wishing you success in all your future endeavors..... may our paths cross many a times in future!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Sapruu! I don't think i've ever used his first name in these 2 odd years that i've known Sapra. I'm glad that i did meet sapra, even though i met him fairly late on in my BITS life. He's been one of my closest friends since i've met the lad. He's one of the nicest and most genuine people i know. A scapegoat in many situations, i can always count on Sapra to take  the fun being poked at him the right way and i really admire him for being able to do that. He's the quintessential nice guy. Gossip hungry and eloquent, Sapra is real fun to have any sort of conversation with and I'm really going to miss having those conversations with this man from Panchkula. Sapru, this friendship still has a long way to go!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>

<p>Sapre ! Sapru or whatever weird names he has, people just dont call him Anubhav for some reason. This Punjabi munda is awesome to hang out with be it watching Chelsea play or Liverpool lose. A cool estud who loves talking on general topics, does know a lot about Liverpool its history and shit. I dint get to hang out with you often, but the time spend was seriously awesome. Be it cribbing about ENI or talking bullshit about Indian Politics or sad performance by Chelsea or Liverpool, he just knows how to debate. He is one of those guys whom I admire for their personality and their calmness. I dont know why but this chap dint play cricket for the team ever, he is one of the best bowlers who can keep well, man dedication failure :P. His company is awesome and that shall be duely missed, and the bitter truth he lacks common sense and pretends he as if he has it. 
In all, a fantastic cool headed estud from that hindi tv serial walla place - Panchkula, who is damn emotional shall be missed in this campus. 
I hope you achieve greater heights in your life, succeed and learn that Liverpool has no future now.
Have a great life man !

PS. Take a job near Mumbai - Pune - Bangalore , I want to see more matches with you !  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Sapru yaani 'Chaud'. At first glance hes this stereotypical with Haryanvi with the attitude and the build to go with it, but as you get to know him further, he comes out to be this really genuine and sociable guy. May it be the football, cricket or politics Sapru will always have a word or two to say, his knowledge and interest in these are admirable. A budding right back in football, hes also an excellent cricketer and a table tennis player. Hes one of those guys who can take banter in the right spirit, also he can take virtually anyone's case within seconds (often unintentionally). Sapru is also a fellow foodie, butter chicken being the obvious favourite, with a taste for good liquer.  Sapru has always been awesome company,  and this Panchkula lad will be missed dearly. Until next time then. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Sapra/ sapru/ ok let it be :P . Its been my fortune that Sapra has been one of the very first people I befriended in campus and I'm proud of it! Ive spent some wonderful times with this guy and trust me he is just awesome! Our one to one convos and that too in the special language that we have devised are something I really cherish. A keen observer and a knowledgeable guy, sapra is a really genuine friend and well wisher. Whatever he thinks about you, he will have it on his face, whether you like it or not! Perhaps that's why the name 'chaud' :P ( Also in this context, he would say " like I  keare" :P) Being friends with sapra has been amazing. He is one person i can bank on, no matter what!  Hope our friendship stays for ever! (And whenever you wanna play football.. Ghar aa jaana!! :P) I wish you all the very best for your future. Cheers! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/hemant-bhatt">Hemant Bhatt</a></p>
<p>The realm of sapra! . Wonder when was the last time when someone called you from your first name. Really awesome guy to be with. Though i knew you from the first year itself go to know you better in the 3rd year and i was not at all disappointed. This is one guy who is in good terms with almost everybody!! Now i don't want to sound gay but one can take a liking for him almost in the first meet. He is a good friend , an awesome cricket player ( don't know why you left that). He is one of the few liverpool supporters in our hostel. Kabhi bhi kick volleyball khelna ho ya futsal sapra ko bula lo, exam ho ya nahi this guy will surely come. 'Chaud' suits his persona( though it is overrated at times :P) It's been a pleasure knowing you. stay in touch and ' chaudte raho'<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>When I saw sapra first, he looked like a gangster. I wasn't very keen on getting to know him. But sapra turned out to be football fan. We ended up going for bogmalo trips together and discussing about football. We even ended up playing futsal for AH4 together.Sapra unlike his looks is a very sweet and cool guy. He's good at heart and is willing to help anyone in need. Had some great times together.Kickvolley ball, futsal, bogmalo trips, AFC Cup  etc.Will miss you. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Sapra is pro. Sapru, is one of the very few Punjabis who I have immense respect for. Very genuine, sensible, and easy-going, Sapra's antics have led him to be the official scapegoat at every instant in time, but he's always taken it with a smile, and that characteristic smile and shoulder-shrug. All the times at Bogmalo have been fun  because of his mere presence. Good luck with everything Sapru. Here's to all the chaud-ness,and  the 'breakfast' sessions. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Sapra is one awesome fellow to hang out with.Be it at Bogmalo, the cricket field or the common room, Sapra's presence is fun indeed. Sapra is a Sports buff, liverpool being his favourite club. A really good fast bowler, its a loss for the cricket team that Sapra wasn't a part. He has this "chaud" that he's from Chandigrah (:P), never mind. He is also a budding right back and one of the promising footballers of the future. Sapra, its been a pleasure knowing you and spending 3 years together. Best of luck for you future endeavours.
PS: He loves eating breakfast at Pleasure Pie.   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
<p>Anubhav Sapra is genuinely helpful and understanding person. He is well composed. Sapra defines "chaud" in true sense. He is very responsible guy (that calculator incident). We have never been on outing together. He has been a very good neighbor all these years. He is a very good futsal player. His logical thinking and his attitude will take him to heights. All the Best man!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
