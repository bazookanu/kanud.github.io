<h1 class="page-title">Anudeep Bodireddy</h1><p>I really don' know what is the reference to "Kya" or "bodi" but it all kind of sounds cool as he is. Yet another "PRO" CS player and a gentleman. Never forgets to say hi or a friendly chat every time we pass by.I really doubt if "$toN3d" nick suits him :P but he has been a great guy.May you have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>Bodi or "$toN3d" as he is called is the perfect example of a tough looking soft guy...One of the few guys who actually speak whats in their head...Dude i still remember the day we had our first beer(should i say we becoz u wer puking at that time :P)...But it had been a crazy journey from then on....Whatever crazy shit i could think of he would be there doing that right on the spot....But under all this craziness there is a real sensitive person(who doesnt come out often though)....I still remember his weird CS niks though like "kya?" and shit but man he is a damn good shooter.....Btw dont believe him when he says he is not a nerd he is one (Nerd Alert!).....In short he is like a complete package(gaming,studies,etc.).....Its been great spending a blissful 4 years wid u and wishing for even more :D ! I am sure we would have more of those "high" times on the roof :P :D ! !----Rithin
P.S---Dude u really should start wearing undies...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rithin-chandra-jampala">Rithin Chandra Jampala</a></p>
<p>Bodi...!!!!One more guy from our KKR college...He is an awesome,fun loving guy who always loves to help others...He is also a member of our CS clan...In the beginning actually we played in opposite clans,but ended up being in the same clan...It's an awesome experience to play CS with him....By the way he ""was"" an AK47 pro and he terrified the whole CS world of our college with his head shots..._/\_..There is no CS player in our campus who doesn't know $toN3d...He always comes to my room for studying,but we both end up the day by playing CS....He is ecstatic towards CS and psychotic in studies..I still remember how he cried the whole month because he missed a surprize quiz...I'll never forget those nightouts we have done with him during compre exams(Mt2,Es2 and Spm especially :D :P)..ohhh and he also the brand ambassador of bogmallo :D...I'll never forget you and thank God he has given me a friend like you....With Love------------------------------------Surya<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rayala-surya-teja">Rayala Surya Teja</a></p>
