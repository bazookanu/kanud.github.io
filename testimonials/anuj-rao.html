<h1 class="page-title">Anuj Rao</h1><p>From that first journey to Vasco (you, me and pranay) to that ragging in AH6, every time i got to know you a little better. You have a unique sense of humor, a strong determination and full dedication to your goals. And are still very helpful and caring, the way you stood by me during my short trip to SMRC :P is something i will never forget and m very grateful to you for that. You are passionate for a lot of things in your own way. Though i wouldn't count cleanliness amongst your passions and your room is an excellent example of that. We will soon be starting our last stint of the college in a new hostel where the relative locations of our room is slightly altered but nevertheless we will still have all the fun and even more as its gonna be the last year on campus. Luking forward to one more awesome year with you guys mate. All the best for your future plans. Good Luck :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>One of the first people i knew on campus. One thing about this guy is- Nothing can ever go wrong with him ever. He always has all his things spot-on. A highly intelligent, smart, cheerful, hardworking and helpful is how I would describe him. He is extremely smart when it comes to managing his academics with his other activities. He has high concentration levels and gives his complete dedication to whatever he does. He is always aware about the things around him and makes the best use of them. Sometimes he might go bit too far while making fun of others but will always be there when you need help. We have had a number of great outings together from the epic Mangalore one to Curlies nightouts as well as the tiny ones just outside the campus. I guess the biggest one is still pending...dhoondle yaar gadi kidhar se toh! I am sure I have missed out on mentioning many more things..
I have no doubt that you are going to have a great future...All the very best man!

<p>Anuj Rao a.k.a anju/juju or anjannaa !!
He is one of the most hard-working people I know. He is extremely smart, and exceptionally good at mimicry and telling anecdotes. Usually he is that careless chap, who roams around in borrowed slippers, playing under-arm cricket/football/late night card games/fifa, making fun (all in good humour, no harm) of anyone in sight, listening rock, and accompanying aks in finishing those reality tv-shows. However, in comes the week before exam and bam ! He's a totally different person. Extremely hard-working, focused and (pardon me) nerdy during the exams. But that precisely is the quality that I admire in him. He balances his time extremely well. He compartmentalizes it very well. He knows when to focus on academics and when to focus on other chudaapas. Oh, and he also happens to be one of the biggest tharki that I know ;).
<p><p>
Here's a toast to that epic Mangalore/Jog trip, to the Curlies', to the bog jaunts, to that weird oouu greeting, to those awesome songs you always suggest, and to all the anecdotes that you make umpteen times funnier than they really are. Cheers !! 
<p><p>
P.S : Next trip kab hai ? To the Bog/Jog !!

<p>A cool guy for most part of the semester, roams around the hostel playing cricket or fifa (extremely good at both of these), mimics everyone in the hostel. But during the last week of any semester, one can find him outside his room. Extremely humble but one cant take his words at face value.... I remember him saying "Abe mere se padh ke nahi ho raha, mein li8 le raha hoon" before compre but got a gpa of 9"..... even during our cop, he did my work also leaving me tension free...  just one outing to bogmalo with him and that was my best outing ever. You are one of the few who take pains to clean the room... that too regularly. During our last stint of college, I would miss you as our new hostels are on opposite corners of the campus and would miss you further after that. Have a great future ahead ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Anuj.........if i had to choose to name one person who lives life to the fullest, then it has to be this guy........some one who actually follows the ‘ work hard, party harder’ dictum........he is the one who gave me the name ‘chotu’ (inspite of me being taller and older than him :P)...........a super smart and an exceptionally hard working person........if there is anyone from whom you should be hearing anecdotes or funny incidents, then it is this guy...........i have tonnes of memories with anuj which im gonna cherish forever, be it playing fifa endlessly on his lappy for days on end or making fun of laxman and kicking his ass :P or even  those awesome discussions on reality shows that we have after watching every episode :D or even all those days we’ve spent only playing cricket............i never see him open a book even 2 weeks before the exams but afterwards the dedication with which he studies for that 1 or 2 weeks is mind-blowing and admirable............he actually never fails in whatever task he takes up and that is what i like the best in him..........always at the forefront to plan outings and nite-outs...........i can actually go on and on about him but im stopping now (padhna hai :P)............looking forward to another eventful year of cdc’s with you and i hope your hardworking attitude rubs of me then........all the best for your future!!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-verenkar">Akshay Verenkar</a></p>
