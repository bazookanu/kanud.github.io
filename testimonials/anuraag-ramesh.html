<h1 class="page-title">Anuraag Ramesh</h1><p>I always knew him as the cool kid at the end of the corridor..
Then came PS1-and damn!!--Anurag is THE best dancer i have ever seen. Cool,calm, always ready to have some fun. Talking with Anurag and Kedar is the exam hall just before the exam- something i will never forget-- it has now become a routine!-- But most of all, I thank Anurag for introducing me to "Diary of a wimpy kid"..All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Anuraag - The most humble guy on campus. I came to know him during my PS1. He is one of the best dancers on campus. He is cool, calm and a fun guy. But I should mention his road sense is amazing :P :P. Be always the way you are and keep rocking. All the Best!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Our very own OOOnoooo!
In true mechanical engineering style, I say that this guy has a ridiculous strength to weight ratio. And while he is sometimes prone to make startling noises (aaaahhh), he is driven by a gem of a brain. He is smart, dances really well and beats the stuffing out of Jayant in Split Second.
All the best for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>A piece of genius no one has ever seen. Never attended a single class, still ends up being av+ 20 in all the tests. Wonder how he manages his studies (consistent), his dance club (an awesome coordinator) and his3 (you know what i mean). A wonderful guy, always ready to help, i am sure he will have a wonderful life and will reach great heights. I think he should improve his sense of directions. He is terrible remembering places. Good Luck!!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Anuraag and I used to challenge each other on every little thing, in our first year, like who has a better CG, or who will get a girlfriend first. I backed out of most of these bets a few semesters later but this guy sadistically kept on winning all of them. Apart from that personality defect, he’s a great all-rounder: dancer, tabla player, TT champ and still gets good marks and STILL is not at all boring, which is quite remarkable. He’s generally very nice, but if you ask for it he won’t hesitate to give it to you and make you cry.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>This is one awesome guy. Very talented, smart, and above all things, a very warm person. U are a brilliantly versatile dancer, a really down to earth person and an awesome co-ordinator. And like me, u mentally correct grammatical errors as people speak :P I will always remember u especially during the Hyderabad and Calicut trips. Its always been a pleasure talking to you, and i mean it. You have an awesome sense of humour, both of you infact...I cant get bored with you and Mythri around! :P ohh and yes, most importantly we have the same taste in food and when I look back to remember you im sure i will remember us playing ATLAS :D
Always stay this way, and I'm sure it will get you a long way in life! Do keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tara-ramanan">Tara Ramanan</a></p>
<p>One of the most straight headed people I know . Good in acads , awesome dancer and a great TT player . Remember the zephyr 2010 days * nostalgia * . The TT table in the hostel actually belongs to Anurag rather than AH3 . You can spot him time and again firing shots on the table . I know you;ll make big :) Cheers !! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>

<p>Anuraag is a cool and calm person. He is very soft spoken and humble. He is one of the best dancers I have ever seen. He is a great TT player. I know him since my second year when we did MED together. I got to know him more during PS1. He was my project partner during our PS 1 at SKF, Pune. Together we have broken hundreds of SKF bearings to improve the channel efficiency! Everyday we used to disassemble bearings. PS-1 would not have been so much fun without him-we had a lot of fun playing TT at he SKF recreation centre. I remember the day when we missed the SKF bus and had to wait until the next shift got over. That day we had explored the SKF north and south colony. We also went cycling around the whole SKF campus. It was fun watching Delhi Belly when we were supposed to be working on the channel. Our PS 1 project would not have been a great success without him! Special thanks to Gaurav Mittal too! I wish Anuraag all the best for his future! May you succeed in whatever you chhose to do!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>Anuraag is the kind of guy who challenges convention. And he does manage to break it and be successful. Its like, "Anuraag, you shouldnt wear a Quark tee and shorts when going on a date", and he says "Why not!" "Anuraag, maybe you'll want to wear a full-shirt under the suit." His reply, "Abhi kisiko maloom thodi padega." And he does always get away with it. I wish you all the best and may your winning streak continue.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jayant-dalmia">Jayant Dalmia</a></p>

<p>Anuraag is one of the nicest neighbour and friend one could have. The guy with the golden image who has it for good reason, smart, nice dancer, tt player, helpful, hitler co-di  bla bla bla :D. Best remembered for his common room and lead role in one of the most popular videos on campus.
Always there if you need him (quite often). Always has his feet planted on the ground. Though I insist he needs to get out more often. The amount of name calling, jackassery and fun that we've done has made engineering much more tolerable. It's been an honor. Best of luck for the future, of course we are going to keep in touch. Kick some butt.

<p>Well we both are in Mechanical, we had the same classes and he is my neighbor, so it was obvious that we would be good friends. We actually owned  the TT table in our common room. How can I forget the moans, the birthday decorations, the campus-ebay chudaap, the antichess matches, watching you guys play Split Second etc. Its been one hell of an experience here and he was a part of most them. I wont mention about his acads and dance, not because he not got at it, but because there is so much more to this wonderful person. All the best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kedar-deshmukh">KEDAR DESHMUKH</a></p>
