<p>I had  to reciprocate my love to you(after u invented "Bellu") ,So lo and Behold --Dandu  was born.Remeber the line:"Dandu hai tu" (Parth and fish used to use it repeatedly) ... :D .. A face of an innocent baby and the those curly entangled hairs ( I remember my hand being stuck once... :D) now known as "The Helmet". dont be fooled....Dandu is a godlike  sportperson (watching u play TT was a  privilege ..) , has a penchant for current affairs(always reading news ),a  really good singer and the best whistler I have known. Have really fond memories with u ...Be it ogling at girls in the mess ...or watching friends on u r lappy...and the night out this sem...( Ur driving gave me goosebumps at times... but what fun we had...\m/...)...And I must specially mention..Of all the people who have pulled my cheeks ..U were by far the gentlest..  :D .. I feel really sad these 3 wonderful years have come to an end.... All the best and have a joyous fun filled life... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>Anurag is a very calm, easy going and hard working person. He is a really good sportsman. Him ,Vardhan, and the gang always have legendary night-outs, though I have heard of them indirectly. He is a great friend, and a simple and nice person. Nice to have you as a friend, Dandya! All the best!! Wish you a successful future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Anurag' (although iv hardly ever called him by that name on campus) , is my regular companion during journeys between Mumbai and Goa.  Travelling is never boring when he is around. 
He is the epitome of patience. He takes anything at all thrown his way, with a smile. He never lets people around him realize when he is distressed. He awesomely controls his emotions be it of extreme happiness or sorrow. These are qualities which are not really common  and this is exactly what makes him so special among all of us. Dandu is mature, hardworking, calm, and fun-loving, but at times is lazy and absent-minded (which is very amusing at times). He has got unique sense of humor, which is predictable yet funny.  He is a gifted sportsman with superb abilities in football and table-tennis. He is the first person i turn to, if i want to ever go out of campus ;) Hardly ever says 'no' for answer.  My trip to his home in Alibagh, was superb fun. There I rode a bike for the first time ever, and he was my pillion.  
His caring and kind nature is hard to hate. He was a part of almost every memorable incident i have had on campus. All the best and cheers for life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuj-rao">Anuj Rao</a></p>
<p>Danduu!!! A very soft spoken, polite and  chilled out person, A die-hard Arsenal fan and a very good football player. Playing football with you has always been fun. He is also a very good T.T. player(mostly from what I've heard). Watching Ali make Velino jokes on you and you taking it so sportingly has always been great to watch. All the best for you future endeavors. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>

<p>Danduuuu…..bhai tune jitni help ki h ….i’ll always be thankful for that…..be it the reports…..syllabus….or even the doubts. I know him from the very first sem but we started interacting mainly in 3-1 ……remember….. every other day we used to meet in bogmallo :P :P. He is a very good T.T. player and very kind by nature. He always looks serious but he is the lightest person earth. Wish u all the happiness and success in life bro :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anchit-saini">Anchit Saini</a></p>

<p>Anurag Dandekar a.k.a dandu/dandoos is a humid, pre-possessing homosapien with full-sized aortic pumps. In other words he is a nice, warm person with a big heart. He has a very calm, composed, amicable and happy-go-lucky  He is an awesome footballer, unfortunately a Gunner but also a former state level TT player. He is always well-informed about latest news around the world. He is unpretentious but loves sporting that damned helmet of his :). He is also a national-level seetibaaz ;). If you haven't heard him whistle the most complex of songs nonchalantly, you are definitely missing something incredible. He also happens to be a li'l absent minded, and appears seriously confounded at times(that lock incident, rofl :D). However, you just can't help but smile everytime you meet this guy. Whoa, there have been a great number of moments and experiences to relish !! Memories of the past 3 years come flooding back faster than I can phrase sentence for any one of them. Off the top of my head, the trip to jog falls was epic, but the journey back was toh legendary ;).Huge fan of bike ride and trips, he has been a partner on almost all the bike rides I have had in Goa. He has been a perpetual comrade in all those futsal/football matches since before the dawn of time. His knack of forgetting something and then suddenly remembering it minutes later has given quite a number of hilarious moments. His god-awful pjs (matched only by <a href="http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/76"> Varun </a>), have been another source of good laughter. He is also credited with probably the "<b><i>best</b></i>" joke ever cracked on BITS-Pilani, K.K Birla, Goa Campus (remember Shafqat :P).
<p><p>
Here's a toast to the epic journey these 3 years have been, to that Jog journey, to that restaurent before Mangalore, to all those times I selfishly did not pass the football, to all those times you mis-locked, to the \m/ bog jaunts, to the Curlies', to our quartet of Friends' 5+ timers viz. le helmet guy, le me, le <a href="http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/76"> Mr. too cool</a>, and le <a href="http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/660"> Mr. lite </a>, and of course to your helmet :D. You have been an awesome friend. Always stay in touch :). 
<p><p>
P.S : There will always be time for an episode of friends, or a football/futsal match, or a drink with an old pal. You are always welcome with that darned helmet of yours :D.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
<p>Anurag, a caring,simple and down-to- earth person........he is one guy with whom you cannot have a dull time.........his sense of humour is really awesome what with him always trying to crack Pjs :P and also  with his god-like comments ( remember on fb post ‘shaitaan’:P)..............although many times the joke is on him:P,.........his best quality is that he takes it all sportingly ?.............an epic football lover............his dedication towards football is just admirable and the way he plays it is even more praiseworthy.........a die hard ARSENAL fan.........never the one to miss out any of their matches...........his knowledge of the game is too superb........... everytime i have been in his room in the last 3 years, i have always found him reading goal.com...........watches lots of tv series so much so that to aviod them during the exams, he goes to the lib :P............quite a hardworking and chilled out person.........just be the way you are always :)...........all the best for your future!!!!!!

<p>daandooooooo.... One of a kind person. Though i know plenty of them in our hostel but dandu, you have been simply outstanding. Your sastas, incredibly terrific. You are as down to earth as anyone can be, its really very difficult to tell that you sometimes are actually tensed  because of that single expressioned face of yours. The only two expressions i know is "dandu laughing" and "dandu not laughing" :P ..... Well enough of the leg pulling. It was great knowing you mate. You are always fun and its great to hangout with you. Every time spend with you was thoroughly enjoyed. Wish you all the best for your future and hopefully you will find your someone special soon :P. And not to forget about your skills with football and table tennis. Most of the people have already written about how good you are in sports so i will just cut it short. Best wishes dandoo and to your trademark helmet as well. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>I met Dandu through football. That's how i met half the people i know on campus. But Dandu stood out from among the rest of the other people I played football with. He's a very calm and sensible player. Had fun winning BPL 2010 together. Off the pitch Dandu's a great guy. Good at heart and helpful. Was good to have him a mech buddy. Hope we'll end up in the same PS. All the best for you future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Anurag Dandekar lost his identity to “Dandu” and his “helmet”,  as he came to BITS.. :D. He is a person with ultimate sense of humour... especially the witty one liners :D!! He is very soft hearted, hard working and a very good gamer as well... he is the man who will always stand by u (even if he doesn’t know y he is standing for.. :P). He is always self content and happy with what he is!! He doesn’t care what others think of him.. but he is sensitive at times.. one more thing i forgot to mention, he is “confused” (most of the time.. :P ;) jus kidding :D). He is a great footballer, its really a pleasure to watch his play n tricks.. (actually he is the one who inspired me to follow football.. ;)) he is baap of TT (i really wanna have some of ur talent man!!). he is perfect example of humble, caring, down-to-earth, self-confident as well as self satisfied person. I sheer pleasure to have any meal with him... (mostly in C mess.. :P). He is very polite person, never saw him indulging into any kind of fights or have any grudges, a very socialistic man. I hope u remain the way u r.... really gonna miss all those bakwaas n all the laughter we shared.. thanx for everything..  best luck for ur future. Keep in touch!! :) n one more thing people... believe me, he doesnt lock his neighbors door n go to classes... ;) :P :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nilesh-bhala">Nilesh Bhala</a></p>
<p>Writing this testimonial will be so hard, because i just dont know where to start !! Well we argue over when we first met, he says we met in a lecture hall which is highly improbable because we both do not venture towards the classrooms, n i say we met in the common room while playing carrom, this is more believable !!
They say, " Kyun, Alibag se ayela hai kya ?? " Well Dandu sach mein Alibag se ayela hai !!
I do not recall anyone calling him Anurag. He is either dandu or helmet to everyone !! He is a gifted footballer. He has an amazing game sense. He is a fan of Arsenal (me too), a true gunner. He is an amazing entertainer. He has a bottomless reservoir of saste jokes. And the timing with which he delivers them is impeccable. He is the most mature person out of the group. He can keep his head cool even when all around him are freaking out. It is with this thoughtfulness that he takes his decisions and they turn out right. He has a sense of responsibility and a bearing to work for his goals. He is interested in economics and I would suggest him to pursue a degree in that field. He is always aware of the events going around the globe. Reading the newspaper was a valuable habit that he inculcated in me.
Dandya is more than a friend to me. He is like my brother. We have always been side by side during every exam that we gave in BITS. We have always boosted each other. It was like a partnership during exams :). We have talked about so many things, mostly meaningless, but still !! We have spent so much time together on and off campus. We share so many enthralling memories.
I am gonna miss u sorely, man !! I am sure u will go a long way through our life. U are going to make it grand one day !! Hope we will rejoice it together. Cheers !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vardhan-thakar">Vardhan Thakar</a></p>
