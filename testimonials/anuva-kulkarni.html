<p>Always draped in some royal fantasy, this intelligent, smart and simple girl is one of the best friends I have here in BITS. She carries around herself a calm demeanor which totally reflects in her all actions. Determined as she is,she achieves every goal that has been set for her with almost clinical precision. And her total humble and modest attitude in the face of these achievements is what sets her apart. Her mastery over the language and her excellence in writing short stories is unparalleled. Eventhough being a total genius in academics she is passionate about her hobbies. And then I can't help mentioning the small calculated smile with which she sums up every episode and moves on towards the next.. One of my most trustworthy friends. Hope you continue being successful in everything that you try and keep smiling always :) - HC<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshal-chaudhari">Harshal Chaudhari</a></p>

<p>When I saw Anuva first time in campus (somewhere near shop-co), I only knew she is from FC (Fergusson College). Came to know her after quite some time due to MM. She is very soft-spoken, calm and always with a mild smile on her face… :) She had never travelled by bus (long journey) before coming to BITS (!! :P) The 005 is very sincere to whatever she does. A EEE phodu… hardworking girl… And a sweet friend! Wish you all the best for your life ahead! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Ohh.. where do I begin..!! Miss Marauder says it all... one of those people who have a "cool" email id.. Thats what they think :P... A pretty silent person she is.. Humility personified...!!! Doing her own things in her own way... "Shantit Kranti" is one apt marathi phrase to describe this person.... :P.. An extremely hard working person who never wastes her opportunities... EXPLOITS them big time...One of those people who have had an excellent academic career... (So .. pretty much a NERD :P... )... A wannabe BRITISH girl... Always fantasises about being British and living in those old castle-like houses with that kind of British respect and honour... One of those who has probably travelled a lot around the globe... Been to US, England blah blah.. (Forgot the rest.. There are so many.. :D) But prefers to go to London again and again... !! A HUGE HARRY POTTER FAN... NO ONE ELSE CAN BEAT HER... Even those books of hers would have been bugged by being read again and again... Has a crazy affection towards books... You always find her reading something or the other.. No wonder the mastery over the language that she has... Her love for electronics is truly unbounded and so is her hate for electrical stuff... A very very very sincere person... First-bench-takes-down-notes types people.. How would I forget the PPL... THE PPL (Physics Project Lab) We were together on a project... ;)... Also would means like to mention "the means the **** ( :P ) the means... :P".. Awesome time there.. with counting the means...His mails that he sent .. Totally hilarious.. :P .. I-can-chat-anytime attitude with anyone makes her really stand out.. Goes on and on and on with anyone ...Ohh .. how can I forget that we happent to give the GRE on the same day.. :P. A true example of hard work and sincerity paying off.. :) Keep it up.. Ashich raha.. Thanks for being such a wonderful fun-to-be-with friend.. and giving this lifelong friendship to cherish... Wish you all the best for the future... :P (especially your MS) PS : See you at GRE.. :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>Nerdy. Silent. Self-sufficient. and yet one of the most wonderful people ive met on this campus! she takes her time, but once you get to know her, she'll open up to you.
She was of course the first victim of the 'bird' back in PS1. :-P
since then shes been a wonderful friend and there in times of need ( the only one who knew my gmail password yet!) She's forever online and if u dint know better you'd think she was totally vela. 
And yet in all this chaos she's focussed, dedicated and striven to working hard.
Anuva-hope you the best in life! We gonna meet a lot aage jaake u watch!
Just remember though, I can't always do your COP for you the next time :-P

<p>She's one of the most calm and composed persons I've come across. Intelligent and the scene isn't what it seems is like :D We had our PS-1 together and I must say, that was the best summer I had ! Time flew away in a jiffy thanks to the awesome company of hers and the rest. It was awesome troubling her with the 'Bird' song :D Anuva, I'm still so mad at you for cancelling the trip that day. Totally your fault ! :P She was probably the only person who worked so sincerely with dedication in PS1. It was fun sharing SOTDs with you and having the samosas in the after the lunch. MI4 in Hindi :D (thank me) No point in talking about her intellectual prowess. Everyone knows about it. I'd rather say that she's an awesome friend to be with. Had a great time with you always. Be it PS or the treats :D Wish you a very wonderful and bright future and always remember the word. You know the word right ? :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>I met her on my first day in campus and I knew that my new neighbor was so much like me.. no wonder we got along well. I soon came to know more about her. She is a gifted writer and appreciates good poetry and literature. She is sensitive and sensible and also a pretty good artist.. i had seen some of her drawings in the first year. We share a lot of common likes (especially Marathi songs :) ) and dislikes.The only way she is totally different from me is her obsession with the British. She loves books and these days she is especially into reading about Queen Elizabeth. Harry Potter is her Life, God knows how many times she has read it.. she remembers every character and every event so vividly. She is a wonderful person, extremely simple, down to earth, hard working and dedicated to her work and one person who I love to share the corridor with :) . 
Best wishes for your future....   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nisheeta-desai">Nisheeta Desai</a></p>
<p>Until last sem, i only knew you by name and face. We never really talked to each other. I can say i only met you this sem in analog lab. Honestly, I wasn't sure how well we'd along. But boy did we get along! Anuva you are the best lab partner ever!!! I could very conveniently rely on you to read all the color codes correctly!! ;P I had so much fun in analog labs with you. Remember how we'd compete against time to keep our record of finishing by 4'O clock? (Although we broke our record in the last few labs). And how we'd fool Jyothsna in thinking our output was right when in fact it was waay off the mark :D I very happy i found such a good friend. I regret not having met you before.
I'll definitely keep in touch <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/lasya-boddapati">Lasya Boddapati</a></p>
<p>She was my mate in my CDC year. Too good at studies. Likes to play Badminton with me :P.. I like her because we cried together for our CDCs, labs and marks (Also teachers :P) in our third year. Though over all she is a quite person. Calm during a problem. We have had fun solving cadence assignment together. You would find us around each other’s room during crisis times like assignment submissions…Lab exams… :P  She was the one who introduced me to IEEE for the first time and has been with me in it since then ?. Very sincere in her work. Nothing is very tough for her. She introduced me to the new ice cream “sachha aam” It’s a good one..i suggest everybody should try it once.. :P It would be very different for me to turn my face around and not have you in classes next time I come back.. Stay around.. You ll surely succeed in whatever you choose to do in d coming years.. I wish the best for you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khayali-jain">Khayali Jain</a></p>
<p>One of my closest friends in EEE whose friendship I will cherish always. Soft spoken, kindhearted, hard working and completely dedicated and sincere to whatever she does. It has become a habit for me to run to your room, whenever I am stuck with any doubts in any of our common subjects. One can always count on her to get all the submission dates and deadlines right!!! She plans out everything in detail and is completely focused on getting things done. A very good friend who is always ready to help you out. Together we have spend time trying to crack our EEE CDC doubts, IEEE project, moaning about the assignment submissions and exams which always lay dangerously close and a bit of gossip here and there. :P.  I am going to miss you a lot. I am sure you'll have a great life ahead. All the Best. :)

<p>Fanu! As I fondly call out to her everytime I spot her here and there.  One of the closest persons to me on campus. We have had innumerable fun moments – from the ‘Funini’ moments to the ‘Fast-&-the-Fourier’ moments and the ‘OMG-she-is-bending-to-pick-up-the-chalk’ moments (!!) were amongst the most memorable ones. She is one being who shares the same keen interest in tennis as me. We have had multiple debates to discuss Nadal-Fed rivalry. The 3am snack with Lays and Coke justifies that pretty much. We have had several fun moments playing tennis on the dilapidated courts of our campus (err... or 1-2 shot rallies for that matter), and even more funner moments searching for the fluorescent balls in the thickets. Her living on the ground floor when we all were here on the top floor is a regret that I have voiced out multiple times to her! I have had amazing times with her in SPM class also (haha! ) But CAS  tops it all! :D We have had Vocal -Creativity at its best during those times :D. We have shared classy and mad songs. French and Japanese songs. Mutilated existing songs; and what not over gtalk. We have shared links of elite apparel websites and crazy-stuff-to-check-out-on-the-net sites. And after all this, it is still fun whenever we do it. I admire the way she remains to be well mannered at all times. Poised. All-ladylike. Mature. Well Behaved. Keep it up Fanu! Stay the same.
Have to say this now ?
“You know you love me – XOXO”
