<h1 class="page-title">Apoorv Bhardwaj</h1><p>*AB* as we call him s d most caring, full of energy & jovial guys around who is always high about doing anything . deceptively innocent bt is really sly n cunning. I remember d 1st time i met him he was so ecstatic. I wonder how life wd had been without him. The 1st guy I met in d campus. Cheers 2 those amazing memories, nite outs, *trips*, laughs. A true Punjabi who openly expresses his thoughts, has a firm opinion and a bold outlook towards life. I love you AB..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikunj-sharma">Nikunj Sharma</a></p>
<p>Apoorv is wat i call him n AB is wat he calls himself !! Self obsessed i tell u :D He is one boy ( oops i shud call him 'the man' ) obsessed with stupid little things lik competing with girls for likes on his DP on facebook! True punjabi..n yea..a typical north indian attitude n also a racist! Doesn know how 2 pronounce dosa ( not his fault :P ) n called it the national food of south indians! Well, this tells u a lot about his sense of humour! He appears 'lite' but very  responsible guy..specially on roads! Loves riding bikes from wat i've seen and i must admit he is good at it :) In short, Apoorv is awesome n fun 2 hang out with.. jokes apart, had an awesome 3rd yr wit u! I dono wat i wud ve done without in optics lab apoorv :D ;)  Ohh..n not to forget his new obsession of counting calories..doughnut + Diet Coke!! I can go on n on about these lil details, bt th 1st I had heard of him was from a fren who said, AB is the guy with a fridge in his room!! n the story continues :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ranjita-pai-kasturi">Ranjita Pai Kasturi</a></p>
<p>AB ! I became his fan when after the first Physics CDC lecture, we walk out and the first thing he says is "Bhai, D ! " . After that I was inducted into the ISABCON. For all you ignorant people out there it is "International Society for AB Consciousness". Apart from his greatness in general, he has a big heart. Regrets taking Physics  But seriously without him the year would have been really dry. A trip to Zari became a tradition after IMA labs. A fellow bunker of lectures. He has on obsession with likes on his picture. Pure entertainment. I remember the time when he told us that his life's ambition was to pull of the greatest bank heist ever. According to him the four things a man needs, "Ladki Paisa Tharak Kamiyabi". This is line alone justifies the existence of ISABCON.

- Forever your Fan,

<p>"Ladki Paisa Tharak Kamiyabi." AB has been major influence in my philosophical pursuits, as discussions with him have led me to unfold the secrets of life and existence. Every conversation with him would be an eye opener. And the best thing about his preaching is, you tend to realize the answer to the question yourself, your soul answers. He is merely the guide. And it is not like these conversations are held in some special place, and are very intense. He can bring out the deeper meaning of things just by talking about them plainly. So impressed was I by his manner of discourse that it inspired me to found the International Society for AB Consciousness, an organisation that strives to awaken the AB inside you. Varad was instrumental in the founding of ISABCON, and today it boasts of numerous members. In fact, we plan to open a chapter at ETH Zurich starting next semester, making this a truly international spiritual organisation with AB as its inspirer.
Coming back to worldly pursuits, AB has a devil-may-care attitude about most things, and he is probably one of the most street-smart people on campus. This has been said and I shall say it again, Physics CDCs would not be the same without him. Also, AB has these typical Punjab traits like hating South Indian food and a passionate love for the finer things in life. His Chandigarh stories are now popular folklore. Coolest person of the batch, by far.
Cheers AB, O yea!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>AB, as he is famously known throughout the campus.  His infinite frndlist makes it quite evident how friendly and lively this guy is. He is alwaaaaaaaaayssssss(literaly always) happyyy and that is THE best part about him :D Even if you are sad or low, his company will make you forget all of that and he is always successful in making others laugh with all his nautankis. He has some typical moves which we call as "AB moves" which are hilarious and he can do them anywhere n in front of anyone :P:D He is a greaaattt guy, pure heart, down to earth and always ready to help :) N he is always sooooo much fun to be with and i have not laughed so much with anyone but you :D Really lucky to have met a gut like you. And I wish we remain as we are now in future as well. All the very best in life and may you get whatever you wish for(got one already ;)). Have a greaaaattt life !! :D:):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>
<p>AB. The first person I started respecting on campus. And, the last. I first met AB at a weekend Bogmalo outing.  And the thing that struck me then, still strikes me every time I meet him - he's always happy, positively ecstatic and forever smiling from ear to ear. And I envy him for that. He's extremely straight-forward, firm with his opinions and particular about the non-South Indianness of his edibles. Then, of course, there's AB gyaan - or ABisms as Jinx calls them - which are the staple diet of most discussions and, of course, the source of many of my per semester meme obsessions (particularly, "Bhai, D!"). He’s probably the only CHD dude I’m good friends with – because unlike them, he’s not pretentious or pseudo-cool. He’s just the very definition of cool. He might possess all those traits of CHD kewl-peoples, but then, he pulls them off with élan. To put it plainly, AB is the single most brilliant source of humor and entertainment – a hit with guys and girls alike. 
This awe of AB, led me and Jinx to institute ISABCON. Our motto: Awaken the AB within. It preaches life lessons, AB style. And that's the way they should be given. For the many unfortunate souls who could not be in AB's presence, fear not! We are compiling a treatise of ABisms - called AB Gita. Soon to be available at a HigginBothams near you. Good luck finding that one.
To sign off, I’m really glad to have had AB as a friend (and a philosophical guide) during my college years. Life wouldn’t have been lively without him and Nikunj would have been forever lost without him. Of course, he'll probably just shrug off this testimonial with his trademark Punjabi dialog - 'Ya Panchod, bahut angrezi phad ke rakhi hai launde ne' - and just give me a rib-cracking hug. But then, that’s AB for you. Cheers, AB! 
Apka Bhakt,
Varad

<p>AB....first of all the funniest and wittiest guy I've known in Bits, hands down.If I were to describe AB to someone I'd say he is the polar opposite of me,I mean he's street-smart,quick thinker,charmer of girls and very sociable.AB will give you the soundest advice on any topic,I remember one fine night he enlightened me on how to get girls,"Be yourself",he said with his Punjabi charisma.AB's philosophy in life is now part of Bits folklore,and he commands an ever-growing stream of devoted followers. With that lovable smile and cute dimples,it is no wonder that AB is so popular among girls.AB is also a budding footballer(his fakes and touches are a delight to watch) and a pro-FIFA player.This is one guy who radiates happiness and an 'aura of cool' around him. AB Saale mere bhai ki kyun li thi tune!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cheers!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/asim-ali">ASIM ALI</a></p>
<p>Very aptly named "Kanhaiyaa" by our very own grand old man. One of the most popular guys in our batch, one should have seen how people were all over him just to get clicked with him once. One of the three fortunate people to have attended the "Ladki, Paisa, Tharak, Kamyabi" night,  I feel so privileged now.  A fellow lover of bikes, we have done our fair share of triple riding back home and it has been fun every time. You can never stay sad around him, his smile is that infectious. His "Ob yaar, AB yaar" can lift up the spirits of anyone. Loves to gossip. A die-hard Chelsea fan, it is always fun to watch Utd.-Chelsea games with AB and Nikunj :P. It has been fun knowing you AB.

<p>AB!! I have known you since Chandigarh but it was really here that we actually talked. I can never forget the amazing and exciting trips we always end up having. Traveling with you is fun fun fun! haha. You are one of the cutest and most childish guy I have ever met. You are a charmer! humesha ladkiyon se ghira rehta hai! I love your ever smiling face and the zoozoo dance!! You have this grin on your face always like you are upto something and you do try to play 'games'. You convinced me and Nikhita not to by a fan aur uske baad khud hi bol bolkar hassi jaa raha tha! hehe. yaar sahi aadmi hai tu! But tere games itne succeed bhi nahi hote :P You are really friendly and really funny and you just keep spreading happiness all around. Its really funny to watch you try to come up with snide remarks and try to annoy people jo kabhi zyaada hota nahi hai! I guess the best part about you is the fact that along with being so kiddish when the time comes you show an amazing sense of responsibility and maturity. Travelling to and fro from Chandigarh is not just fun without you. Thank goodness tu Chandigarh main rehta hai! You are easily the best travelling company:) Its a real pleasure to know you. I don't think anyone can help smiling in your company! Aisa hi rahio! :) CHD. main aish karenge! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>
