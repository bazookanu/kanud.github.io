<h1 class="page-title">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</h1><p>Apoorva , the soft spoken ,gentle ,elegant… in nutshell perfect lady. Not only is she one of the prettiest friends of mine but also one of the closest ones. A very mature adviser at times..I really wonder how you bear with my unending stories with a smile.. And since it’s the first testimonial I am writing ..i have no idea how to begin with.. Straining my brain to remember the first time I met you, it was in Physics-1 class and I can completely understand what impression you have had of me :P  Hope I wiped it out now.. now u should agree m not a geek..  The endless time pass in corridor ( near the cooler ? )  my mimicry skills ur million dollar smile .. CP1 PAship together..PLCC assignment (however it went ..i cherish working with you ).it all brought us closer to each other.. and finally today I can acknowledge that we do possess some common natural frequency which brings us to resonance together :P . And the fact that it’s handful of days left with you I m getting a hollow sensation.. May you always get the best life has for you. Best Wishes!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>

<p>There is no girl as awsm as Apoorva !!!. She is the most outgoing girl i have  ever met.  Along with exceptional intelligence and  witty humor she is amazingly gorgeous. She was the Secretary of the Fashion Club, editor of Melange, active member of Abhigyan and event manager of School Bag event in Quark. I first met her in Aerodynamics Club in the first month on campus and since then she continues to enthrall me with the spark in her deep black eyes, dedication to work and brilliant sense of humor. Apoorva is an exceptional coder and comes up with very elegant algorithms with very less effort. Its no wonder she has been P.A. for computer programming course many times.  We were also  together in PS1 and worked on the same project. Her die hard optimism gives you so much hope that work becomes so much fun. During PS1 we went for a short trek in which she stunned me by being such an awsm athlete as well !!!. She is always calm and confident and is rarely tensed. She is very enthusiastic about learning new things and mastering them. She is also a pet lover, and has a very intelligent cat called lucky. Apart from being so talented, she is very loyal, caring and one of my best friends. All the best for the future.!!!!! :-)

<p>A strong-willed, conscientious,hard-working,ambitious,witty person. When I first met her, I was pleased to know that she shared my love for Biology. The ace coder that she is, she still continues to work in Biology-be it applying her CS skills, or just pure Bio work.Application of Education to an interest-simply Superb!! Also very soft-spoken and sensitive.She never hesitates to give an honest opinion. She is a loyal warm-hearted friend, with a conscience that is more active than most people. She stands for what she believes in, even if she is alone. I might have upset her at times with some of my flim-flams, and she has always put me on the right track. She also  has a deep desire for social service-mostly eduction of poor children.... _/\_. She can never tolerate injustice and is deeply troubled when others are sad.I truly respect her as an engineer, more as a person, and even more as a friend!! All the Best!  :))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>A silent, soft spoken, down to earth person..i met Apoorva during my ps1 and it is a pleasure to have known her since. A very intelligent person with a mind of her own, she gets actively involved in all the events around which has gained her the respect of everyone who knows her. Always with a gentle smile on her face, her ability to connect with people is inspiring....all in all a very good person at heart and a good friend i am glad i met you and wish you a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-deshpande">Aditya Deshpande</a></p>
<p>Apoorva... the pretty lady... one of the most sophisticated, soft, loyal,helping, beautiful, intelligent , down to earth girl... She is a perfect example of beauty with brains, the way she has managed FashP, Abhigyaan and studies is really commendable.... I got to know her in 1-1, from then our bonding grew stronger.... One advice that she gave me before our CP1 online was that whatever I am studying, I should study for myself and I should not get scared, that really helped me a lot and that still helps me a lot... Its better to call you a perfect example of Brain, beauty and Heart... Be in touch.... All the best... you will sure achieve what you want... :)   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>

<p>I dont really remember when we met first.. probably in Pranita's room when we were all struggling to make timetable :D But we definitely became close friends thanks to the common classes and unfruitful areodynamics sessions (we still dint get that glider back!)... I remember counting 'means' in amit setia’s M2 lecture :P And the 'embarrassing moments' in library... :D (my phone ringing, your songs playing on speaker..)  Also the afternoon 'weekly baths' classes and those ‘bedbug days’ :P Apoorva is a really soft spoken person… She used to (even now I guess :P) call her mom everyday before/after lunch and the way she spoke, it was hard to believe she was speaking Konkani.. she has such sweet n soft voice (in my perception Konkani sounds a bit rough :P).. She speaks in such low voice sometimes that even if she speaks normally (without whispering) in library no one really notices :D She does well in whatever she likes and takes li8 whtevr she doesn’t (like some AAOC courses :P) As everyone mentioned, this beauty with brains has managed fashP, abhigyaan, PA(CP1), acads n weekly (almost :P) home visits very well! Also she is very neat n tidy.. you should see her room… so well arranged every single moment! Also she is confused (about small things) a lot of times (and keeps fluctuating between yes-no-yes-no…) when asked something but rarely accepts that she does so! To sum it up.. you will be always remembered as one of the closest friends!! Good luck.. have fun.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Our introduction was not very smooth. At first, she mistook me for someone else, she thought Aditya Modak was someone else, and I was someone else. And I thought I had upset her with my bull-in-a-china-shop way during the glider flying in the VGH lawns.Then at the end of sem 2, all the misunderstandings were cleared.Since then, we have been great friends.And PS1 with Paritosh and Apoorva was one of the best times!!They discovered this amazing place 'The Paratha Place' which served fabulous 'Kheema Parathas'.Last year, her EPS class tales were a constant source of entertainment....Talking about 'Sentilata' always turned into a laughter riot :-D. And yes, she also shares my passion for cursing the less-than-useless AAOC subject (to Beelzebub with them). Then there's also the FashP 'BullDog' incident, and the 'Coco-Bongo' dance!! That was hilarious!! Now lets talk business and settle debts- You owe me the 1.84 INR,and I owe you the Nana-Patekar radio best audience award!! The lifesaver that she is, she lent me her extra laptop for the compre when my laptop gave up on me.!!--LIFESAVER--And yes, that Kumar Sanu collection CD was faaabulous!! Thanks for being a great friend! Aaal the best!! :))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Remember the first time we were introduced to each other?Good Lord I made a LOL of myself.Never ever felt so stupid in life.Please dont tell the incident to anyone ( :( ).Apoorva is a no nonsense,obedient,hard-working,diligent student.A skilled programmer and one of the few people on campus who loves biology she is also one of the few select ones who is pursuing her interest by mixing computer science with biology.A down to earth,honest,cool,calm and composed person one thing worth mentioning is that she is a very good listener. (never gets irritated with my,paritosh and aditya's bakwaas :P ).She is also a fellow animal lover :D .Hope you have a great future.Stay in touch.All The Best Wishes!!!!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-satish-kulkarni">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>I first noticed her during the Aryaan's Press meet. After coming to BITS, we were closer in part because we were Goans , in Comp Sci, had consecutive ID numbers and both of us loved dogs! It was fun then, to discuss over a lot of BITS issues including hostels, faculty and acads. I also got many boys asking me her name and number in first year :P That implies she looks very good, but you don't need a testimonial to testify that :P She has a famous characteristic walking style (read catwalk ) and very long hair :P. She has been part of numerous activities @ BITS (Abhigyaan, FashP, School Bag ...). She is very sweet (mean this one) and soft spoken and doesn't give herself the airs. She might appear vulnerable from the outside but she is very strong inside. Her determination made her supercharge her way to the top after an average 1st sem. She helped me with anything that I wanted without hesitation and was the single point of contact for the girls hostel at one time  ( the misplaced notebook notice ! ) . For some reasons (which I don't remember now) I called her a Vuvuzela and she called me Pingu O.o  . I am sure I have written much lesser than what I would've an year ago because we haven't met a lot in recent times.Nonetheless its great to have been her friend. Best of luck for the future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>
<p>Apoo!!!Perfect example of "Beauty with Extraordinary Brains". A very sensitive, delicate girl with a soft voice and well-known in our campus..remember the good old days when i had to reiterate all your answers in aryans? ;). She has the cleanest room in our hostel and equally pure is her heart! She manages her acads very well along with club activities like FashP& Abhigyan. She is of the very few friends I had before I joined BITS. I wonder how to begin describing our friendship and the memories attached ! The best ones i can recollect are from aryans days when we used to sit next to each other but used to pass chits for having a conversation :D! I now realize how innocent and polite we "kids" were back then! By the way, you are still a kid at heart:D. And yeah one more funny incident which i can never forget! The one in which i was trying to cheer you up(don't remember why you were sad though!) and you know what followed later :P. Initially i thought you were very reserved! But i was proved wrong when you had called me to share about the "duggu" incident. The long phone conversations we had back served as starters to our friendship.That was when i learnt to be open with you. You have been one of my best mates ever since. The long chats we had during those boring holidays before joining college will be cherished.Coming to life @ Bits, it was a boon to have a friend like you. Without you, i would have missed all my morning classes. In short you are my alarm clock! Thank you for patiently waking me up everyday. I dont even know how to re-pay you for this :P. You are more than a caring friend to me when you took care each time i fell sick or  threatened me the countless number of times I would miss my meals :D. Classes would have been dry and boring without your company, be it in Aryans or BITS. The outings which we had were memorable. You were there with me all along whenever I needed you. You are trust-worthy, humble and down-to-earth! In short, you are Ms. Perfect. Thank you for being such a wonderful friend! Change only for the better :). Love you loads! I am sure we'll stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
<p>At 7 in the morning a knock on all cs ppl’s door … yes it would be her … to wake up ppl 4 the classes. A girl whose voice sounds the same when she whispers or talks :P … A girl with one of the most tidiest rooms in the corridor …   This is apoorva .. one of the most soft spoken and the most elegant  girls in BITS.  The one who carries herself very well.  I don’t remember being close to her in the 1st semester as we did not have ne common classes but eventually turned out to be in the same group.  Then came the pre cdcs and cdcs  where we became more closer. 
I remember on the registration of  second semester I had not paid the fee and there was a lot of problems running 4m SAC to B Dome … and she was there all the time with me … helping me was much as possible … That was when I realized that  she is the helping and caring types. All those boring classes with her in the 3rd year .. was loads of fun (eg: deco … remember we used to draw things .. n laugh at it so much ) … oh yeah not to forget your msgs during classes were just mind blowing .. :P  . Watching movies and friends with you were amazing 
Apoorva is a very good writer, coder and a pragmatic person  who is a little fickle minded at times :P .. A great person to be with … All the best for your future .. Gona miss you next year ?

<p>i wish people with same names had same qualities also :P  your sweetness, the calm on your face, elegance with which you carry yourself have no match! the glitter in your eyes when u go on and on with your cat and dog stories is just adorable! know some one might  thing i am just another one of ur crazy stalkers on campus :P but then i do love so much abt you ! :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apurva-mudgal">Apurva Mudgal</a></p>
<p>The words elegant, dainty, graceful come to mind when one sees Apoorva. After meeting her for the first time in Abhigyaan classes, extremely caring and gentle added to that list. She was a beloved teacher and friend to the students in Abhigyaan. I got to know her better when mutual interest in Biology lead us to choose BPL as an elective. While I stopped, her interest carried her on to do a project in Biology. She is also a very good manager of events, the amount of ground work done  for School Bag, Quark'11 (inviting schools, getting sponsors, preparing the quiz, having the patience to twist bits of garment to flowers!) was simply mind boggling. She is also extremely soft-spoken, there have been instances when I have simply nodded without actually hearing all the words in the sentence :D . I enjoyed the time spent in BPL, School Bag and Abhigyaan. All the best for the future, keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
<p>I know Apoorva right from my 11 std. where we used to go for the same coaching classes and since then a very close friend of mine :)….. A “Beauty with brains” as everyone calls her…..She is very kind hearted, soft spoken, gentle, matured, sensitive, optimistic, very down to earth, helpful, confident, the Pro and a very very gorgeous friend of mine….She is a very hardworking and determined person….has been successful in achieving things because of her hard working nature and I’m a big fan of her this attitude :)……Though back in Aryans where I knew you as a calm, sincere, soft spoken person, in BITS I was introduced to a fun loving, outgoing and crazy (very rarely :P) Apoorva vich took me by surprise…..I will always remember dose late nite chats v had in my room on any random topic which used to come to our minds and watching movies together and I love the way you call me “shruttu”:P..….Her love for pets is just amazing and she can go on and on talking about her cat “Lucky”… She has the most clean and well arranged room in our corridor….It was fun working with you as an EM for Schoolbag (Rembr the last min preparations :P)…She has managed her acads well with Fashp, Abhigyaan…..It was a pleasure having such a lovely friend like you….All the very best for your future and I’m sure you are to reach great heights :)!!...Do stay in touch….<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-sanjay-vaze">Shruti Sanjay Vaze</a></p>
<p>There are soo many things u can write about her!
Got to know her more after we landed up in the same boring teny john's class for phy 2 :P 
Till then the only memory i have of her is hearing from a lot of people that her room is the cleanest in the hostel and i must say that is very true!
Once i got to know her i have realised she is one amazing combination of a LOT many gr8 qualities!
Its like if all students here were cellphones she would have been the iphone :P She is just perfect and truly has a class of her own. Always graceful, whether in her tshirt and jeans or in her fashp attires or even in her night pajamas.
Truly beautiful and naturally and her smile just lights up her face even more ! :)
Earlier i used to hate so many things about girls(still do sumwt i guess :P ) but the way she carries herself in that feminine way, i have begun to respect that and i realised that being a girl can actually be that great.
She is seriously someone to look up to. 
Great at acads and really loves her branch ,CS and not just a hardworker but likes working hard whetehr it is studying or being involved in whatever she does, whether it was abhigyaan or school bag or fashp. She gives her all to it.
All this of course every1 knows..but here's another thing: she is very adventurous too! :)
Won't say no to a lot of things that many girls would easily say no to like paintball ! :)
Had so much fun dat day!
Always ready for anything u cn suggest and ready to kick back (:P) in answer and a really fun person to hang out with! :)
I know you'll do great in life! 
Will miss you a lot :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
