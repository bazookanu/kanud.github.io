<p>Apurva a.k.a Dr. Mudgal( and also Dr. Moo sometimes :P) is a hard-core socialite in the campus!! She obviously has a lot of credentials, but the most important one I guess is, being a very active member of "The Food Gang"!! :P...Her presence will always make things happier and all chit-chatty!!..:D...I will always cherish our all night talks and shopping sprees!! 
The thing i love about her is that she says whatever is in her heart!!..Way to go gal!!...Its needless to say that wherever you will end up will be amazing and you truly deserve all the greatness in life!! And obviously we will keep in touch and continue having a blast!!..:D...Miss ya loadss!!...Have a rocking life ahead!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>She is one hell of a daring person I know. I was awed by her courage when single handedly she had the courage to stand for gensec, not caring about even a single person. She is a lady who will always leave an impression on you. She's smart, rationale and a true professional. All the best to you! Will always cherish my first year with you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Having first met Apurva at the Depp Waves Poster Packaging Session in 2009, I was struck by her confidence and intrepidity. Since then Apurva has impressed one and all, with her work in various departments, or with her bold decision to contest for the post of GenSec. She is an amazing person to talk to, and has a sense of humour that is interesting in its own sense,  Apurva is intelligent ,confident and audacious, and is sure to leave her mark wherever she goes. Wishing you loads of luck Apurva, I know that you will be successful wherever you go!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>
<p>Apurva is one of the most interesting people I've met on campus. A lot of fun to hang around with, smart, caring and above all she will always stand for what she believes in no matter what.  It has been great knowing you Apurva and you are one of those very few people I know, who haven't changed a bit since I first met them. I've shared quite a few fun moments with you, all those elaborate discussions on college festivals, eating your pineapples, and how can I forget that I shared my first cheese garlic naan with you! You have a brilliant personality and I know for a fact you will do great things in the future. Will miss you having around a lot! Wishing you lots of luck. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>Apurva! you are a very sweet person! Very kind, fun to talk to and hang around with, approachable, pretty, hardworking and very smart. You are one person who makes an impact! I love the way you manage your multiple responsibilities and keep yourself busy all the time :) Ive loved all the times i have spent with you. Like for Bhagirath, few times eating in the mess, stopping by ur room every whie passing by to go to mine, even in 1st yr i remember u coming to my room to practice EG :) Its always a pleasure hanging around. And one more thing...you are probably a human version of Yello Pages...having almost any contact that anyone could want! I'm sure you will have an awesome life ahead! do keep in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tara-ramanan">Tara Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Probably one of the most fun females in campus, Apurva aka Moti is awesome company any time. She is a dedicated student student, swimmer, baddy player, event organiser etc etc. She has a hell lot of credential backing up her qualities. 
You have been a wonderful friend to me!! Wish you all the success in life

<p>I first met her right after the elections. She was a mini-celebrity then, and I was still new and unknown. The first time she called me for DePP work, I was actually nervous- looking for her approval at every step. We've become great friends since. I've always thought of her as an elder sister. I can't thank her enough for making me quit the Melange team :P But above all I'd like to thank her just for being there. I've told her things I daren't tell anyone else, and she's been supportive and encouraging all along. She is one of those incredible talents on campus that perhaps not many know fully about, but those who do, will cherish the memories with her forever. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-vikas">Akshay Vikas</a></p>
<p>Mudgal or Dr. Mu (as she is popularly called) is very smart and efficient.She can get a bit crazy sometimes when it's past her bedtime and she is still outside!  She can make everyone feel happy around her. She loves shopping and it's so much fun to discuss it with her. She is very creative and thoughtful and puts in lot of efforts when she gives gifts .She is also very carefree, bindaas kinda chick and can give very honest opinions. Also she knows about more than half the campus! She has solutions for almost everything.I always have a good time with her though her membership of the 'food gang' ,and me being against what it stands for ,clearly shows we have different tastes ! :D She is an amazing and unique person :) Have an awesome life ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>
<p>Apurva (Appu) is strength, courage, determination personified. She is never afraid of anything or anyone. Whenever you are around her, you will always be happy with her ever cheerful, smiling chubby cute face. If anyone wants any tips about shopping, she is the one to contact. She is extremely creative and it can be very well seen by all the funky work she always do. She is an amazing friend, who is ready to go out with u whenevr you feel low. All those crazy acts, all masti in our rooms which we did will always be with me. I hope she gets whatever she wishes in her life!! All the best Mudgal :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>She is my food gang partner. She has great choice in food!! She is a shopaholic, anywhere we go, even at places like utorda she will want to buy something for her. But yea she has a good choice in shopping too :D. Very helpful and fun loving person. She also has a good sense of humor. All the masti we have done on the outings were just \m/ and as a fellow food gang member she will always be on my side when the time comes to take sides :D. She is a total nerd, her jokes are also mostly nerdy, and weird think about her is, being in college she sleeps at 10am n wakes up at 4am, just to feel the silence at 4am. A great friend. All the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>

<p>Superwoman. Lady Godfather. Lots of these adjectives are insufficient to describe Apurva. She's got one hell of a never-say-die attitude, and is one of those ' 50 Strongest Women in Asia' type person. I regret getting to know her well only in the third year. All those labs where she did the experiments, while I lazed around referencing Andaz Apna Apna or discussing Beatles with Varad, and all those times where she's fought for our marks have helped me pass Analog. From fighting for General Secretary to writing electronics papers for Las Vegas to acing academics and MUN and what not, she's done it all. And with great courage - something we've all admired in her. Thank you for everything Apruva. Here's wishing you all the success and happiness you so rightly deserve!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>There must be times when you are ask yourself---Have i made it large??....OBB yes,you have...she has a huge list of credentials..churned each moment of BITS life to add some value into her...The way she carries herself is fantastic..I didn't quite know her much until MUN and now CL ofcourse,she is an awesome,friendly manager..All set to rock +tr8 and ticker next sem,she is bound to excel!...All the best!...:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jaskaran-bir-singh">Jaskaran Bir Singh</a></p>
<p>motii, the one person who can say "been there, done that" to almost everything :P:P
fun- loving, go- getter, dedicated, hardworking are not enough to describe you.  stay he way you are. al the best in life :):):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-gupta">Arushi Gupta</a></p>
<p>Apurva Mudgal...one of the best seniors I have met...awesome, fun-loving..wen I first met her, her personality had actually made me nervous..bt den realised shes as easy going as anyone could be! Intelligent, smart..perfect ingredients for someone to have an awesome persona! way to go 'didi' :-P keep rocking!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/null">NULL</a></p>
<p>Simple, sweet and dependable. It was nice to have worked with you both times (thank you for making those graphs for me just 5mins. before the lab)  and know you. I admire your striking personality which makes you stand out from the rest of the crowd. Wishing you all the best for all your endeavors :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-shirbhate">Sahil Shirbhate</a></p>
<p>I wish I’d written this earlier, so mine would’ve been right below Nakul’s testimonial and I could have finished  the testimonial off by saying ‘Same as Above’ :P Just kidding. I don’t know anyone else who has the number and variety of credentials she does. Be it academic or extra-curricular, it’s all there on her resume. An epitome of sheer grit, courage and a forceful personality. I second Nakul’s opinion that we’re gonna see her on some ‘Most Powerful (quite literally) Women’ list in due course of time. Please don’t clobber me for that wisecrack. Of course, this cannot be complete without thanking you for seeing me through Analog & Commsys lab – 3-2 EEE would have been a bigger disaster had it not been for your help. Cheers! Oh, and I forgot to mention, I’m still pissed at your entire team for not going to Vegas – Hyderabad over Vegas, seriously?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>

<p>Apurva has a very strong personality that inspires  any person in more than one way. She is among the best when it comes to managing things She takes up countless responsibilities, pursues  acads with diligence and spends sufficient time decorating her room with creative things. She has a valid and clear cut opinion about everything and can comment on a wide variety of topics, be it related to acads or socially relevant issues or business.  Always optimistic, practical and logical, she takes bold decisions and has all the qualities of a leader. A very understanding friend and a dedicated EEE mate. I will cherish the moments we spent together, on IEEE  project, Cadence assignment ( "Netlist matching" !!! ), DECO lab and our random discussions in mess. She is very good at figuring out how a malfunctioning set of LEDs can get the correct output, even when you know the circuit is wrong :P - a bit of finger magic there!! Apurva, I will really miss you... All the Best for your future, which I'm sure is going to be very bright! Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>

<p>Apurva has quite a strong personality with a confidence I have always admired. She won’t really care about what other people think and will stand up for what she believes in. She is quite straightforward and influential too. A multi-faceted person, she has managed to do quite a lot of things in the stay at BITS. Though we haven’t been in touch this past year coz of different classes and other commitments, you will always be remembered as a good friend. All the best! I am sure you will reach great heights! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
