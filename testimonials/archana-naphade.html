<h1 class="page-title">Archana Naphade</h1><p>Archana Naphade is one of my best friends. She is a person you can tell your secrets and trust her with them. She is kind of naughty but in a good manner. Her drawing is really good. Of course it would be, she is in Arts n Deco and was the successful coordinator of Waves 2011. Her taste in music is worth mentioning. And oh yes, how can I forget, her voice is really sweet. I wonder why she never tried for the Music Club. She sing so well that she could replace Shreya Ghoshal anytime! :P

She knows how to enjoy the moment and how to talk, what to talk and when to talk. Chatting with her either on useful or useless topics, she would being a smile to your face :)

I wish her a great successful future, full of happiness and satisfaction. May your art and your voice take you to great heights.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Archana has a terrific comic timing.. she is a spirited dancer,awesome artist.. her room will always have a movie or a song running whenever you step into it...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>Archana aka Vali@nt, is one of the maddest, fun loving, incredible and amazing persons to talk to. Be it her radio, Velli ka Radio @ http://10.4.14.***:8080, or her main chat trolling :D, or her art skills, she shines through all of them, making quite a statement, With an amazing job as the Waves Coordinator for Arts and Deco, she played a huge role, in the department's success during Waves. She has been one awesome person, and I wish that she scales heights wherever she goes.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>
<p>Gregarious, mad, fun, dhinchak, art & radio... if you hear all of these words together she will be the first person to come to your mind. Having worked as the Waves coordi for Arts & Deco, she became one of the few girls to lead a big department to glory. A natural artist and a crazy dancer, you don't want to challenge her to a dance off on a dj nite. A good friend who values you and can support you through thick and thin, Archana is one awesome person.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>It gets very hard to describe a person who is so close to you. Archana is one such person for me. She is most loyal , honest person I've ever seen. She is a person who can laugh at almost anything always keeping her smile up. You can never leave without a smile when she strikes a joke , if not for the joke you will atleast end up striking a laughter with her :) :D . She has superb art skills ! Take it Drawing , Painting , Sketching , Music ,  Dance ! You name it. She is one 360* artiste ... And her tastes are so adorable as she gives preference to the sparkly things that appeal more to her than the world... She is her own person first ,  which is the most adorable thing.  She has Splendid narrating skills - her pauses , and expressions when she narrates something will definitely leave you spell bound as if you are listening to a director who explains the Screenplay to the actor!!! She loves Physics $ Mechanics . She is a person who is firm on principles - sometimes makes me feel like "Am I staying with my mom dad ?? " ... Yet so fun loving person. She is a person who can lit up your life with her smiles and PJ's :P  Had so much fun together take it Mainchat , or Real Life . . Have a great future dear friend ! There is no end for praises ! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>One of those people who really live life king-size !! I have never ever seen her worried !! And now that I'm trying to remember.. .. i cant even remember her face when she wasnt smiling.. .. She is one of the best artists I've ever met.. her free nature in true life is reflected in all its glory in her art work..  she is soo very positive in her approach that her mere presence in room infatuates everyone with a strange happy energy... one of the most jovial persons i know.. and its really fun when she lets her imaginations run wild and narrates those to alll around her.. And how can i ever forget her eternal presence on the DC mainchat..  Last but not the least.. she is true to herself and comfortable in her skin... and of course a very good friend of mine :) Go girl.. Best of luck in life..and Enjoy as you always do :)

<p>I met you online in rather strange circumstances ;) . And after intermittent chats for about a year, we finally met just once. Therefore, it's not surprising that I know more about Vali@nt than about you.
You're artistic and you have a really melodious voice. Surprisingly, you're also very down to earth for somebody so talented. From the little that I know, you also appear to be a rather crazy fun loving person. Someone who has all the time in the world to publicize her radio, or simply engage in banal DC mainchat, or respond to my intermittent pings without a hint of irritation. :P
I will always remember the embarassing/funnny/crazy moments I've had with you (yes, mostly online) as myself/onion/my-other-dc-nicks-you-don't-yet-know. :P 
All the very best for your future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>

<p>Archu !! Ms. V@lient or Velli.. :P is a peson who can laugh at some of the silliest things going around ! This girl has a terrific sense of humour and comic timing !! True artist in every sense, this girl is highly creative and spontaneous in every way. She will continue to entertain you even in the most skeptical situations and you would will be forced to laugh at the same ! One girl who has all good values imbibed in her, who is fun loving and full of enthusiasm. This girl has an exceptional ability to prepare notes and yes I remember the way you write in the labs. Compiling everything in a beautiful handwriting, extremely appreciable !! I wish you all the luck for a bright future ahead and I know you are going to reach milestones you have set ! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>

<p>She is a very talented artist and the most deserving member in arts & deco. She is known for two things mainly in the campus her arts and her DC nick. There are more things about her that just these two (although these are the most important for her :P ), she is funny, sarcastic, cheerful and also mad really mad :P. I wish you great success in your life. All the best!! Cheers!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>So this gal (from my hometown, yeah and for coincidence our dad's knew each other before) was supposed to come to my house for guidance when she was selected......dat first impression of her -- nerdy,I thought how can someone be so nerdy, and she is somewhat but c'mon everyone knows how "velli" she is. She is always there on DC .....her radio suxx max...:P .. sometimes ache laga leti hai. i also thought she would be some soul from some unknown world but then there she is bakbak karnewali ....DC pe toh hai hi but in real life also. She is good at art work.....Waves coordi fr ArtsnD...abhitak tr8 nahi di ....kaam karti hai ???
no idea...dekha toh nahi kabhi :P. Also somedays back i got to know she sings well....Please make an appointment for me....thats's all. Hope you succeed in life. Have fun . Have a blast . Keep rocking. :)

<p>Archana urf V@liant a.k.a Velli...the first time I met her was on DC. Talking to her, at least one thing was clear. Here is a person who really doesn't care what others think of her, and knows how to enjoy life. I heard her sing 'Yashomati Maiyya' and 'Tera saya' on DC, and man, she does have a great voice. But as if that wasn't enough, i came to know she is in Arts and Deco, and after seeing  few of her pics (some as display pics on Gtalk) I really wondered how can someone be so versatile. She was always fun to talk with on DC, but having met her in person with the other members of 'Gola Barood family', I realized all you could do around her is laugh because she is really good at pulling your legs. With so much talent in her, I am sure she would do great in life. All the Best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-bajpai">Vibhor Bajpai</a></p>

<p>Velliiii!!!! Well, I had the honour of meeting this person through Waves coco, though I had heard a lot about her sincmy 2nd year! She is one awesome person! Dikhati nahi hai, par hai! She’s to start with, extremely innocent, and one of the “goodest” people on campus! Weighs every word before saying it, thinks ki saamnewaale ko bura to nahi lagega na, yet is very smart and intelligent! Highly creative, very understanding, very respectable, highly dedicated, and emotionally very strong! The way she changed the deco in Waves was amazing. Itne se budget mein ITNAAAAAAA SAAARRAAA kar denge ye toh maine nahi socha tha! Baaki dc par to kripa rehti hi hai inki! Jab bhi online dikhu tab ek baar toh inka “yo” ho hi jaata hai! Baaki toh bas, ise darane mein bahot mazaa aata hai! Ekdum dar kar, “huhhh, kaisa darata hai”  aise bolti hai! :P anyways, u have a long way to go in life! Best of luck for that and always keep smiling! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>

<p>Hmmm....so many things to say. Archana is an artist par excellence. A person very funny and very active on DC and has an apparently lost and docile look on her face that hides her amazing sense of humour. But, being a singer, i'll remmber her for her voice. She has a very interesting voice, so thin but with such great range. I can remember all those times when I asked her to sing a song just because I wanted to hear the song in her voice. But i'll also remember her for the fact that we had been great friends, and i absolutely miss all those times when we used to go as a group for the night trips to cp. Unforgettable times, those. Not to forget that she has a wonderful smile, complete with braces. :P :P and a laugh that is seriously contagious. She has made me hear so many Telugu songs and we have had so much to discuss and share. May your life be truly blessed and may you find great success and complete happiness. See you in Jan!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>

<p>Obviously it seems i dont know her like many of you do ... as the girl on DC or art& deco member ... I just know her as a good friend ... lots of  fun to hangout with ... surprisingly witty ... almost can match me :P She can pickup languages pretty quick as far as the comparison is with me :D She mingles with people pretty quick ... she is definitely lively company .Hey i didnt need to know much more to know that she is a very good friend :) Well it hasnt been long since we starting hanging out ... so iam guessing it will take more time to get sick of me ... So looking forward to more fun :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sathwik-tulasi">Sathwik tulasi</a></p>
