<h1 class="page-title">Arjun Banerji</h1><p>I'm trying to think where should I start from. So many amazing moments were spent with Arjun that it makes me sad to just to think how little time is left and how quickly time passed. It seems almost like yesterday when I met this awesome guitarist. I remember how everyone used to just crowd up in his room to see him play. I wish I had more time to get to know him  better. Arjun is one of the most polite people one can meet in a lifetime. He will make sure that he is not hurting anyone in any possible way, and always tries to make everyone happy. Truly a great friend. His weird (and sometimes annoying :P) ways of doing stuff and behavior have given us hours of hysterical moments. Arjun is different in so many ways that its hard to describe him, but if I had to describe him in 5 words they would be - Guitarist, Foodie, Gamer, Lazy and Bald (of course ). I guess one of the best time we had were when we used to just sit idly in his room, with great music in the background and just discussing about life and pretty much everything under the stars. I'll really miss you man. Thanks for the great time.
May the force be with you, always.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>Arjun, the most modest and polite person i have ever met in my life, his modesty, humbleness and awesome personality makes him a great human being and it has been a pleasure to be friends with him. A great great Gamer he is and has been my sole inspiration to enter into this field :D... He is one of the few people who truly enjoys and acknowledges food, I've seen him many times showing his anger for the people who waste food in mess, this shows his true love for food. He is an awesome guitarist who knows a lot about it and has helped many people learn how to play it. He has this awesome skill of adding sound effects in whatever he says and it is something that always catches your attention and I will always remember him for that!!. He has his own distinctive style of doing things and he will always make sure that he is not causing any trouble for anyone. He will always be there for you taking your side when you are left alone and he will make sure no one hurts you in any way. Whenever you are upset he will be there for you to boost your morale up. A true friend "Jo Chirag Lekar Dhoondhne Se Bhi Na Mile". I have great memories with him , all the fun we had in our corridor CHEERS to all those awesome moments. Will surely stay in touch with you.All the best for your future, I'm sure you will achieve great heights!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
