<h1 class="page-title">Arjun Mathew Eranacal</h1><p>He is one of my good friends. He is smart and extremely lazy :P . He has got exceptional problem solving skills and is a sharp thinker. He is a pro in CS be it Computer Science or Counter Strike. Apart from that, he is a die hard WWE fan and a gym enthusiast. I wish you all the best in the coming years and hope that your dreams come true :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vivek-g-kamath">Vivek G Kamath</a></p>
<p>We need such people in CS.... proism in coding and academics he is one of the so called nerd of CS.A very simple person who never gets offended and keeps his cool at all time.One rarely find friends like him.Sometime he takes Li8...at-least that is what he says leaving the fact that he he phodufies most of the subject.He is extremely helpful to others and it has been a gr8 time with him.May you have a gr8 life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>He is a very intelligent and competitive being. In my opinion, he is arguably one of the bests when it comes to coding. He thinks faster than most others, but wether they all result in desired consequences are yet to be determined :P. A die hard fan of Sachin, Triple H and Mohanlal, i fondly recall our numerous debates as to who's favourites are better. We were involved in making a video together that was popular on DC and we were gym partners too for over two years. Its really hard to forget the many such memorable experiences that we've had in the three years we've known each other. Gud luck 4 ur future, and remember some things are best left unseen, unheard and unspoken.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thomas-abu-c">THOMAS ABU C</a></p>
<p>Arjun is one of the most intelligent and sincere person I know. Though his laziness can trick you at times into thinking he is taking lite..Trust me its quite the opposite. A hard worker who always sits on the first bench and does his friends' assignments without making them feel guilty, Arjun is truly a gem of a person. A WWE fan , the only guy who can challenge Tuhin Shah in terms of WWE knowledge and a big fan of HHH. BTW He got a decent JEE rank too but instead chose to come here to increase the level of our Institute. Aaap great ho EraNikal _/\_ Keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
