<p>"Orkeit" . Nope, I didn't make up that shitty name, it was his own co-creation with "wannabe superstudd" Gummy. Anyway coming back to the topic of this bitch. Bhatte is easily one of my closest and most cherished friends. He is one of THE MOST talented people I have known. A literary wizard, natural actor, and top notch striker (spent most of it on the bench sadly :( ). This chap has a rather quirky appetite for movies and music. To be honest ,some of it is quite brilliant actually. Ok that shit was too formal . This nut is absolutely wild when bhand , put together Chintu and you are begging them to stop the laugh riot. This chap loves  drawing up overly spiced up vivid descriptions  for the sake of a good laugh (Yes, I have been the protagonist of quite a few of them and they are funny as hell !) . A sense of humour bordering on being a maniac and laughter infectious (Chintu and this fucktard would loop "Chodu CID" 5 times over in a span of 1 hour,  and we'd all laugh louder every single time). We redefined the 'taking li8' culture with our AoE marathons in between the exams convincing ourselves ' all iezz bhell, naxt taim phodenge '. Insane fun to hang out with and a great friend. I am actually saddened by the fact that this guy is going away in Sem 1 and this chapter will come to a close sooner than I anticipated. It would only be fair for me to say I am fortunate and that it's an honour to  have a friend like you. I am sure you will be successful in life and can only hope our path's meet. Good luck Bitch. Cheers and Toodles. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhananjay-deepak-sathe">Dhananjay Deepak Sathe</a></p>
<p>Arka is my pop culture mentor- he's introduced me to most of the good cinema and TV I have seen. He generally does not like anything mainstream, so if many people you know have seen a movie or heard a band, chances are Arka hasn't. There is also the obscure sense of humour that we share, which has led us to share some of the sensational stuff the www has to offer. He becomes transcendent after enough intoxication, and Arka's love for cooking is now popular folklore. Immensely knowledgeable, a good quizzer and a prodigious writer, he fits the typical Bengali stereotype in some ways. But then, he's cool unlike a lot of other Bengalis. Also, the yeah-yeah dance GIF remains to be made.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Bhatta aka Bongoli aka Bengal Tiger is truly a man of many talents, a part of the Literary and Debating Club, Drama Club as well as the BITS FC squad. Hes also called Dada because of his Gully Cricket talent, well that speaks for itself. Bhatta also has, well, unique tastes when it comes to movies and music. I remember how he would gather all of us and make us watch a certain scene from Bruno. His favourite past-times are watching viral you-tube videos(chodu cid, worlds worst cry and annoying orange, to name a few), and taking Varads case. We also share the common interest for good food, but Bhatta,it seems, has moved on to cooking these days. He also happens to be a fellow EEE victim, and has been there as we withstood all the hardships under ' the maan', moorthy etc. and finally found solace in AoE!
We had a great time in Bangalore and PS II is going to be even bigger! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Bhatteezz! The brilliant bong! Bhatta's wit, sarcasm and humor always has everyone laughing their tops off. He's got a natural ability to make any situation a whole lot lighter with his infectious laughter and his twisted humor :P. He's one of the best strikers i know and i'm still mighty pissed at him for pulling out of the SPREE squad. I'm going to miss all the weird videos that bhatta always digs up on DC and has everyone addicted too very soon. His laughter is infectious and he always seems to find the most random things ridiculously funny which rubs of on everyone else there. I don't think i've ever seen bhattez without that smile on his face and i'm going to miss this smooth-talking-wanna-be-nigga-bong!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Bhatta, the hot Bong, the ladies man. Bhatta, the guy with the devil's smirk on his face, always. This 'Posh bitch' is the person I'll probably miss the most on campus. All those hours of watching and discussing films,directors, Youtube shit are priceless memories. This lean mean machine is one of my closest friends on campus. His antics are campus folklore , his Hindi adorable, his devil-may-care attitude to life infectious. He's undoubtedly the baap of sharing everything weird and queer under the sun. We've had some epic memories on campus, be it all those Velino's or Bogmalo trips, the fucked-up TRW days, french film madness, Varod-case taking sessions etc. Fellow-EEE rapist, our CDCs have been as much a joyride they can thanks to this guy.  Bhatta's sarcasm,  amazing humor, English have everyone captivated, and his dashing smile's made so many women (and men) weak in the knees.Guitar, football, pop-culture, CH5, what's he not conquered?  Here's to a lifelong of friendship filled with madness and fun. We'll probably cross paths someday when he's this age's Luis Bunuel or Truffaut, but the one thing I know for sure is that this Dude shall Always Abide.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Arkab. Yes, writing testimonials is very difficult. We first met at Big Break practices, where you were this Bong with all these literary references and intellectual ideals and perfect textbook acting skills... and... all those things are still true. But so many other things also! Three years of adventures and misadventures and fights (and you can only have real fights with real friends, so it's a good thing, I guess.)... these years have been something greater than the sum of their parts, and when you consider the parts, like Black Comedy and Chaar Small and Arrested Development marathons (which we should have had more of... dammit) and conversations in the middle of the night about everything from grammatical pedantry to Elizabethan undergarments to your choice of same-sex prom date... It's really been great. I don't know what you're going to do, what with all your innumerable talents including football and filmmaking and acting and writing and... Well, you'll do something for sure. And I'll be all like, 'Hey! I know Arkab. We wrote half a play together once.'... or one of the many other anecdotes we've generated in BITS. I'll miss you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>
<p>Wololo ! Seriously regret meeting you this late in my BITS life. Maa ki kirikiri. AoE matches or rather the post match discussions have been amazing ! The Velino trips for the want of a better word, have been epic. The pre-farewell bash was real fun.It's been amazing to discover we have so much in common. The Wire, AD, British Sitcoms , Coen Brothers and finally The Angrez. Its been an epic sem with you around and I'm hoping 4-2 will be even more so.

<p>A testimonial long overdue. I won’t start with the clichéd “Oh, where do I begin?” because I know exactly where: this creature has been the single reason behind the ruin of my sleepy, live-and-let-die campus routines. I always wonder what life would have been like had Arka not been in my exam hall for TRW T1 (Frankly, it wouldn’t have been very different – he’d have found something else to screw my happiness with). He’s been the bane of my college life with the humongous amount of case-taking. But then, there’s charm, there’s a prince’s charm, there’s charmander (fire-type pokemon) and then there’s Arka. Despite anything, it’s impossible not to stay friends with this smooth-talking Bong. Love him or hate him, you just can’t ignore the irrepressible charm. And, so, here we are – best friends for the past 3 years since becoming DePP writers’ inductees (FAIL). A prolific writer, literary genius, brilliant actor & orator, prodigious footballer, complete Casanova and the list is too long for me to continue. He’s our group’s pop-culture mentor and has, at once, introduced me to the most brilliant & most disgusting things I’ve ever seen – ranging from Spinal Tap, Office Space, the Office, Monty Python and CID to Lemonparty, Bruno, Bad Yoghurt and what not. When in his element i.e. upon availability of YouTube, he metamorphoses into a video-hunting maniac with an insatiable appetite for the most retarded of them all – which, of course, later become entertainment for us. Arka’s too cool for mainstream tastes – be it music, movies or books. If it’s obscure, Bhatta’s game. He’s my parents’ second crush (and most BITSian females’ first) after Paanini – but that’s only ‘cause they met him much later. In all probability, this genius is gonna end up becoming a big-shot director and forget us (that would make me very happy, indeed). So, here’s hoping we have the most epic time in 4-2 and you don’t shift to Patna…<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Bhatta!. My first friend on campus. All we did in our first year was take either Swapnil's case or go to other friends' rooms and check out their timetable.(:P) Bhatta is a remarkable multi-talented guys, quite different from most Bengalis i've met. A ladies' man, an awesome fotballler and athlete and now a really good AOE player as well (surely a pro by the time i finish writing this). Arka's acting and oratory skills are also worth a mention. Bogmalo trips would never have been the same without you.It has beeen an amazing time with you for the past 3 years and looking forward to Bangalore now.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
