<p>Arpit Goel is a great man. He is a highly responsible person who takes pains to complete his jobs. No doubt he was the coordinator of the Quark Workshops and Guest Lectures, a position he handled with great diligence.

He is a good person who gives really good advices which are practical and worth giving a thought. He is like a complete man with all the qualities. He knows what he is doing, has complete trust on himself and that he will be successful and creates the same aura around him.

I wish him a great and successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most responsible and dedicated guys in the Quark 2012 Coco, Arpit Goyal has been a real inspiration to one and all. With an exemplary work ethic, Arpit has shown incredible passion and dedication, and as the Coordinator of Quark 2012 Workshops and Guest Lectures, he was responsible, for setting up an impressive line-up. With a calm and cool head, and a mature outlook, he is one of the best people to learn from.  Arpit has been a real delight to work with, and I am sure, that with his skills, and outlook towards work and life, he will really go far! All the best for your future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>
<p>Arpit goyal is da man! Super nice and always cheerful, you will feel your spirit lifting by just greeting him :). I have never seen him get angry (except in one VERY justifiable situation) in the three years I have known him. A very humble person, he has a very pragmatic outlook towards life which will help him in the long road ahead. His charisma and wonderful personality has made him probably one of the most well connected people in campus. On top of that he is very hard-working and diligent and does not give up on stuff he sets out to do. I wish him the very best for the long journey ahead and ask that you Stay your innocent, sweet and happy self.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>
<p>I have had the honor of knowing Arpit since I first stepped in  to BITS. Arpit is an extremely hardworking and focused individual. His work for Quark is one example. Always the cool cucumber I personally have never known him to get angry, maybe its becuase of the fine sense of humor he is blessed with.  I wish him luck for all his future endeavors. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shiva-sood">Shiva Sood</a></p>
<p>Arpit 'Goyal' is one of the nicest guys around in our campus . Always talks politely and sincerely and is a very patient listener.Calling him a big Naruto fan will be an understatement. Has a habit of putting weird , sometimes depressing ,  Gtalk statuses and is also quite a famous personality on DC. Worked tirelessly throughout last year for Quark and really did a commendable job . Can really see this guy having a very bright future ahead . Good luck :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/japneesh-singh">Japneesh Singh</a></p>
<p>Goyal a.k.a phodu has been a very good friend since first semester. always willing to help.. listens to everyone and does what he wants... has started writing a blog which i deeply criticize basically due to the content. never attends lectures and is still able to pull off somehow in the end... I really appreciate the amount of hard work and dedication he put in for Quark over these three years.. worked throughout the vacations and all nighters in college to make quark a success.. I cant thank him less for never saying no to me for those evening walks and mongi time :) in short... Arpit is man of passion, hard work, a true friend which i wish will always be with me... All the best for the future and kudos to our friendship. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>Arpit goyal... one of the most simplest guys around... thoughtful..hardworking...kind ... too introvertish.... but still loving..caring and wat not to add... :P And these arent words written... but feelings meant for him... He gives his all to whatever he does... tries to cover up for others mistakes but also scold them for not doing their work... Yaaron ka yaar..... I have had a really great experience working both with and under you... :) And i will miss our night walks that we had.. Though we might walk our separate ways as life goes on... But i will never forget the smiling face of this fellow who did understand me no matter what circumstance it was... and always helped me.. :) Respect to u bro... have nothing more to say... Best of luck for your life ahead... and stay in touch.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankit-jain">Ankit Jain</a></p>

Wishing you all the very best for all you future endeavors btw mujhe bhool na jana and milte rehna jpr mein :P :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ananya-singhal">Ananya Singhal</a></p>
<p>Arpit bhaiyya..!!! I will never be able to tell him how much I love him, how much I am grateful to him. Even if I had a girlfriend, she would know that Arpit will be the most special person in my life. I am not even going to use the words "one of". He is THE most capable coordinator of Quark 2012. He is THE most loving, caring, gentle and sweet person I have known in the campus. He is THE first person I turn to for help or to discuss my personal or professional problems. He is THE person whom I miss if I don't see him for long. He is THE person whose advice I can follow blindly and whom I can trust, with all my secrets, all my strengths and all my weaknesses. Not many people would know this, but he has THE most wonderful of the ideas and he is THE most practical, considerate and mature person. He is completely unbiased and a great judge of people. He is the person whom I respect the most. He has undergone a sea change ever since he became the Workshops Head. He can scold his juniors, but give them some chocolate cake to make them happy also. He is a simple, large-hearted and progressive person.
I knew Arpit from 1-1, he became my friend in 1-2 and my brother in 2-2. Working under him was one of the greatest learning experiences of my life, my most wonderful moments in Controls were with him, and if at all, I am a little capable, its because of him. He taught me how to think, what to think, how to judge, how to lead, how to decide and how to trust. I am simply indebted by his contribution to my life.
February-April 2012 were the most turbulent times in my life and the support that Arpit has given me is simply too much to thank him for. He has always stood by what (or who) he believed in and gone out of his way to accomplish that.
Despite the failure of Graviton and the extremely tough times that he faced in his tenure as the coordinator, he gave his 100% to carry out the most successful array of workshops Quark will see in a long, long time, I don't even need to mention Guest Lectures.
He is so dear to me and I respect him so much, I will always remember his words for my entire life, "dont ever feel low over your methods of doing things, whatever u doing is good better than what we have done for sure!, just here there tweaks reqd nothing else. and i know you will do great! :D"
Arpit bhaiyya, whenever I think about my experiences in campus or working for Quark, you will be the first person I remember. You are the main reason for what I am today and I will never be able to thank you enough for it. Whenever you are away from me, I will always say to myself, "Kaash Arpit bhaiyya yahaan hote". I love you very much, bhaiyya. Best of luck and keep in touch. :-*   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>

<p>Arpit - a fellow rajasthani friend. He is a very simple and humble person. His humbleness is one of the reasons i always called him "tum" throughout..don't remember calling him "tu" :D. He is very hardworking and his hard work was evident from the success of quark 2012. A fellow Naruto and Prince of Persia fan. He truly believes in god, I always hear the sound of him ringing the bell while praying in the evenings, that is seriously something worth following. Three years are less to know a great person like Arpit. I wish you all the best for your future. You will surely achieve what you wish for!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
