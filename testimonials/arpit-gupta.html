<h1 class="page-title">Arpit Gupta</h1><p>*BABA* ... bas itna hi kaafi hai!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sontakke">Vishal Sontakke</a></p>
<p>He is one of the tallest best friends i have ever had. ”A chalta phirta encyclopedia (up to date version) ”   
I guess it was destiny that we met coz we had other branches at bits hyd den we got mech at bits hyd and finally eni here.
He is a very talented. kuch bhi jugaad karke kaam kar lega.
Witty, humourous, cool minded ,helpful and calm guy. He is secretive related to matters of his babagiri.Well; i guess that’s why no one can take your place. He has a good heart. I will be missing all the fifa times that mostly consisted of the shouting ,galli garoj and ofcourse a few goals.
Hope god blesses you with  all the beautiful girls ……..oops shit………
hope god helps you achieve all your life goals and gives you all the happiness.
I do not know why but I think you wud be very funny when you would be high as a kite.
Keep in touch bhai. It has been an amazing  time of my life.

<p>BABA. as we call him. A very silent, cool, humble, humorous and caring person. He is very much for his height. He has good sense of humour. He is a good listener and speaks very less. He always keeps his cool & I have never seen him in tension. I am glad to have known you. I wish you all the best for your all future endevours.. Be in touch.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Truly, *BABA* ... bas itna hi kaafi hai!!!
None of us would be surprised if he turns out to be a secret service agent in disguise (PS: Look at his secret address above). 
Even if you ask him "Baba, Whats there in Mess?", first, you'll have to answer him questions like, "Kyun pooch rahe ho?" ; "Kya kaam hai?" ; "Mujhse kyun pooch rahe ho, why me?" Aces exams sometimes (That too, secretly). Secretly opens up a PS station, secretly makes maggi/soup in room ! 
He has a database full of random details of girls from each and every part of the country. 
Ask him to find out about a girl and give him a small incentive (A condom maybe :P)-you will get her wardrobe, her likes and her whereabouts in return (You might also get her dad's occupation, family type and other details if you get him a lubricated one :P). 
He is a nice guy with a uniquely slow yet amazingly quirky sense of humour. Though he never shows, but he is very witty.
This guy can entertain you on a mere chat. It is always fun to be with him ! 
Keep in Touch!

<p>A really nice guy who always seem so cool and composed. I have rarely seen him getting too much excited or involved in chudaap. Though the only times I got to know him were our trips to Vasco where due to some weird reason we would end up together at Temptations I can still say that he is one of the nicest guys I have ever met. I hope you stay in touch man and all the best for your future. And keep playing FIFA

<p>Baba. Privacy ka misaal! <strong> ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY look into baba's phone and laptop!</strong> The first impression anyone would form about you will surely be "calm, quiet, shy". But, NO! I remember you from the second semester only, you were hardly here in the first one! We had almost same classes, and those were the days when you attended all your classes :D Those EG Assignment solving sessions; the 'looking here and there' in the Bio class \m/ and; getting kicked out of chemistry class :P ; were some of the awesome moments I will always remember! Most of Gtalk chat history is occupied by your chats, thanks to all those out-of-nowhere links: comics, news, you-know-what :D Don't you stop that! <br><br>
Tall, dark, handsome :D , your superb presence of mind and good sense of humor always made everybody enjoy your company. Your vast knowledge about anything and everything has always inspired me, stupefied me! Well, you are aptly named <strong> Baba </strong>!
Keep sharing your knowledge! All the best in all your life's endeavours! Keep in touch! <br><br>
PS: Tell us someday about your sources and your girlfriend! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yachit-mahajan">Yachit Mahajan</a></p>
<p><center> All hail Baba </center> <br>Arpit Gupta. Charan sparsh. If there was something like the Cutting edge research awards, you are the sole undisputed clear winner. Whether it be the vytautas mineral water or that random maldives website or those face book pages or those random picked up pics from the internet to what not.. Simply Babaish / \ One more time… <br> <center> All hail baba</center> <br> To put it in the great Kasab's words "SWD refers to Baba's database" / \  / \.. I will miss those times we used to spend in Niks' room. Will miss all those subtle / \ comments. Will miss that witty humor. Will miss those not-so-awkward-moments when i used to knock knock and you never really opened the door, just keep it ajar, man something is wrong with the synchronization ;).. But on a sincere tone. I find you to be a very calm guy, i have seldom seen you angry. Always composed. I can say that he is not friends with every one, but the ones who are fortunate enough to know and understand this person, know how caring he is. Have never ever seen him saying anything against anyone. Thinks straight and doesn't mind what other do. Minds his own business. Don't take him to be selfish. We were not that great friends in our first year. But then we started knowing each other better (One more reason to thanks our twin-sharing-wife Niks) and I understood how great a guy you are. For all that you have done.. I love you Baba and I will miss you Baba!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
