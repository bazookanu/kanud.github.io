<h1 class="page-title">Arpit Srivastava</h1><p>Arpit was one of the first friends I made in BITS (apparently over a discussion about ID numbers). We spent hours on pointless and ridiculously detailed conversations on an eclectic range of topics- BITS, it’s clubs and departments, Android, Google,electronics, music and whatnot. I found him to be both book-smart and street-smart at times and sometimes completely irrational! All in all, he’s a great guy to talk to and work with (as long as you stay away from his room).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
