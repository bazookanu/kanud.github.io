<p>I came to know Aruj only post 2-2 when we were in the same MT 2 group. He has been a very good friend ever since and he brought life into the otherwise forgettable Chemical classes thanks to his crazy antics. Through him I have learned to be a better listener, a better communicator, more compassionate, more understanding,  nonjudgmental, and just a better person(courtesy our endless fights regarding Sachin, Laxman, Anand etc,P.S I still rate many people above the midget). He has been one of the reasons for me not feeling homesick.He has made my college life enjoyable, unforgettable and purposeful. Even though he is half mad and gets paranoid over the tiniest things (I swear one more time you mention your plight in PDD I will smack you really bad), he has his heart in the right place.  Hope he attains great heights in his life. Cheers!!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/balaaji-mahadevan">Balaaji Mahadevan</a></p>
