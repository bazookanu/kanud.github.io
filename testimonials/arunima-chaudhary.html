<h1 class="page-title">Arunima Chaudhary</h1><p>It is truly said, people who care about you are few in this world, but fewer are the people who will selflessly want good for you. Arunima lies in that category, she can never harm anyone, she will understand you more than you think she knows about you. 
I met her on the train to Delhi (thank god for jaundice outbreak)… I fell for her innocent smile the 1st time I saw her smile. Her self-confidence, welcoming smile and awesome nature really attracts you towards her. I don’t know ,was it destiny or just a co-incedence, but I’m glad I met her and asked her to our 1st prom :D …. Since then she has been with my through all times, holding me when I’m to giveup , supporting me when I need help and sharing all those joyous moments :’) knowing her makes me feel I don’t need to find a better person for me, she is just amazing.. her intelligence is real turn-on factor for me :D I have noticed people share with her a lot, and her capacity to withhold all that information without gossiping(except with me)  is WOW. 
I hope you achieve everything you aim for… world will be at your feet

<p>You're probably the only female in my branch whom i can refer as my frnd. I met you in the 1st year itself n since then its been a great journey with you. You're a great talent and exceptionally brilliant in acads. It was great working with you for SPAM event and having that double cheese burst at Dominos. Thanks for helping me out at every point and also for making my journey through EEE bearable...
Have a great life and a brilliant future...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

Its amazing hw u get along with soo many ppl so quickly. When i look back, there r so many hilarious, fun n time pass moments i can think of.. but the one most clear in my memory is ur bday treat at fisherman's wharf :P... n our amboli  treat cums 2 my mind 2 :|  At times i have seen u in ur mood swings...( thats when i feel u r scary :P )..but luckily they go as fast as they come :) 3 years in bits hv been a roller coaster ride with u Arunima!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saumya-gupta">Saumya Gupta</a></p>
<p>Some friends are made for life. I hope to count you among them :D
Initially, I admit I found you a tad blunt with words .. but even then, admired your candidness . It took me some time to see your other facades but eventually i came to know you as an extremely selfless, caring , considerate , strong and supportive person ,in ways more than one :P ,  with a larger and selfless heart than most :) Not to mention your occasional innanity and zest for fun and life that bring out the child in you :) You can be serious , focused, responsible etc etc but you seldom lose your bubbly happiness :) and i hope you never do. I am grateful to you for being there when i needed a friend. It would have changed my life if you hadn't and that can be said for very very few people in my life .Knowing you has been a joy that I hope shall last.
I am priviliged to have found a friend like you , whom i can trust without restraint, and to be trusted in return is the greatest gift you could give me . In my opinion friends like you are the hardest to find but the easiest to keep
and you I intend to keep :)
tc :)
ps- i'll miss my smiley drawing pad , your watch , and our scuffles :P and i will win someday :P :P thanks for bearing with me all this while (be it waiting for mess, lab reports , and everything else ) :D nd sry for allllll the times u got scraped , stratched , sprained ............ and lastly - * draws on arm - :D :D *.

<p>Arunima is a fun loving, jovial person who has some of the cutest slang in Hindi, which lies within my comprehension :D. With her sweet smile and innocence she became a very good friend to me in a short span of time. She is very considerate, helpful, logical, bold and very sincere to whatever she does. She is adventurous and wants to try out different things in her life. Remember the robotic event we went for in first year, Quark. I'll always cherish those moments we spent creating chaos in that room during the event finally achieving the huge task of placing the bot arena (hmm.. though it didn't move a bit :P).  Arunima, I am glad I got to know you as a friend and I will definitely miss you. All the best for you future! Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>

<p>CHAUDHARYYYYYYYY,
The first time I saw you,in that black t-shirt and wearing a tattoo with a skull on it ...OMG...I was pretty sure you would be bossy ,somebody who will punch you in the face if u messed with her :P .My opinion took a 180 degree turn  the first time I talked to u(though u are very much capable of punching someone :P). I accept I was so jealous of u for getting that room of yours...but tell u wat ..its much more fun to come running from my room ,into yours and stand at the window.Boy,am i gonna miss that :(.Teri playlist udane mein jo maza mujhe aata hai ....wow.A girl who doesn't give a damn to wat the others might think ,who just lives her life according to herself ...balancing everything along the way.I just love that about you.A person who is free in the true sense of the word. :). In these 3 years ,without knowing ,I learnt so much from you...being independent,enjoying my life,doing wat I want to do.If the girl who was Meghna 3 years back would look at me,she would be shocked.A lot of that credit goes to all of you.You are the first person I think of when I need some advice.Tera saath beth kar baat karte karte kab mein 11:30 so jaane wali....3 baje tak jagna sikh gayi.Remeber Mulan...that was the first time I stayed up so late. At the end u people changed me:P. The person who would keep on sitting when u all njoyed celebrating b'days...became part of the fun.:).
Jab agle sem darwaza khol kar bethungi....I'd miss u like hell :(
I want to tell you that you have softest heart I've seen...loves easily,gets hurt easily.Don't be afraid to get attached..don't be afraid to love...we all love u a lot....what place you have in our hearts will never be replaced.
I know you'll shine a lot in the future.Have the most beautiful life ahead....better than the bestest you have imagined :)

<p>There were two girls weeping,standing on the gate of CH5 on the first day of college,as their mothers were leaving,.im talking of myself and arunima(OB its arunima's testimonial and im writing it..), there was my neighbour walking back with me,nd I was even confused! with her name is it anurima?? or arunima?? got it right in a few days :P .........and from then on there was no looking back..she has stood by me or rather STUCK to me for the past three years and will continue to do so forever..Thanx a lot for that...its surprising is that most of the good memomries of my college life has you in it!!!!!writing anything for you is quite difficult because it seems im just writing about myself...the mood swings,choti-choti baat par bura manna,aata-jaata gussa etc, you seem so like me but yet so different..we have gone through a lot,our worlds have literally revolved around each other..saath mein padhna,watching sharukh muvies in between compre,mimickry,hamara ultimate tp,being a pain in each other's ass, irritating u ,(nd vice versa :P :P ),late night philosophical talks ..and then you falling asleep on my bed(like u always do..:O).She is one friend im lucky to have..she'll  be there behind me(not because of the diffrence in our sizes :P ) in any situation,she gets tensed when i am and all cheered up when im happy,was MY only vegetarian friend(not anymore) who loves to eat..U just have to tell her ki arunima yeh karne ka mann kar raha hai nd she makes sure that happens or atleast will try her best to. ..she even understands wat i dnt say(all the non verbal cues)...gives in to lot of my baseless demands too.Has always tried to make all my bday's special( :D :D).She has taught me to stay up late,to leave certain things on tym,to take li8.She gets a little too critical about things,bottles up a lot of emotions inside her  and thats probably the time i find kind of hard to deal with...we have had our share of fights too,there have been times i was hard on you...some of them really really stupid(u fight with only those whom u love and care about).thats past and forgotten .but even after the glitches our bond has only grown stonger and as we are moving on,that doesn't mean its over...some people are just a part of u..ur one them....hameshaa and forever....love youuu... :-* :-* :-) :-)

<p>Arunima the dudette. Hmmm. 
Shes shrewd, practical and knows what she wants. She will go after it and she will nail them all. :D that’s Arunima in a sentence for you guys. Ever so happy, jovial and fun loving.  She has a knack for knowing people, she knows people. Like, really know them. 
Now that the last of my engineering nightmares is over, I know this is not the end my dear, (that would have been a shame, i kind of suck at saying good byes) its the beginning of an era! Jashn Shuru Kiya Jaaye!
Ps:  Yes all your accusations are true, I never came out of my room in the first year. And if it weren’t for you guys it would have stayed that way for a long while. Love you loads for that!

<p>When i first saw you, amidst the chaos of admission, in our first year, i thought "Who is she? Is she a senior? She stands a foot above everyone else... and with a tattoo...she looks scary. I better stay away from her." And that was supposed to be the end & i was never to see you again. So i was very surprised when i saw that you lived only a door away from me. "Huh?? She wasn't a senior?? And she lives a door away from my room? How embarassing... :P" But after i talked to you a little, i realised you weren't scary at all... infact you were so friendly, that i wanted to become your friend. But since i was so shy back then, i couldn't pluck up the courage to talk to you. And so passed a year and i still didn't know much about the girl across-from-next door. It was only in 2nd year that i really got to know you... As fate would have it, we became "dishtant" branch cousins and by 2-2, we became partners-in-suffering-all-the-hardships-of-being-in-EEE/I. I know i annoyed you a lot with my countless idiotic doubts...("Why do you ask so many questions!!?" you would exclaim in exasperation :P) Remember how i would get all hyper when we studied together? The whole corridor could tell when we hit the books together... all the screaming(mostly done by me) & screeching(again mostly by me) & the endless fits of giggling(remember MuP? & CAS?) All hell breaks loose when you & i are put in the same room... We just canNOT keep our hands off of each other for long can we? Remember all the times you (falsely) accused me of sexual harrassment??(Well wats a girl to do when you tempt her so..? Damn you & your sexy legs!!) And remember all the times you so generously let me doodle on you or kick you...just to satisfy my violent tendencies... Where would i direct all my wild energy without you? I'm gonna miss you my punching bag :'( I have a burning question in my head!!! HOW IN THE WORLD do you survive without drinking water!!! Are you a camel?? Do you have a hump somewhere in your body to store water?? I'm gonna tell your mom that you drink 2 DAYS OLD stale water!! Oh yes i will! You are my favourite biting pad(? can't find the right word)... but somehow you ALWAYS know when i'm about to go on one of my biting sprees...and you somehow always manage to slip away...Why won't you just let me bite you darn it! I feel so "unsatisfied" when i can't bite you... So PLEASE, let me bite you for 6 months worth before we leave!!! Here i come CHAUDARY REDDY NAIDUUUUU!!! (GOD! i love that name)

P.S: i will miss talking in wierd made up accents with you :P :* :* :* myax!

<p>Arunima = Phodu! Phaadu CG , god in all eee cdcs, although we got to know each other only in the third year, its been good fun all the same. Comsys devi has also been invaluable help in acads, ever ready to help, one can ping her anytime for portions/codes/reports. One of the very few people i know who're genuinely interested in electrical engineering, this lady is surely going to make it big. All the best for the future.
