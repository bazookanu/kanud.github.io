<h1 class="page-title">Arushi Gupta</h1><p>Arushi is one of the best friends I have ever had. We have known each other since the very beginning of our time at BITS and the last 3 years, as she once said, have been like one long conversation. Some of the most wonderful moments that I have had over here have been in her company - Master the Market, my first MATRIX event, CIMA - and I'm certain that there are many more to come. We have been together in almost every group project and assignment and when I leave BITS, not having her around to help me out will make things very difficult.

Arushi is awesome _/\_ She's beautiful, smart, intelligent and has a great sense of humour. During the last 3 years, she has also been improving her remarkable abilities and growing in confidence all the time. It has been a pleasure having her around. She has an adventurous side to her persona that can put most guys to shame. I haven't seen many girls play football better than her. She dances pretty well, has good taste in music and amazing artistic abilties. She has worked on some memorable exhibits for arts and deco.

Arushi is a wonderful person. Genuinely very nice. She's very sincere when it comes to work and you can always depend on her if you need any kind of help. She's honest, social, gels with people easily and is great fun to hang out with. She cares a lot about her friends and I consider myself very fortunate to have known her. All the best! I'm certain that you are going to do very well. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Arushi - What should I say about her..In precise words, we both are synonyms. She is my bestest friend with whom I share my heart and soul. She has inspired me beyond limits with her self-confidence, dedication, determination and never say no attitude. I have grown as a person in her company and am really grateful to her for being my friend and always there for me whenever I needed her. All my adventures in BITS has been with her :P :P All those crazy moments, shopping streaks, late night talks, stalking :P and much more will always remain with me. I wish her all the success in life :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>I thought girls are complicated. But then i thought with the level of my understanding of things, shouldn't be a prblm with me. But then i came to know about arushi. Not trying to imply that she is complicated but sometimes you might end up thinking "what is she doing?" or "Why is she doing that?" but then the best thing to do would be to mind your own business and let her do what she wishes coz thats what she is, a free bird who just does what she wishes to do. She's been very helpful and a great little sis for the past 2 years. Correcting me when required, encouraging me all the time and listening to me when i needed someone to hear me out (pretty much every time). We have had our share of special moments, fun moments, serious moments, sometimes not so good moments and total random moments as well. But almost all of them are the ones that i will remember always. "Jalebi" is the name i gave to her coz i believed she is as straight as a jalebi :P. You are a very special person dear, may you get all the love and success that you wish for. Thank you so much for everything that you did for me, I will never forget that. All the best for your life ahead. God Bless!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>I have known Arushi since well before we were slated to come to BITS: I have known her for over 15 years now. I have seen her interact with practically thousands of people; thousands, and something that all of us have in common, is admiration. An admiration for how strong she is, how level-headed she is, how smart she is, and how she pulls off being that way, with the grace that needs to be practiced for years. I have seen her evolve from the tomboy that everyone knew her as at school, into a beautiful young woman, who is best described in the words of a mutual non-BITS acquaintance: "With Arushi, I don't even have to look at her face. I don't have to look at her body. She has a charm, a strange charm in her ways, and that is enough. She is beautiful. I don't know if she is pretty, but she is beautiful!" I believe he was right. We've known each other very long, and it is time now to part our ways, probably for good. I will miss having such a familiar face around, and hope with all sincerity, that you succeed in whatever you do, and have a very fulfilling life. Bless you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tuhin-sah">Tuhin Sah</a></p>
