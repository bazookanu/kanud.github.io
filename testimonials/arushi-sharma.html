<h1 class="page-title">Arushi Sharma</h1><p>Hey Arushi. I think it’s been almost 14 years since we’ve known each other. Apart from the time me and my parents came to Jaipur earlier, but I was just a little kid then, and thus have no memory of it. You’ve always been great to hang around with, even back then, but I had much more fun since the time I’ve known you here. I think we became friends here after an year of me coming here, in my 2-1, till then we’d been just acquaintances. You have a knack of appreciating the finer things in life (well, food at least), even though you’re not normally too experimental. And also fun loving as well as sometimes paranoids, two traits which generally don’t go well together. It’s been nice knowing you all these years, and I hope our friendship continues in the future too. Ciao.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-bhatt">Chaitanya Bhatt</a></p>
<p>Daru!!!! (Used to call you that atleast :P) Where to begin? I know you won't like me saying this again but yes i really did think you were Shivi and she was you at first. Yeah i put attendance for you two but those days are looooong gone now (that got all 3 of us Cs so good riddance)... What exactly is attendance i should say now and really thank you and your notes for not being ACB :P so, what i did was really minor in comparison :) We have gone a long ways since then i guess, "my wife"! You really are a true girl next door and the longest lasting close friend i've ever had :') You are a brilliant person and an even better friend and though you are pretty realistic, after some thought it does make sense and seems right and you show off but it's totally fine :P (sorry haaad to put that). Kudos to your story telling skills, they have made many afternoons of mine interesting. I can never forget your expressions, you truly give the most entertaining reactions :D I'll really miss all the laughing and crying and fooling around we have done and i hope that i get PS2 in Bangalore (fat chance of that happening but i can still dream right ;)) and we can partaayyyy!!! Also, thanks for always hearing me out even though i have been ear wrenching loud. You covered almost everything :-/ not fair, i don't have much more to say! Long live the Arushi Case-Take Brotherhood! Hope to never loose you. Love you :-* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>
<p>Arushi! As I sat down to write this testimonial, I didn’t know where to start. Not because I don’t have anything to write but because I’ve got simply too much. So without further ado, I’ll start:
I first met you here on campus in my first year. You probably don’t remember this, but you and Kriti were a part of a big group who ragged me and some others within a week of me coming here. Nothing much, you guys just made me count all the trees on the road in front of my hostel, which were 28, by the way. Still, I had fun. 
At the risk of sounding highly dramatic, fate could have left it there, and we would have lived in the campus with the obliviousness of not knowing each other…but it had other plans. We met again as a part of DoSM. Our interaction for the first year was mostly of an acquaintance level only. In my second year however, you became my mentor in the media team and I started reporting directly to you. Our interaction increased and consequently I realized what a gem of a person you are. Though there was some junior-senior camaraderie between us initially, I would like to believe that we quickly became fast friends. You had an easy going attitude about you that endeared you to almost all your juniors. This past year, working with you was awesome. You were a brilliant mentor and loads of fun to hang around with. I would especially like to thank you for believing in me when no one else did. You gained no friends, rather lost many, while standing up for me when you didn’t have to. This may sound cliché, but believe me, this is right from the bottom of my heart; you are the one who taught me to stand up for what I believe in, no matter what. Even when the odds were insurmountably stacked against you, you held firm. You were out-numbered and outgunned but never once did you waver in your unflinching support. For all this and more, I am eternally grateful. There are a very few people on campus who hold the distinction of fighting and shouting themselves hoarse outside CC and CH-2 and god knows how many other places. None of them are girls I believe, except you that is. My only regret is that I wasn’t there to watch this shouting match (with popcorn). Still, keep up your fighting spirit, this never say die attitude, and I’m sure no one will ever have the guts to mess with you. It has been a pleasure knowing you, working with you, for you and basically just being around you.  
I summarize in just one line: Arushi, I respect you immensely for your skills as an exceptional mentor and treasure you greatly as a genuine friend. And as this is the farewell testimonial, I would like to wish you the best of luck on all your future endeavors.

<p>Arushiiiiiii !! Kahan se shuroo karun !!! As you said, we had known each other for some two years ?!! Working in DoSM, sharing a few classes, meeting in beaches occasionally, it all seemed enough back then, didn’t it? I didn’t know how wrong I was. It just took 55 days to change that!! Oh wait, it wasn’t 55, it was the very first couple of days of PS in Bangalore that I knew I would have a ball there. It was fate I say, that all of us chose HAL in the last day without even thinking who would be there or who would not. Thanks to you I could go to Xtreme, Casa Piccolo, Enigma HRC, Amoeba, Harem café…and places I don’t even remember names of (Kriti was so freakin’ jealous that we could stuff our faces with the best food around). Who else would I have dragged there? Who else would have bunked PS with such eagerness? Who else had gone to Bangalore with none but one purpose (to partayyy)? However bad the day at Commercial Street may have been it was still better any day with you not there. From fighting with rickshaw drivers to faking my age at club entrances, from watching Delhi Belly (you for the second time) to singing in public buses and harassing the crowd, from eating at the fanciest of places to going in a hunt for the cheapest of the Punjabi dhaba (and we found the best food at the creepiest of corners :P), I can’t even begin to articulate how much “pagalpanti” we did in those few days. How a junior hoped without success that he could talk to a sane Simi Aluwalia; the way you talked with him still cracks me up. I will always miss the post-corner-house walk, the time at pico’s, your endless hate for Jaggayyapet, and the time you left for Hyderabad. At the very least you were right there, for everything and always have been since then. It’s really great to know that you always got my back! We will pakka meet in PS and that too in Bangalore because I think there’s no other city that’ll ever feel the same way and capture the true sense of our friendship.
Hoping that we can recreate such times again
With love, always =)

<p>Okay, So I have like no Idea when we met first.  But knowing you has been one interesting experience. Can't thank you enough for selling me newspapers, refusing to be the love of my life and most importantly your GAN Notes [E to D]. This DoSM Media Coordinator is the perfect balance between Immense Maturity and Childishness. From being an 8P, doing SOPs under BDM to awesome night outs andgetting drunk out of senses, she's done it all. I'll always remember the trip to Club Cubana, German Bakery, Curlies, Hilltop, you stopping at that Medical Store [;)] and most importantly Your Brilliant Smile. The Louis Vuitton ? You'll get one for sure. Stay in touch. Always be the way you are! [Inspire ki ab toh treat De De!]<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>I had been acquainted with you since 1st year but i got to know you more in 2-2 as we were in the same MT-2 group, and damn i used to be so jealous of you because of the way you would impress all MT-2 instructors, knowing that one of them(electronics one) literally hated me :P. And then Maths CDC's,you have always managed getting good grades , without being regular to classes and having fun throughout the year. That's really inspirational :D. I really admire the way you manage things in your life ,not letting anything affect the other and your philosophy in life- to have ultimate fun :D. Good to know you. All the best for your future! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>
<p>Arushi! there is soo muchto write, where doI start from. Phew, I have known you since 1-1. We talked a bit and then somehow it was you giving me advice and then somehow it was those long gossiping sessions and never-ending talks. Arushi, you are one of the most sincere and genuine people I have known. It is fun to be with you. It is fun taking your case and taking cases with you. You take all the zokes in stride and just keep flashing that amazingly cute smile. :). You are a real sweetheart and can't just ever be rude somehow. No matter how many times I have hit on you, you have always rejected my advances but very politely. :P. You are really helpful and have always given me all the maths notes which you so beautifully write :P ( your writing is awesome). Arushi, I dont think my college life would have been complete without knowing you. All the make - up, dressing up and all that shit! fuck! :) I remember the last sem - end Club Cabana and all that jazz! Man it was fun, and that blue dress we bought! :). It has been great knowing you. You are a greaaaaat! friend, an amazing person and an absolute joy to be with. Thanks for all the support and all the times you have patiently listened to all my crap. :) Love you loads. We obviously will stay in touch. Hoping the best for you always and wishing you all the happiness in the world :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>
<p>One testimonial isn't enough for someone as Interesting as you. So here comes Testimonial Part 2. Posing as the hunk from DCE trying to Buy your love, or as the random First yearite trying to subscribe to Magazines other than the Indian Express or Talking about Flash Lights, It's been one hell of an experience trying to irritate the crap out you. And I totally appreciate the fact that you took all the pranks and weird texts in the Fun Sense it was meant to be in. Keep Smiling =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>In line with the usual way of starting a testimonial, I'm going to say "Where should I begin??". :P
So with Arushi, I think its most appropriate to start from the beginning...the beginning of life in college. We were practically conjoined at the hip in our first sem. We took on everyone and everything together back then! She's as impulsive, adventurous and fun as they get. And I've had some of my best college memories with her which if I start recounting now, would take all day. We started college with a bang for sure! :P
Even today, every time we get together, there's always that comfort in knowing that we share so much history. The long walks and talks that we've had, not to mention living one door apart from each other, were the first time I got close to someone in such a short time. She's been crowned the 'gossip queen' of our batch and there's always something new and interesting to be discussed every time I drop into her room. Along with Kriti, Gauri and Syal, I think our 'corridor escapades', regular bottle filling routines and insane discussions made hostel life that much more interesting!
We've got another year to go together and big plans for EEE, so this isn't goodbye. There's so much more to come. :)
Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivi-anand">Shivi Anand</a></p>
<p>Arushi! The only person I knew when I came to BITS. You showed me around, and well the first day of college or Day 0 lets call it, you took me to Bogmalo ahhh and there it began. Arushi is sooooo much fun to be around. And I do remember people making fun of how "alike" we were (startig from hair to posing for pictures). Of course whenever I need to know what I am going to do next year I should just ask Arushi what she is doing, I'll be somewhere around that next year. :D And to be specific I remember this certain trip once when we were supposed to be uhm uhm elsewhere. hahahha too much fun! I don't think I would have known half the people or places here had I not known you also wouldn't have known the magical liit...and of course to end with I hope you get to all of those things (you know I have vested interest here :P)

<p>Even though we live in the same corridor, I got to know her through our common friend, Ranjita. She is one pretty chick whose wisecracks always manage to leave you in splits. You won’t realize how time flies in her company because she always has these amazing anecdotes to share.  A wonderful orator. Extremely sensible and mature, you can always hope to get good advice from her. A connoisseur of food and drinks, she has been my guide to all must-visit places in Goa. It’s been a pleasure getting to know you. All the best for the future!
P.S. I always wondered how you manage to write so fast. Love your handwriting :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-dhoot">Shruti Dhoot</a></p>
<p>There's this episode of some sitcom I once saw where the protagonist had to go somewhere and he says all his goodbyes too early, and then he keeps running into the people he bid farewell to, and it basically gets really awkward cuz he's not going anywhere for quite a while. My sem's been so full of you, and thank God for that, without you I'd have died a little in PABM (btw, I owe you that grade). But apart from that too, it's always wonderful having you around, you somehow always know if I'm in the mood to gossip or whine about life or talk senti shit, and you always say the right things =) 
 You were a great fake mother-in-law, and you're a brilliant person. Stick around, woman, it's always crazy having you around =D
And I'm not going to go on a rant on how awesome I hope your life gets, cuz I'm coming up next sem. Life already just got better! Picture abhi baaki hai, mere dost ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayeesha-khanna">Ayeesha Khanna</a></p>
<p>Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?

Its been 533 Days, 13 Hours and approximately 44 Minutes since the day I first saw You and life has never been the same again. I always knew that we'll never end up together and I could never even gather the courage to tell you how I feel about you but then I could never let it go. Monginis, the place where it all began. You were sitting with your friends, wearing that awesome smile of yours totally making me fall in Love with you. I know, its not your fault that I couldn't control my emotions and fell in love but you can't blame me either, You were just the most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my life. The Green Eye Make Up, the Hair and just everything about you is so Brilliant that I just don't have words to describe. And the shorts you've started wearing of late. But the happiest moment of my life was not when I saw you for the first time, it was when I realised that you were in Mathematics and I'd get to spend a whole year with you. Sadly, you did not attend all those lectures, but I did, hoping to see you atleast in a few of those. The time just flew by and its time for a GoodBye! I'll miss you just as I have every moment in the last 533 days when you were away from me. In all my life, I have never really felt so at peace as when I could see you. I was enthralled by the beauty of your smile, bewitched by the twinkle in your eye. You affected me in ways I never thought existed. There will always be a place in my heart where you'll always be fondly, fondly remembered. I wish you the brightest future and hope you find all that you are looking for.

<p>Ok, finally I am writing testimonials. Guy, gays and Gals....presenting to you a girl who was the first consolation of realistic attitude I saw in this campus when the campus was just looking like a whorde of pretentious beasts who either spent time appreciating themselves imagining themselves to be the Chanakya off the age. Met her first in C mess, and just with the choice of movies we opted for, I knew "Damn, this chick's good :P" <Bhati calm down>
First girl I knew who had seen Shawshank, she has been my primary resource o gossip at every level. Her resources emanate sheer brilliance macha! We had worked together for a year or so and she genuinely appreciates the efforts in hard, sincere and non-bakchod work. One of the few girls who dares to give a finger to extreme chauvinism of campus, she has been a delight to talk to every time. Bogmalo ke sutta se leke utorda ke daaru tak, har joint ki kasam, yaar you will go a long way because of the sheer reason that you trust your instincts beyond anything. Macha, I will always be there for people like you who made campus a m****r f*****g, mind thumping, ass numbing, soul enlightening, and heart pounding affairs for me.......
