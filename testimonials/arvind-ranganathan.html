<h1 class="page-title">Arvind Ranganathan</h1><p>The most organized person I know in BITS. Pro at arts, smart, enthusiastic movie and TV series viewer, chilled tambrahm, perfectionist and very hard working. Amazing friend, my PS1 project partner and great guy to hang out with :D  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>A great artist coupled with Arvind's perfectionist attitude made him one of the best coordinators of Arts and Deco, and his team's efforts truly showed in all the three fests. Apart from that, Arvind is not only a very kind and generous human being but also one of my dear friends who is caring and helpful always and will remain a friend for life. He always strives to be better than his previous self, which is a quality worth appreciating. Keep up the good work Arvind, never change yourself for anyone ever and most importantly, keep smiling and be happy. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>As we call him... "the mummy of Arts n Deco" - Arvind is real leader. A very responsible person with whom you can just stay 'relaxed' (kyunki tension lena mummy ka kaam hota hai :D)
He has only one love of his life - "Coke hai sada ke liye..... " #CokeIsNothingLessThanDiamonds
A very considerate, straight forward and hardworking (workaholic :P) Person. You can never regret being around him ... unless he is forcing you also to work of course :P
Kuch buri aadatein bhi hai - jaise hamesha time par aana, har class jaana, and Coke kisise na share karna :D ... but you cannot help missing him when he is not there. Ultimate combination of organised work plus fun.
Best of luck Arvind ji .... I know you will have a great Future \m/ - BITS is just a beginning :)

<p>The sincerest n the most hardworking friend I've ever had!  Can be very stubborn at times, but he never once stood up for something wrong. To all in our corridor, he's a man of principles!
He's been  my best buddy on campus and has stood by me during difficult times!!  
He has n will always be the good guy!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>The best Arts&Deco co-ordinator! Workshop labs were a breeze with this guy-he simply loved sidestepping the 'Workshop Rules' by you-know-who, and always talked his way out of things. An artist to the core.--Arvind is a very sincere person (and innocent, of course). All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>At initial meets he sounded like a really eccentric fellow who was really stuck-up about a few trivial things. I was in for a surprise. This is one great guy who really knows his way around his stuff. Amazingly talented, coupled with sheer diligence and the desire to stand out from the rest make him a truly awesome personality. Extremely humble, never will you find him looking out for appraisal for his phenomenal efforts, be they on the canvas (which are the stuff of legends in BITS now), his writing skills or on the academic front (the only guy i guess who has an ascending CG slope throughout). 'Perfectionist' best describes him and he is one person who is who he 'says' he is. His penchant for Coke is well-known and  him wailing about "sacrificing his dear coke for paintbrushes owing to lack of funds" never fails to make me burst out in laughter. He is one great guy to hang out with and somehow will always make you smile with his jokes no matter how lame they maybe. Arrogance, the term he knows not for he is always helpful at all hours. Happened to learn a lot from him, hope he only stays the way he is. Though these are our last few days together, I sincerely hope we remain friends forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>If you were to attribute a coin to Arvind, then it's two sides would be passion and sincerity. His creativity and artistic talents are one of the best on campus and under him AnD has put up the most amazing Central Lawn figures I have seen in the last three years. Our mutual obsessions with Coke, food and TV series has made our friendship special and I hope it continues to remain so for a long time.
Best Wishes!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>Errvind....#$**#....hmmm...no matter what nonsense people will do or how many cockroaches are found or however costly it is, arvind is and will always be a die hard shahi darbar fan who lives, sleeps, studies and works with a coke in his hand. But still, we are the "mess" buddies.
He is also an emergency stationary shop for me  :P

He is a very good artist at heart with good creativity and knowledge. He was also the Arts n deco chief co and is a great fan of various tv series' and movies. A man with very strict principles, who just would do anything to abide with them and stick to them. He is man with good character who will come out to help when needed. I admire the way he keeps himself organized all throughout the semester, no matter how much is the work load. A \m/ night out buddy to hangout with..!!!

Best of  luck for your future...!!!  :)

<p>Arvind!! an awesome guy, a great friend and a really good sport when you make fun of him and his habits. We cracked many jokes in our time together and had a lot of fun. At heart, a really simple guy with a good heart. I wish him all the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>Arvind is an extremely creative and talented artist. I have always seen him calm and composed. He is very sincere. He is a master of Mech softwares. He always used to help me when we did MED together. He has done a great job as a co-ordinator of Arts and Deco. I wish you all the best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>Arvind Mr.Ranganathan .. The time we spent were real memories in Arts and D . Arvind is a combination of Tradition and innovation.Member DOPY, ARTSND, DOSM - All highly work intensive 'departments'. He is one person who I'm sure will ascend great heights with his near perfectionist attitude wherever he goes.He is one of the very few guys on campus who keep their rooms Sparkling Clean ! ;) Very responsible and dedicated person. All the best to you Arvind ! :)  Finally .. Work is Worship , Duty is ARVIND :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Arvind- the chief co :) He is a very hardworking, creative and a talented person. Known him from arts and deco dept, mechanical dept, I am pretty sure that he will attain great heights with all the qualities he possesses. He, along with ramani, should be the Brand ambassadors for Coke. A real simple person with a big heart, I wish him all the best for his life :)  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>The sincerest n the most hardworking friend I've ever had! As is the quality of creative people, emotions are predominant in him and that is the only thing that really stands a chance to stop him from doing something! A true professional on all counts and a passionate workaholic! He can handle just anything! Of course, an idle mind is just not something he can handle. :P
To all in our corridor, he's a man of principles. Everyone respects his stance and impeccability is his attribute in everything he does. He is what I would call as an interesting package sans negativity! He can assert himself and stand his ground in any situation and be tough and pour his heart out alike, when the situation so demands. It took me quite some time to realize how much we shared in common and that eventually, made us the thickest of friends! :)
He's been my best buddy on campus and has stood by me during the most difficult times and he has always let me speak my mind out n loosen up myself! A perfect friend! One thing that I've tried hard to learn from him, is his independent way of thinking, which for some reason hasn't been my forte! :P
He cares a lot and naturally loves to be cared back! He has n will always be the good guy to everyone wherever he goes!  A true leader in character and an epitome of benevolence!
Will miss you BIG TIME Arvind!!  Go rock the world!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Acha ! If you are hungry or in need of stationery rush to his room and you shall get what you want at times coke or tang just comes complimentary. 
His room pics were shared and those pics are memories - Acha Bachke ka room ! 
He's been the perfect chap who used to crib a lot about acads at start but then he started phodufying his Mech Subjects with movies SHAHI food and what not ........
A guy who weighs not less than 150kgs, he was one of the most working and lovable Chief Coordinator. He been that friend who helps you solve problems, gives you the ideal guidance and provides the confidence to face situations. I remember him shouting on me to study and concentrate on academics but then I was a stupid crazy chap who loved to have fun and masti more . Those trips we had will always be a memory coz of various reasons ( he doesnt like to walk and cribs a lot if made to walk - Panjim Guru's Bday treat ).
He has stood for a change and he has showed and pwned his opponents with his good work in all the three fests. Be it being friendly to juniors or voicing his views in CoCo, he been the perfect chap. I remember him getting irritated with the politics in Department system, but then he gave it a thought for days and stood for himself and worked like an ass.

His room shall be duely missed with those artistic things hanging and drawn on room walls. Even his timetable is so decorative ! 
He is that perfect momma's bouy who sleeps early gets up early, finishes work on time eats daily , doesn't smoke or drink and sticks to his principles may what the situation be. 

Be the same macho man you are ( decrease some weigh , dont give that inspiration to ur kids) and stick to your principles always. 
'Size Matters' - Arvind's tagline .
Get a good PS station and get food for me.

I wish you good luck for future and hope you achieve what to aim for. Go get drunk on Bogmalo atleast once before leaving campus, dont miss this opportunity. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Arvind... Chief coordinator of Arts n Deco 2011-12.... If we say that the club works hard... then the coordinator works harder.... Managing your studies with such a great responsibility must be really really difficult, but you managed it well and came out with flying colours... taking r10d to a different level, giving us spectacular fests... _/\_... Organized, creative, friendly and helping... wow... all the best buddy.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>I met this crazy little (:P) thing during Arts n Deco trip to Benaulim. A tall, serious looking fella who actually went straight away to buy coke after getting down from bus.(He can't share his coke with anyone, ask him for a sip and he will actually go and buy another one for himself :P) My first reaction on meeting him was that how can a person be so serious? :P :P I thought a guy like him must b full of attitude but it didn't took me long to realize that how wrong I was. With all the fun we had during that trip we became good friends.

All those late night work for Arts n Deco wouldn't have been so much of fun without you. The chats which we three (Archana, me and you) used to have on different things ,the crazy photo session which we always have during every occassion(remember that epic photo :P :P) will surely be missed.  Loved working with you during Quark'11 on that robot painting.

Sometimes he may be rude but then that is all forgiven when he treats you :P :P. He is expert in writing long mails(many people may have got it :P :P)

The thing which I like about him the most is that how can a person manage it all, member of 3 Deptt and 1 club( during 2nd yr), acads, blog( if you haven't read it.. you should), chief co of the biggest Deptt on campus and yet can have time for friends, movies and tv series. 

The person who can scold you, shout at you for stupid reasons, taunt you for unnecessary things and  still be the one who cares about you at the end of the day. 

Call him fat and the reply comes " I am sexy and I know it :P ".

I wish you all the best for your future.

<p>If I ask Robustness, Leadership, Hard-work, Determination and Perseverance to personify themselves, they probably all will give us Arvind bhaiyya individually and as a whole, both. From getting the work done by the "nab junis" and "lazy sub-juniors" to managing the merry circus which is blissfully called Arts N Deco, he did it all and did it well. While most people would get exhausted and would almost give it all up, encumbered with so many responsibilities, he would handle everything in a very cool manner and like I said before, " get the work done". Once he leaves the campus, he will sorely be missed by each and every Arts N Deco member and by the people who knew him personally or through working with him and getting astonished by his amazing work ethics. I wish him good luck for the future and hope that he achieves success in all his endeavors. 
P.S. I have never really seen him crazy about Coke. :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ateendra-sharma">Ateendra Sharma</a></p>
<p>u are the person with whom i shared a lot of laugh 
and u shared " COKE " (yes bhaiya did shared coke :D)

after that i came to know abt ur acads OMG
how can u manage that much
u manged everything  very well 
JAI CHIEF CO<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arnab-nandy">Arnab Nandy</a></p>
<p>he has had a such a long list of testimonials written for him, i probably have nothing to add! 
a great guy in the true sense, of what i have seen, he's the most organised and disciplined lad i have met so far in the campus. still remember how stunned was i when i visited his room once in the first sem and saw his colorful time table and a daily schedule etc. 
he was a great help in letting us win Zephyr, with his participation in almost all major events.
hes sulky at times, but his dedication for his friends and his art just leaves you awestruck. 
he has his own unique(flamboyant) body language, and he doesn't give a damn to what people think what about him.
his dedication and leadership could be seen in, what i can proudly say, the best of Arts n Deco in all the three fests of 2011-12. 
keep it up Arvind, and pleeeease stay in touch :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>Of all the people I have met, interacted and befriended till now in campus, this one is unique and very special. "The man of the corridor", Arvind has been a household name of AH4. Those early days in campus (when I was very sincere :P) will always remain in my memories where this tall and well-built stature would emerge fresh from the bathroom as early as 5:00 in the morning (??), when I would just be out of the bed, contemplating a bath. The pristine order this guy maintained and that room of his (of which I could only manage to get glimpses from outside) is way beyond the scope of my vocabulary!! I have always wondered could anyone in this world be so sincere and dedicated as this guy and over that TOP so many courses he himself would have lost the count of. I shall always remember those GOOD old TRW (which he eventually TOPPED) days where I was indeed privileged to be a part of the same group of his (and Viggy, of course). He always lead from the front and ensured by all means that we were way ahead of schedule, even to an extent of taking our beloved team-lead (Vignesh) to task :D. His well-deserved co-ordiship of Arts 'n' Deco is a testament to this fact. A great leader, principled man, highly organized and indeed an excellent friend. Thanks for sailing this wonderful voyage with me and making it very special, which I shall always cherish. I see a bright career ahead of you. May the gods be with you and may be blessed with all success and happiness in life. Farewell, and do keep in touch..! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>A person with inborn creativity which is reflected right from the arrangement of his desktop icons to his distinguishing style of artwork which made him the coordinator of Arts 'n' Deco. As a member of five departments in his 1st and 2nd year, he would manage to allot time for studies and get the maximum benefit out of it in the midst of his busy schedule. His imposing stature is complemented by his signature smile and is always entertaining to talk to. A highly principled, organized, humble and affable guy who surely would achieve greater heights in his life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Arvind is a very simple person. A man of discipline & principles. Very hard working also. His smile is just awesome. Had a complete semester of fun with him in POM class :D . Will always cherish those moments. Can never forget that "Moooooooooooo" :P . All the best for your future brother !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>Arvind, or Arvindo as I sometimes call him is one of those PROs who ace in exams without attending classes (like a boss!! :P) A perfectionist at heart, his craving for perfection can be seen in his drawings/paintings, not to forget the rainbow colours that one would find in his notes, with each colour symbolising... well, something :/ :P Discipline is one of the many other virtues that he can be crowned an ambassador of. He may not be regular to class, but when he is, he's generally the first. A great friend and a trustworthy person, he's one of those few people I don't mind giving my notes to, no matter when. Wish you all the very best for your future. Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-balakrishnan">Siddharth Balakrishnan</a></p>
<p>Arvind is one of the few friends whom i have known since first sem. He is a very rare combination of Sincerity, intelligence, diligence and honesty.Arvind is also great artist,he has been the arts and deco Chief co-ordinator for the past year and has done an outstanding job.His efforts contributed immensely in the success of all the three festivals. When it comes to the dinner table, arvind always has a bottle of coke besides him(he is a coke addict :P).He is a PRO at CAD sofwares like PRO E and ANSYS.Although, i really enjoy the Mangement vs Technical debate tht we always have in hostel, i truly believe that Arvind is a person who has the calibre of being a very successful manager who also has exceptional technical skills.I wish u a happy and prosperous future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sukrut-mhatre">SUKRUT MHATRE</a></p>

<p>Evidently ppl love you! So many testimonials precede mine..... All about you has been dissected and discussed above... Coke addict, Awesome Coordinator, Dependable, Trustworthy, Mech God, Creative, Witty, Charming, Organized, Disciplined......the list goes !! From my experience, what I have observed that this guy has a very practical approach to life and does not believe in any fancy stuff. I often fly high with my impractical idealistic idealoogies and this guy "shoots" them to bring them to ground. I owe you a lot for that. Eating in mess with him has been an amazing experience and had the most laughs at absolutely random things. This guys obsession with Coke often gets on my nerves and once I cooked up some story of him being a cold blooded capitalist just to rob him the wrong way :P Dramebaaz guy, If u wanna do random TP (exams/fests not looming ahead) just catch hold of this guy and bore him. Inspite of the all the praises he may get, for me this guy is still underapprciated :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>ARVINDDDDDD!!,one more addition to my list of unique friends.Man!!! what a personality!!don't know what to say more as all has been discussed.but from my experience and all the interaction we had i just to have to say this _/\_..he helped me in my lop(SolidWorks :P),I always have fun whenever i talk to him.his simple nature is what i like the most about him.Storehouse of sheer awesomeness that he is ,don't be mistaken by his hulk like physique(:P),inside this gigantic body(:D) is a sweet innocent and highly intelligent guy who loves to chill out with a 2 litre bottle of coke and keep his room cleaner than a mnc's office.All the best for your future endeavours :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>_/\/\_ Arvind the PRO banda in campus ,always cheerful,supportive ,hepful.You are the most happiest person I have seen till now. In my first year you used to study a lot and used to be very serious. I thought you are very innocent and studious but slowly the scenario changed and you also became like me :P. We had great times together.
Please never loose the smile how ever harsh the situations might be which makes you a lively person and people gets attracted by that. Never forget me buddy. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krishna-deshmukh">KRISHNA DESHMUKH</a></p>
<p>The sheer number of testimonials that you can see on his page is a testimony of his popularity and admiration amongst the general public. Arvind is like a Santa Claus, albeit with a better sense of fashion( purple in a farewell suit is quite different.)But moving aside that, he is truly an amazing person to talk to, what with his witty takes on the campus environment, gossip and politics. Arvind is hard-working and devoted, and he has shown these qualities through his unparalleled work as both a member, and the Chief of one of the best and the most hard-working departments of the Campus, Arts and Deco. Humble, and helpful, he is always there lend you an ear or a hand, whenever you need someone to talk to. Arvind has been really inspiring, fun to have as a friend, and a great person. Best of luck for your future, and may you scale all the heights!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>

<p>I actually came to know him during the Pictionary episode only. Before that I knew that yes there's guy named Arvind up in that corridor. Though we used to keep crossing each-other here and there, but never had a chance to talk. He is a pro artist,Hard-working( arts and deco, so obviously), cheerful and seems to be very organized (judging by your room :) ). Very friendly, down-to-Earth and a caring attitude, he has it all. Surely pictionary and the panjim trip were awesome.
Hope you have an amazing time of your life :) All the Best.

<p>It's a wonder we became friends as we don't have much common among us. I remember in Chem-2 class he used to come with colored pens an pencils and used to take colorful notes. No doubt he is creative. He is sincere and prepares regularly for exams( exception being the 3rd year). We go to mess together ( if he has not ordered food from Shahi already which he does a lot of times). really gets under pressure during exam days but performs ultimately.there is no point in telling that he was the "best" chief Co. everyone knows that. 
In these 3 years he has made many friends and broke up with many of them.( this includes his neighbors I am not going to take the name otherwise this testimonial will go in the bin :P). There a very few remaining.But its nice to be one these few.
Some times behaves like a child..(lol but true). A good badminton player but never runs just stays at his place :P. 
Overall a nice person to share your thoughts with.He never makes fun of me (at least in front of me:P) though I make a lot of fun of him at the dinner table.
Very particular about his look( I didn't know this before but I came to know this at the time of Farewell and I believe everyone will agree with me), about cleanliness in his room, neatness of notes and about all things to which one can attach the word neatness and cleanliness.
He loves hygienic food.( Note: his definition of hygienic places includes Shahi in it:P).
He is going to be either a pro manager or a pro technical person.( maybe a pro painter too)
I wish you all the best arvind and please please please give me a job in your company. I promise to be sincere there. (the last :P in the testimonial)

<p>"Haaan Arvind Phodu!" Thats how i've addressed this guy for the last 3 yrs, for the mere reason that he is one. A phodu in acads, co-ordinator of a department in bits, a brilliant manager, multi-tasker and truly a very sincere person. Apart from that, he always has biscuits in his room (Santaclaus!!), though he can be a little cranky about it, Arvind does share food! All the best for the future!

<p>Rangaaa!!! Yaar iske bare mein ya likhu! Ekdum bachha hai! Iske saath agar deal kar liya toh duniya mein kisi ke bhi sath deal kar sakte ho. We have had so many arguments, so many fights (rooth jata hai yaar ye :P) and yet, he does an awesome job. He is someone who has completely changed the face of arts and deco in his tenure, extremely dedicated person, has very high morals and values, and sticks by them. A great guy at heart, he is best when he completely opens up, life bahot  constraints mein jeeta hai, par jab contraints hatakar ekdum khulkar rehta hai, tab best rehta hai. Jitni maturity se usne department mein changes laye, jitne calmness se pressures handle kiye senrs etc etc ke, and jitney efforts maare hain khud kaam ke liye, he has certainly made a breakthrough in the culture of arts and d, and a huge bow of respect to him for that! Banda 9 pointer tha, itna kaam kiya ki gpa 6 ho gayi, dinbhar waha structure ke paas khada rehkar tan ho gaya tha gandawala, par kuch nahi bola, yaar honestly, I was moved! Ur morals and hardwork will take you places! Be in touch! And thanks a lot for making Arts and Deco in waves the first of its kind, and the best ever! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>
