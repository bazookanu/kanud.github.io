<h1 class="page-title">Aseem Patil</h1><p>Aseem's name is synonymous with music in general, and guitar-playing in specific. He's immensely passionate, very hardworking and prodigiously talented when it comes to music. A master of everything from technical ability, improvisation and creativity to setting up sound equipment and recording, he commands a lot of respect from both within and outside the Music Society. He naturally has great taste in music which transcends genres, and is single handedly responsible for more than half the artists in my music library, including Blackstratblues, Zero, John Mayer, Porcupine Tree and Opeth.
As a member of the Music Society, we've played together on numerous occasions, from my first ever performance of a fusion piece for Quark 2010, to covering Blackstratblues (twice!), Opeth and Porcupine Tree. Without exaggeration, every single song that we've performed together has turned out brilliantly, for nothing is as reassuring as his presence on stage. Without a shadow of doubt, Aseem is the best guitarist and musician of our batch, and one of the best our campus has seen till date.
All this, aside from the fat that he has a 9-point-something CGPA.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
<p>Ok now the 6 foot tall studmaxx member of Shera Di Kaum.This guy and me have been sticking around in the music club and for the last 3 years and has played in atleast 90% of the songs in which i've played drums. If he had not been, I would never have listened to stuff like Blackstratblues, John Mayer, blues and jazz and might just have become one of those maniac soul-less drummers whose sole aim in life to play double bass at 250 bpm. After playing drums for around 5 years and seeing a lot of live music I can distinguish between guitarists who really like music and those who want to just show-off. Aseem fits in perfectly in the first category. He has a brilliant music sense and his playing never overpowers the singing, leaving those open spaces for everyone to fill in. Ok apart from all the music, this guy is an absolute fun lover and is seriously multi-talented. Plays good football, is a fucking 9 pointer, and can play every musical instrument that he can lay his hands on. And wooing ladies is child's play for him (U've got to teach me the tricks someday :P). Looking forward to making and playing seriously-epic music, getting drunk and more!

<p>Supercool.Smart.Sss-nerd. 
Aseem never really seemed like a 'senior' to me since the very initial days in college. I'd associate him with my very first memory of college, the Music Society inductions. Did my first 'Big Break' performance with him mentoring us (haha! :P) and am playing as his bandmate currently.
Aseem's easily one of the MOST talented people I've ever met. Can almost do anything. Play the guitar with unbelievable fluency, play some killer football and rape the shit out of his exams. If given a chance to compile a list of people who've influenced me the most in college, Aseem will easily make it to the top section. I probably associate myself only with music when it comes to learning something in college and I've learnt A LOT playing alongside him. He's a pool of knowledge when it comes to the technical aspects of music. This has made me very lazy, I always know I don't have to give much thought to anything else other than doing my parts properly because I always know he'll be there to handle the rest.
Its unbelievable how he can manage so many things, rather ace all of them and stay grounded at the same time. There's only one explanation to it, he does whatever he feels is right. As he himself puts "I've never sat idle for a single moment in my college life, I am always doing something" explains how much passion he has to learn and excel. 
Everyone knows what a brilliant guitar player he is.  We've played everything together. John Mayer's belief in a front of a crowd of 50 people and something like a jam packed alien venue like IITm cheering their lungs out for us. Extremely sincere, never takes things for granted. He was the first person I used to call up in my first year when I was confused about anything from choosing the 'right drink' (Yes, I was a pussy and thought I'd have liver failure if I something wrong) to planning a rough study schedule for an exam.
So all I'll say is, thankyou for everything man. We shall have some of the best time in the coming semester playing as many gigs as possible, partying as much as we can and discussing girls. I can't really imagine having as much fun playing music without you being around. Best of luck for everything, everyone knows you're to go places.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-kotwal">SIDDHARTH KOTWAL</a></p>
<p>Awseem. Hmmm lets see the freaky vein guy, the funky hair guy, the weird hand-thingy guy. Oh and how can I forget "viking trip!" (?) You're funny (and I won't mention laughing at you funny or laughing with you funny). And of course when you talk about him you can't leave the guitar out...so yeah I remembered some people promised you to come and smash you if you aren't taking it somewhere some 10 years down the line. And yes Banglore trip! That was fun! Good luck with everything, even the best need it you know!

<p>Patli! I met Aseem back in my first sem when we played futsal together and it was an absolute joy to play alongside this left footed genius. Our game was telepathic and i've never had more fun playing futsal! As i got to know him i found out he was multi talented. One of the most insane guitarist i've ever seen and a 9pt CG to match that. Patli truly came, saw and conquered everything in his BITS life. Its always fun talking to him and he's always either got some crazy song/music video to show you or some crazy game he's discovered for his phone. My new neighbor, its going to be one hell of a sem coming up! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Rohan Patil, i mean Aseem Pandey, oh sorry Aseem Patil. This guy has been one of my best friends on campus, and even though i got to know him a little late, its been one hell of a ride. Even though he has this strange aversion from management, he's really good at it. Music, grades, football,  he does it all in ishtyle. Its been amazing fun writing songs with him and playing music on stage together. There's always this sense of reassurance when he's up on stage with us, and it brings out the best in everybody. He's a crazy-talented musician and i've always respected his inputs, and better still he's always respected whatever ridiculous ideas i have. Apart from music, he's just this generally awesome-lanky-goofy-sometimes emotional kinda guy who has his blonde moments as well. He's also someone (apart from Vaas)  who almost always gives me a postive response for my weird-ass sense of humour. Of course, he's a big hit with the ladies, he knows that, but he's all modest about it :P And finally,  he's a great singer too. Haha, just kidding :P. Must wind up now and all i'll say is that next semester is going to something! Here's to a lot more gigs, trippy lights and great times ahead!  

PS: lets take the Pulsar next time around.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p> Patil is the one person on campus who I've got the utmost respect for. He's got everything, and he makes it look very simple. Aseem's one of the most genuine people anywhere. His guitar skills are everyone's envy, his smooth-talking  with the chicas natural, and his cognitive skills amazing. Ace footballer, champion at academics, and his love and knowledge of music exceeds anyone's on campus. Despite all this, he's got zero pride. He's probably one of the greatest people our campus has seen till now.  A typical mumbaikar, he's also very goofy-queasy at times, loves dressing up at occasions and his mannerisms are like an uncomfortable teenager :P . A constant companion at Bogmalo, I'll remember his tall frame at my door, going ' Hobbeys!' and proceeding to show me his freaky vein. I regret that he's not lived in our corridor, for his company is something I would have enjoyed immensely for 3 years. Best of luck in conquering the world alongside the groupies, you sentimental long-haired,  giant!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>I remember the first time I met Aseem was at the music club inductions – where he was auditioning for a guitarist and I was just there. I recall wishing I could take a leaf out of his book and learn to play the guitar as brilliantly as he could. 3 years later, I’ve ended up wishing I could take many more leaves out – be it the single-minded dedication with which he pursues what he loves, or the academic slaughtering, or the CGPA, or the easy flair with which he can woo women or the general multi-talented awesomeness. It’s almost ridiculous that all this is packaged into one lanky, at times goofy, Mumbaikar – who couldn’t speak his mother tongue to save his life. Shame on you. Moving on, Aseem is, without a doubt, the most passionate & insanely talented musician on campus – with an amazing technical knowledge about the field, brilliant improvisation skills, an eye for detail and, of course, top notch taste. Classic case of a genius misplaced in engineering college – although his grades make me wonder. He’s responsible for introducing me to so many new artists since first year – Zero, Blackstratblues, PT, Gary Clark Jr., Andy Timmons… it’s endless. I also can’t thank him enough for putting up with my tirade of idiocy at Bogmalo – part of the saviors at both times. Of course, like all ultra-cool people he’s had his fair share of blonde moments and keeps talking cryptically about his ‘secrets’ – of whom, god-knows-how-many people are guardians. I am, emphatically, not one of them and, hence, can happily poke fun of him for it. That has led me to christen it Patil’s Secret – an entity to be perceived with wonder. Saucier than Victoria’s Secret and more wound up than Ching’s Secret – only those who seek it with true purpose & good intention shall find the way. Screw the Holy Grail, knowledge of Patil’s Secret is the path to enlightenment. Coming back, Aseem’s got this really funny general paranoia about things and a very adolescent awkwardness in manners. But then, it’s always those who stay young at heart who go on to leave a dent on the world. Cheers, Patil! It’s been a privilege to know you and I hope we continue meeting up (when you’re not busy with your innumerable women, of course) and you give me free tickets to all your future performances. P.S. If that parent-swapping offer still stands, I think I’ll take it. P.P.S Stop showing me your stupid vein. I’ve got 4 ridges on my fingers, instead of the normal 3 – that owns your vein.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>

<p>Abey ye likhne ko bohot bore horela be.  Patil plays good guitar, is good sportsman, and gets good marks. Because of all these qualities he is my besht phrend. Ok, talking business, we're-a open a shack called Vodkyancha very soon. Setting shall be done, and it shall be done good. I know him since school days, where we both acknowledge each other's whack-headedness but we started chillin' (yes, I shall use that and no other word) more often in college. Bogmalo times have always been good, as well as dicking around with Fruity Loops, Audacity and God knows what other software. Patil's the reason I seriously got interested in sound, and I'm infinitely obliged. This is one guy who knows what he's doing, most of time. Very calm, and bizarro sense of humour, always handy when no one else is willing to laugh at your jokes. Among all the musicians I have met, Patil's ear and musicality stands apart. Here's to saying "I'm with the band" at a Paperkraft gig sometime.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
