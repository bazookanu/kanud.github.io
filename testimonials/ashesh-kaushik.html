<p>Ashesh - the noisy creeky high pitched shouting lazy and strangely mysterious neighbor.  He still is small boy and keeps cribbing about every single thing. Living opposite him my biggest job was to see to it that he does not sleep through the exam time. The nocturnal animal that he is, I dont remember him ever studying more than a day prior to the exam and he still manages to get respectable marks. He has immense knowledge about almost every field and he keeps on adding more. Him, punnet and shivansh are like the three stooges always making fun of each other(but mostly puneet) you will amazed by the number of plans these guys make of doing things together, but end up doing nothing. As the Research team head he managed to do a great lot under the circumstances. All in all a great person to be around(if you wear ear plugs) and great friend. Thanks for being AH4-250 and may you succeed in all your endeavors.
Cheers!!!

P.S - Dont have a lot of time, wanted to write a lot of more things but this is for now.

<p>Asheeeeeeeeesh. The co-creator of Papple. This guy is super crazy. He can sleep for hours and hours at a stretch. I have at times been worried because you didn't open that door (suspecting it to be a migraine attack :p) but he was just sleeping. This guy know so much of stuff about so many things, be it computers, aeroD, Softwares, and what not. Seldom have i found ashesh and shivansh talking about something but HAMARA FUTURE. Shivansh Puneet and Ashesh, the three "NOT SO DELHIItes" have taken a lot of trouble to make me feel like a south indian (I AM NOT). It was fun working with him as the Research Team Head, WAVES 2011, a job he did exceptionally well. for a major part of my BITS life AH4 250 has been my informal room. Thanks to Ashesh. :) I'm gonna miss this guy. Have a great life ahead. All the best for your future. And for the last time

<p>Ashesh is the the Fundoo guy, resourceful, king of procrastination, as subtle person in a loud world, and a loud person in a subtle world (of his own) - he is by far one of the few close people whom I call "Friends". Puneet, him & me spent nearly the whole of 3-1 at Ice'n'Spice, discussing the outcome of our lives, the pacts we shook on & the placement tensions I had (and still have!)

I came to know him in my 3-1, ironically enough as he was one of the first few people I met on campus. He is a true narcissist, an academician, person who knows what he wants to achieve in life.
It was his HP laptop on which I started my on-campus FIFA career (FIFA 07 it was I think).
 A true Red Evil - a trait that I hate & love at the same time.

Man, it has been a real honour to have known you. I wish you the best for your future & I hope you fulfill all your dreams in your life - because you deserve them!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
<p>That little kid who shouts at the top of his voice every time you talk to him ! Debate, shouting, showoff ( :P ) of knowledge he has is the common perception people have ! A very helping kid who loves to talk talk and surf on the net . His sleeping cycles are the most weirdest, one hardly knows when he is sleeping and when he is awake. Studies ! He studies a lot about everything other than acads, but he does sit up the whole nite before exams and goes through the portion and scores well, his grades speak for this fact. A fellow startup enthusiast which whom I share my ideas and plans, talking to him is fun, he never accepts your idea, the effort one makes in convincing the idea to him is appreciable. Damn smart and can point out mistakes very fast, so its always better to get documents and stuff checked from him before submitting. I remember those exams in 2-2 when I used to sit in his room trying to understand something related to CAS, I dint study but had loads of fun. The chudaaps we did, an awesome thing in my college life. His room is a meeting place for people be it related to assignments, chudaap, meetings or idea brainstorming . He is proud Delhi walla when he stays in Ghaziabad,UP or somewhere near Noida whatever but not in Delhi. And sadly he support a wrong team, those Red Evilmasters arent that good man, change over :P . He works, works a lot and sees to it that his work is on time and perfect. Waves was the best part to have fun and be at the receiving end of a monster. Be it finding ideas for Waves or making strategies for Habbu, it was fun and the best time we had in college.  I just love his room, its clean with awesome LED now and speakers ! I just envy his room . The CLEO Brandy Assignments and classes were awesome and moments to cherish. 
Hope we do something good for the nation and start many many startups ( ek se kaam nahi chalega ) . Good luck for your future, stop shout ! and dont stop loving that gentleman who made our life hell in Waves !

Eat on time sleep on time coz that is what kids dont do !

PS. Next sem we need to explore Goa more ! Let the party begin :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>

<p>This guy can shout. Out loud. and that too even when he is not shouting!
A hell-lot-of knowledgable person on a hell-lot-of topics, he has opinions on everything. Right ot wrong is a different matter (:P)
Smart, talented, quirky to the Y and a foolish child at heart, knows to get around things and get things done, albeit only at the end. 
We have had some great times together, and i think we'll have them in the future too. 
May you have an amazing time of your life and do whatever you want to do :)
It's been great knowing you. All the Best. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>Ashesh, lazy weird fellow who will always give you an almost unbelievable figure on his sleeping and eating patterns. Once you get to know him, he’s still lazy and weird, though now he’s slightly smart and knows his way around a keyboard (:D). One of the people who made my eco year tolerable and nicest, honest people I know. His point blank bluntness is refreshing. Keep in touch, do what you want to do, kick some butt.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijeet-mehrotra">Abhijeet Mehrotra</a></p>
