<h1 class="page-title">Ashin George</h1><p>I first noticed him during an extra lecture on basic electronics in earlier month of 1st semester. He drew some complicated circuit on board as a part of question asked by senior instantaneously of which I didnt understand anything. That was the time when I thought did I make mistake by taking EEE?. He is smart & very intelligent. His on the spot thinking power is unbeatable. He is cool guy & never worried about any exams. We had many lab sessions in common. It was fun to have talks with him during free time. I wish him all the best for his future.. Be in touch..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>There are some people in the world who are born geniuses. This guy is one of them. How little he studies and how large he scores is still an unsolved mystery for most of us. He has raped every subject that has ever come across him, showing little mercy to the low GPA junta like us. Apart from acads, he excels in quizzes for which he has won a ton of prizes (though he never treats after winning them :P ) and is good at playing badminton and football.
He is an ardent fan of mess food and always takes the pain to come up a floor and call us to go there. And his skill of running more than a dozen different programs at the same time on his primeval and dying laptop is one worth me mentioning. I've had plenty of good experiences with him right from the waves control team in the first year, the many quizzes along the way, playing football and badminton and so on. The conversations we have had about random things have given me a great deal of knowledge. Most of all he has been a really good friend for the past three years and hopefully for many more to come. All the best for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>The Pro. A god when it comes it comes it quizzes and acads. Hes been acing them both ever since he since he stepped foot on campus. Ask him anything from the capital of Uganda to the number of steps in the hostel stairway he knows it all (no joke,we checked :| ).He is that guy who bunks most of his classes and doesn't open his book right until the day before the exams and still manages to top it. Other than all that hes one of the most patient guys i have seen.He has spent hours clearing my stupid doubts.I have never seen him get angry in these past three years,not even once, in fact no one has ever seen him losing his temper. My fellow badminton buddy :D. He is one of the main members  of the quiz club.A real pro when it comes to electronics n stuff and also the one on the front lines when it comes to making fun of Kollam :D. Jokes aside a really gr8 guy, a bit stingy...wait no..really stingy             ( :P). Hes been a great friend all these years and soon to be my corridor mate for 4-1.yoyo :D  .I wish only the best for him in the future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>Ashin is nothing but a genius within that slender frame of his...A brilliant mind...he is good at almost everything. Nothing seems to be impossible for him... I am awestruck by his  cool and calm attitude with which he solves complex problems, and always gets it right. As a person too..he is very nice...you rarely get to see him smile...but in such rare occasions...when he does smile....you can feel that warmth around...he is a good, sincere friend...always ready to help. The only thing we have in common...is actually what i like about him the most (:P)... his ability to speak sooooooo fast...just like me!!!:D :D iT WAS NICE TO KNOW YOU.... You are one guy..who is definitely going to make it big in life. All thebest!!!

<p>Ashin is probably the most brilliant friend i ever had. He can sit and study for an hour before an exam and still end up topping a EEE cdc. I remember once we decided to study trw slides together and he would finish memorizing the whole page even before I finished reading. His memory is unbelievable. Also one the quiz masters of the campus. Another quality about Ashin is that he never ever gets angry. Even after three years together, I have never seen Ashin get angry. Its been great to have him as a friend. Really sad that we won’t be spending one more sem together. Its been fun man. So many amazing memories. Going to mess together when the mime club’s practicing, the outings, the amazing treats you gave :P, the trekking, jokes about your violence and aggressiveness XD, Chennai, time spent in sikhil’s room, doodhsagar etc. etc. Will miss you a lot. And when become an IAS officer or CEO of some company give me job somewhere where people exist:P Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
