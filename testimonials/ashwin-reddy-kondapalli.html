<p>The person i wanted to be like in one sentence. Coming to details ...i don’t  know who is ashwin until the end of first semester. i still regret that i didn’t  meet u in first semester  . ..but after that there were  almost  no  occasions we had been apart.  Very patient  and  cool . talks very less and listens very much .We call him as “scanner “.  he can scan any number of slides (example all management courses and electives just “A”) even he scans menu card in the restaurant  and also  girls in the mess  within an eye blink  . he is very determined   2-2 semester is a perfect example for that . very talented  he knows almost all kind of stuff  around the world . very passionate to learn new things that is the thing which made him very unique .fun loving guy even though he doesn’t have any sense of humour (except when he was drunk :P )  , one more thing i recently came to know is  that he has so much girls following for his innocent smile (indeed  it’s not an innocent  :P ) .very charming and has great  taste of dressing. He has good leadership qualities every trip  since 2nd semester is planned by him (and also me :P )and organised by him  ..each one is better than before .
I never carried a wallet in my entire bits life because i gave all my atm card  to him. he used to spend  for me from that because there was no small outing without we  2 apart  (thanx for taking my financial assistant post :P ). He listens to all types of music he watches all types of movies he reads all types of books  (he puts his finger in all the stuff :P )
My favourite  time with u is dinner in C mess  i really love those dinner timings keep on talking about girls and we used to comment on them and also cooking in ur room , night outs (u know which night out’s  :P) , walking around the campus eating at each possible place , shopping we did , bike rides ,train journey  and so on u were there with me from last 3 years all the time thank u for giving all those unforgettable memories .i  really learned from u how to stay calm when situations are out of  control .
If i come back to campus and recollect my memories ..u were there with me all the time evrywhere
I’m really proud that ur my friend. As i always says (mainly in bogmalo :P ) first thing thing  i’m going to miss after BITS is YOU and there is no doubt about that .  i hope u will achieve great heights in life  :)

<p>I will start this with a 'smile' because that's the thing i get in my mind first when i think about Ashwin....He is a cool guy with lots and lots of patience and I don't remember a second seeing him angry or sad(i have seen him in a bit dull mood actually but he comes out of it and laughs immediately..).His room is common room for our friends group and we use spend hours in his room discussing some non-sense during our first year. He got his laptop in his second semester and I use to play games in his laptop and I used laptop more than him at some point actually..He is really intelligent and decent hard-worker(I had seen his max. during 2-2 when he ended up getting 9+).He has a special ability of scanning all the slides and pages in books and it works only for humanities courses and electives and end up with getting A. He doesn't put pen at any point of time during his preparation even if its a maths course.unluckily he is from Msc.Maths but he still manages to get good grades just by seeing the problems and not by doing them....He has interest in knowing all the things in the world except his acads...One more thing I would mention is his database on girls of our college..Oh man how can he say the details of a girl when he sees her at any distance & at any angle..Only he must know it....I hope you can control your weaknesses(You got it na!!!) and you will achieve great things but I want to see you to achieve even more .....I will definitely miss you and your room ...Next sem will be last sem for me to have that facility..Hope you will have a great life ahead...  :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
