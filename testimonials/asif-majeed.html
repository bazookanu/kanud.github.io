<p>Asif Sirji :) Aap to kamal ho, aapki batein bemisaal hain...I have truly and sincerely enjoyed your presence in each and every lab we have had together. Only few people can handle my crazy behavior and you sir get an A+ for that. His looney thirst to get to know the entire working of everything is simply fascinating and I really admire his simpleton nature. Those mad lab hours with Shiva-the Dood and the ic chats after that are gonna be etched in my memory forever :) Thank you once again for being an integral part of my BITS memories, no doubt you'll have a great future whatever you decide to do.Keep smiling you pro-photographer :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>This multi-talented person one of my few best friends on campus.
He is Photography Stud, Pr0-HAcker, Mech-Guru, Sports-Junkie,TV series Maniac and so on. This selfless fellow I came to know recently is a Coffee Saint. If there is a coffee -Apocalypse. He will have enough coffee to give out to an entire floor of an hostel which he actually makes and gives.
Asif and me keep talking random Sci-Fi and close to-reality science. I always look forward to our " Fringe" Talks. 
This guy has always helped me when I was in need. 
A humble being , a good friend and a all-rounder.
Best of luck macha for the future. Hope we can do Rad project together. :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/edwin-abraham">Edwin Abraham</a></p>
<p>Sifi! a sweethrt who loves his room more than nything. Is there somthing he is not good at? from being an epic photographr to random ubuntu/linux (wat so evr) geek, to god knws wat all tv series does he watch simultaneously to my RC car mate to a great basketball player to the epic Ultimate champ to so many things. Yash for a change could not have been more right " Fuck those dhongi baba's and teach people the real 'Art of Living' :)" . This guy knows how to live the life to the fullest and hardly cares what ppl think about him. One of the dearest frnd i have on campus who can be anything but harami, most selfless guy.

<p>One just cannot describe Asif Majeed without being in his ever lasting presence. Will try to sum up. Amazingly sharp mind(one of the bests i have ever seen). Ingenious attitude towards learning. Always finds joy in whatever he is does. Whatever he does, does it in style and with perfection. A true friend, whom you can rely on, tell your tales and wait for that most beautiful face on earth to show that radiant smile and say "Li8 macha.. Everyhting is going to be okay".. (don't flatter yourself bitch, i am not talking about the countenance, i am talking about that look on your face, that bloody beautiful look on your face, that look which can pierce through all space time and reach your heart, that beautiful look of happyness, that look of genuineness, that look of c'mon life!! Bring it on!!) To some random guy who would be reading this, he might think, random testimonial with adjectives picked from thesaurus, well then you are so mistaken. This guy is all that god meant us to be like.Pure Happyness. Pure competence. Pure love. My dear Franciso d'Anconia, I love you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
