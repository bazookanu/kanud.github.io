<h1 class="page-title">ASIM ALI</h1><p>Very impractical at times.hardly gets worked up over situations..fun to be with. He proves that living with him, there never is a dull moment!!! The speed and voice(or noise) with which he speaks is unbearable (Specially when you dont understand what is being said) .But thats d fact I love most about him. He just doesnt care what other people think. Has his own sense of style. Yo Ali! cheers patrrrol prrummpp! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikunj-sharma">Nikunj Sharma</a></p>
<p>Often first impressions are misleading. Its definitely true for Ali. He behaves like a 6 year kid, making stupid Pjs, picking up silly fights and talking nonstop crap (or what sounds like crap in his unique voice). His personality couldnt be more contrast. An intensely mature person and every-ready to help, he is an extremely well-informed and intellectual guy, I have had the most intellectually stimulating discussions late night with him. I still remember one fine night we were debating from 3 in the night to 10 in the morning with topics varying from economics, politics, religion, sex, cricket, football etc. Perhaps the best sportsperson on campus, his skill in playing football and table-tennis are unparalleled.
Ali, stay the same. Always! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>"And here we present, Asim Ali." "Hello." <applause> He's not your stereotypical society-basher, incessant talker socialite. Very reserved and calm, he has these brilliant insanity traits that I completely adore. Be it the sudden breaking into a dance while walking down the corridor or cracking the most unexpected of jokes at any time or being manhandled by Mandar. His football game is a treat to watch, unlike a few other members of our football team. We also have a shared interest in camp humour and quizzing. It is not a well known fact but Ali is also a very good writer and he knows just about EVERYTHING that is going on in the world right now, right from the situation in any of the Arab revolts to speculations in the Premier Leagure transfer window. All in all, Ali exudes a peculiar aura of cool.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Asim Ali , No. 6 , Center Midfielder, Hes one of the most gifted footballers i have seen or played with. May it be on the field or off it ,Ali's antics are well known. At first glance, hes this shy introvert who rarely utters a word, but as Ali enters his prime hes one of the most entertaining and lively people to be with, may it be his unique sense of humor , references to 'Damini', his imitation of Mrinal or Shray ,his love and respect for Mandar or how hes ever ready to take anyone's case (often backfiring on him). Ali is a brilliant sportsman, unbeatable in table tennis, also an excellent cricketer and footballer, he also holds the accolade of being captain for BITS football team's biggest victory (6 -2). We've shared great times together, may it be the movie nights, goa league , manipal tournament or just random visits to his room discussing Indo-Pak politics at 1 am in  the night ,or just taking sapra/dusty/pranky's case.  Its been a wonderful experience, and i wish you all the best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>L as I like to call him is one of the nicest guys I have met on campus. In spite of my constant torture and mockery of his football skills he is always quick to reply with a smile and "nison"( Dunno what that means). A very good holding midfielder on the lines of Mascherano( In terms of their goalscoring capacity) but a complete ass when it comes to FIFA. I still remember his proness when out of the blue he scored some 100+ in Physics compre and was on the verge of getting an A. What a sad day it would have been for the rest of students like us. Luckily he is back to his li8est best again. Best of luck for your future man and keep in touch.

<p>Aliii! Ali, before i say anything else, is one the most gifted CMs i have ever played with. Incredible eye for a pass and exquisite delivery epitomizes his midfield play! Ali is a pure entertainer. He has the amazing ability to transform any mundane situation into an incident that will talked about for years to come! For people who meet Ali for the first time, he may come off as shy and introvert-ish, but once you get to know the guy, its a whole new ball game. This avid maker of home videos is an absolute charmer. He's witty, smart and can have you in splits with some of the jokes he cracks! I've had some really good times with and without the football team and I hope this is the start of a long friendship! Take care Ali!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Ali!! What a player! We were the first ones to start out playing football for the team and this guy truly came into his own during SPREE 2011.My man of the tournament without a doubt and his exploits in Manipal have become part of folklore. But let me tell you something that people might not be aware of-- Ali is a true fighter, I remember when he didn't make it to the SPREE squad in 2010, it would've been hugely discouraging for anyone, but credit to his character he didn't give up and in a year he was the most important player in the team. I am not trying to flatter you Ali, but the truth is that you are the MOST fierce competitor I have ever come across, one who relishes challenges and more often than not comes out on top. Not to say that Ali didn't cause a few problems before this SPREE, but then again he bounced back like I knew he would.He says he is not a team-man but believe me he is.I can't describe how playing with Ali has been like.This was football but there are things in life more important than that and one of them is friendship. Ali has been a very very good friend, one of the few people that you can completely trust with anything. He might be absent-minded ( we all know that!) but he has a good heart. We've had some amazing memories and I'm sure that's going to continue Ali is also extremely witty (yes he is and he is also the leader of l**d fraternity which has lot of great names) and really fun to hang out with. Also, he is very well-informed about a lot of things, ranging from sports to politics. A fellow SRK fan, his Aamir Khan imitation is also brilliant!! You're truly a great friend Ali. And another thing, I was the first guy who started calling you by your last name in campus, just that you know!! Cheers to our friendship No.6!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayush-sinha">Ayush Sinha</a></p>

Ali is one person I am glad I could play with. I did spend half the time crying for him to give me the ball but the other half was amazing :P Both of us made an unbeatable centre midfield. We have never lost a tournament where we played in the centre together. The 2 slams and the BPL we won were so much fun. He’s undoubtedly the best CDM I have seen. To get past this guy you need to think twice. So clever on the pitch but dumb and absent minded off it:P Only wish I could play many more games with him. A fellow barca fan, we spend hours discussing their game and tactics. The past 3 years he’s been a great friend to me. I ‘m extremely thankful to  him for those training sessions he dragged himself to, just because we told him to. Also gave me company on our bogmalo trips where we would sit in a corner and act cool drinking coke :P Really really gonna miss you man. I know you’re a busy man XD but please please keep in touch!

<p>OK!Ali,let me ask you one thing-who the hell calls you azzuri?and rotta?seriously?Moving on,Asim(when was the last time anyone called him that?) came across as a really shy guy during our football games in cp in first year. but gradually i realised how wrong i had been. he is one of the most awesome and unique person i have ever met. From the football and futsal matches we have played together to doing random shit in the hostel(like laughing behind people's backs) to the evenings at bogmalo (bogmalo talks,remember? :P)-its been a hilarious 3 years with him. Ali's antics are just unbelievable-"bhakharwadi che",calling for the ball in football, the "(r)onaldinho" thing and many more. Yes, he is absent minded, but that doesnt take away anything from his awesomeness. He is a real genius when it comes to football and i reckon the football ground is the only place where he actually makes an effort to use his brain. He has been such a great friend to me that I cant even imagine hostel life without him. I am really gonna miss this fool a lot. Best of luck, Ali!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-prakash">Pranav Prakash</a></p>
<p>Ali might come across as someone who is really shy at first but when he opens up with you  can see a whole new side of him and I don't think I would be going overboard by saying that he is by far one of the finest conversationalists I know(though it might be difficult to make out what he is saying, most of the times). His knowledge is so diverse and comprehensive that you can speak with him on any topic ranging from football to politics to religion to  ancient civilizations. ANYTHING at all. He is a brilliant writer as well. Having him as a next door neighbour can be irritating at times because of the large number of guests that visit him due to his warm and friendly nature, especially "The LOUD ONE" from AH5 ground floor. The awesome coffee-making skills that he has acquired haven’t helped the situation at all. He is very very naïve and gullible. He takes being absent minded to a whole new level. Naveen's "Ali, you jackass" or the laundry episode are things that we will stay etched in my memory throughout. What I also won't be able to erase is the epic trip we took to Mumbai for the World Cup Finals, the post-match celebrations and then dozing off at the Marine Drive Promenade. His quick-wit and spontaneity are things that deserve a special mention. His ability to transform any situation to a laughter riot is amazing. Varad's birthday celebrations are testimony to that.. Brilliant at imitating people, his imitation of Shahrukh and Aamir and of some people in the football team have become a stuff of legend now. The most natural sportsman I have ever seen.  Ballads of his football prowess have already been sung on this page, but very few people know of his skill in Table Tennis.  He has immense amount of intelligence but is equally lazy which has let him down a number of times. A very religious fellow, he reads Namaz five times a day and there hasn’t been a single instance I have known of him missing this routine of his.
Always stay the same Ali and I hope you get that Al-Jazeera job. All the best.
This is the time when you say “Naisan yaar Sapre”

Asim Ali was the first guy with whom I interacted on the campus. A guy from your State, closely associated with your home town, I was like what else to ask for?  He seemed to be ‘responsible’, sincere, polite and a knowledgeable person. But alas! He proved me wrong on the very second day by skipping his lunch or rather forgetting it. He is intelligent but too lazy to put in efforts. A talismanic midfielder, a great cricketer and an equally good TT player or should I say he is ‘The Sportsperson’ of our batch. He is hardly known by many in the campus, but those who know him will certainly agree that he is one the most entertaining persons on the campus, be it the training session (the ALI exercise)or his verbal fights with Sapra, noija, bapu,sinha,ahuja,tiwari or me. I want you to know that your ‘Nachi’,’tendulkar’ &‘moustache’ acts will be remembered forever. Wish u luck!!
