<h1 class="page-title">Aswin Gigi</h1><p> Our own Chandler Bing....He is one of the funniest guy(not by looks :P) i have ever seen.His hilarious and goofy dialogues in thrissur slang are unbeatable.But most of the dialogues are about himself.The confidence with which he insults himself is just AMAZING !! Still he manages to earn our 'respect'. Whenever he is linked with sum girl,he always blushes.His chubby cheeks adds to his cuteness.:D He was always ready to help me out (for which i wud i love to do sumthin bak) without any 2nd thought. Ex-DOCW member and Author of one of our course textbook!! .Hardworkin,egoless,cheerful....... the list is endless. Keep rocking.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-">Rahul </a></p>

Super funny, extremely friendly, this guy can send you into splits thanks to his love for cracking jokes on himself!! I really admire this character  of his...the ability to joke about himself, it just proves how humble and down to earth he is!!! I will always remember how I wacked your face, defeated you in arm-wrestling...and yeah..wacked your face again!! Your cheeks are simply awesome!!!They are sooooo huge and chubby..that literally thats the only thing I see on your face,...well not really...infact...I consider you to be one of the handsome guys on campus....GIGI!!! I know you have already started blushing!!! 
So...coming to the point, this guy is very genuine, warm, friendly and soo helpful...you can always rely on him...and he will take care of you..like a big brother...his simplicity and humbleness (even though he is a supposed millionaire) will take him a long way in life...so Gigi...Da all the best!!

Its simply awesome!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/fatima-dilruba">Fatima Dilruba</a></p>
<p>Gigi or gigy piggy as he was called by one significant girl in our PS, is one heck of  a person. Cracking jokes is second nature to him, jokes at anyone - himself, friends, mostly at me whenever I am in the vicinity. This attribute of his has significantly created ill feelings between us which peaked during those two summer months in Trichy. But Gigi has mellowed down in our 3rd year and I no longer feel like killing him as much as earlier :) . Otherwise Gigi is very helpful and will never let you down when you are in need. He is very  sensitive about his cheeks and has had countless jokes cracked about them. Wish u good luck for the future , no that you will need it !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nithin-s-poduval">Nithin S Poduval</a></p>

<p>Coming from the cattle feed factories of Thrissur in Kerala, this lanky guy is one of the most lively characters in our group. This japanese-anime lover has a cunning ability to deliver comebacks and many of his comments on people and happenings are brilliantly clever and witty. He shares a love for PJ's like me and doesn't hesitate to let it out every time even though some flop badly. And his incessant self-mockery never gives you a chance to tease him about anything. Also this guy prides himself on being a mechie as you can very well know through his constant jibes on mech subjects, mech profs and the lack of placements and salary. Having said all this, this balloon-cheeked dog is actually a really good guy at heart and a helpful friend who has no inhibitions what so ever for the way he is and will help us with whatever financial needs we have when he takes over his family business sometime in the future (:P). A lot of good memories together with him, the drinking parties at bogmalo, road trips, the epic dudhsagar trip, and many more. All the best for a great future!, in some hellishly hot thermal power plant in a remote district in Jharkhand, along with me of course :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>GIGI , JIJI, or GHIGHI :D . My neighbour, my aaoc group study partner, my mos partner (:P), podhu joke team partner, GIGI has been a very significant part in my life in the past 3 years. The first time i saw him, he was this decent nerdy guy who wore only shirt and formal pants...but that was only for the first few days when his parents were here, after they left, gigi became a total BRO to me, fun-loving, charismatic, chubby, joke-cracking guy. He is so chubby that hes got cheeks all over his face, and he is always open towards jokes on his cheeks that he sometimes even makes fun of himself.. :D and THAT cannot be found in many a person. GIGI is unique, rare and really hard to find (more samples maybe found around irinjalakkuda…please refer for details :P).  He tries to help in any way he can, and he never lets you down.  Hes got an addiction to headphones and mp3 players, that when u usually want him to listen to u, u need to pull them out from his freakin ears first!! :P. He is a millionare, but never looks so...it’s not an insult but a complement at his normal way of life. He is humble and down to earth. I seriously do not know what i would have done without him in my corridor. He always comes to NC with me whenever i call him, even if he is busy. Nightouts are his speciality. He works hard on all his projects and endeavours... he has even co-authored one of the mech course textbooks (FUCK YEAHHH :P). Gigi has a really great sense of humor, in spite of some dents here and there (:D yeah bitch). He has been a wonderful friend to me all the three years, for which i am grateful to God. U are too good man. Please do not change.. Wishing you all success and happiness for all the years to come....

<p>Gigi my neigbour!! He is so lazy that he has spent months without registering a complaint to get his fan fixed. His room is probably the dirtiest on campus :P. One of the most unintentionally hilarious guys i have met in my life, he is one of the few good friends i have made in bits. Friendly, helping and down-to-earth, he does whatever he can to help you (which usually isnt enuf :P). Stay the way you are, dont change whatever any1 says. Wish u all the best for ur future gigi, not that u need any of my wishes with all ur riches back in thrissur :P. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-chandramouli">Varun Chandramouli</a></p>
<p>Gigi or Gigo is one gem of a person. We did our PS-1 together and I am disheartened that our PS2 is not together :( I had an amazing experience during those 2 months in summer and his attitude and hilarious nature sets him apart from the rest. The random Podu bashing and seeing his Joga Bonito video time and time again and laughing incessantly, the Pondi trip and all the restaurants we tried in Trichy,  man we had a lot of fun. Extremely down to earth ( considering he is a multi-millionaire :P) and helpful , he accomplishes any task once he sets his mind to it ( though u had a weird project partner :P ). I hope you dont forget this noob friend of yours :P. All the best for your future man and I wish you all the success and happiness in life. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
