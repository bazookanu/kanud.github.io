<h1 class="page-title">Aswin V Chandran</h1><p>Most of the people on campus now him either as Logan or Avada.I have my doubts if he still remembers his actual name. A pro in AOE and CS. He started his aoe playing days with me (i have actually managed to beat him once long back if i remember :D ) but  went miles ahead of me from that point.The amount of time and dedication he puts into perfecting his craft is commendable :P . All the CS games he hosts starts filling from the last slots:P.This guy has been following the american standard time ever since he came here.All jokes aside-hes really brilliant,i still remember for some of the exams he opened his book for the first time right outside the exam hall just 5mins before the test,and still managed to score decent marks. He can really excel at anything if he puts his mind to it. A totally li8 guy, a bit too li8 sometimes. And also a great actor.Hes in the mime club and was the brains behind the 3G scene. One of my best friends on campus.Helpful,a bit annoying:-|, friendly and always the life of the party. Hope to have an awsum 4-1 with u in CH1(hoping to learn a bit of CS frm u next sem:D). Wish u all the best for your future and always keep in touch. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>PK a.k.a avada/logan is the undoubtedly the best gamer in our batch. This guy hosts servers minutes before an exam and that’s his commitment to gaming. When the whole campus goes to sleeps PK starts his usual day. All the AOE juniors adore him and are always looking to learn from him. A big shahi and Emma Watson fan :P An amazing actor and influential member of the mime club. I will never forget his 3G scene and neither will anyone else who saw it. He makes chali’s which take a few minutes for people to understand and another couple of minutes to recover from. We spent unforgettable times together. Gonna miss you da. Don’t forget to keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>PK..friednly n jovial..thats what i know of aswin v chandran:P i had doubts abt his name at first whether it was aswin pk or aswin vipin or aswin chandran :D well, rarely do u get to see him.one of the best gamers in campus i have heard..n a shahi fan:P so the less chances of meeting him outside are justified;) but when u get to meet him,talks a lot with his jolly malabar accent:) a good mimer..an all together fun person.All the best for ur future:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shalima-sreenath">Shalima Sreenath</a></p>
