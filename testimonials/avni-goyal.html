<h1 class="page-title">Avni Goyal</h1><p>You can be pain in the ass, can irritate the hell out of anyone. But you are one of the most daring person i know. We have had some great times and some not so great times. But all along you have been one of the best person to make fun of and the best person to have fun with. It's almost impossible to imagine 321 empty.  Avni Goyal believe it or not I'm soooooooooo gonna miss you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>I'll write one more. Super senti over you today.
Avni Goyal if i have to define you is a super senti, mommy of this world , super seedhi and super fun. It's sometimes impossible to believe that how can be a person be so cute and so cutely stupid at times. I will miss knocking on her door randomly and asking 'abey kuch khaane ko hai kya?' or just teasing her on every possible thing. I'll miss our girls night out with her, outing with her, the famous 'beer/coke game', gossip sessions.
Shit man! Dont go :(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>You are one very sweet person who always looks out for friends.. Also I must say that you are one person who doesn't care what world thinks of you... you just do what you like/want to do.. A very impressive thing about you is your dedication towards the dance club but with that comes some lil flaws here and there ;)... and pls don't scold me for writing this :P
But jokes apart, you are a person who one can look upto when they are in need of a friend.. Thank you avni for being there :-* .. Be this way always or may be not :P :P ... I hope this is not bye bye for us and we will see more of each other in the future (if you know what i mean :P)... hehe... It's sooo much fun with you... Thanx for all the awesomeeeee memories in dance club, in hostel, in chemistry I classes, during exams and assignments.. Thanx for all those words of care and comforting hugs wen i am down... You leave imprints behind wherever u go n dat makes it difficult for ppl to forget you.. the case is same here.. I ll always remember you as a great friend :D ... Have a great life ahead!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/garima-agarwal">Garima Agarwal</a></p>
<p>You are the one person i've seen change the most in these 3 years!! what you were in 1st sem and what you've become now :D you've toh left all of us behind! but i love you like this :) You're one of the most loving people i've met, and you'll go out of your way to help your friends. That smile of yours can light up anyone's day, so keep smiling always! You've always been there for me, good times and bad. All the nights we tried studying DECO n watched more movies than any studying! All the gossips with Pinku, Gari, you and me, the times when you slept in my room cause you were scared to sleep alone :P All the times together in the club, staying out till 230, Bitsian practice, We've spent great times together, inside and outside the club, and I'm gonna miss you so much. And i have to add, just like everyone else in the club even i'm scared of you :D Love you Avni, Keep smiling always, and spreading your happiness. You're very special to me :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Avni remember the time in 12th when you treated all of us at Mc D just because we asked you for a treat, for no reason at all? You are still the same cute and adorably stupid girl who cares so much about all her friends, I really mean it, you are one of the most caring people around. Anything girly you need and it'll be found in Avni's room :D Always smiling, ready to help at any time of the day, and the super sweet drama queen. You are a wonderful person Avni and I'm so glad we met in Vidyarthi and ended up here together as neighbors here in BITS. I'm going to miss you a lot! Love you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>

<p>Third-year-Avni, for whom I am writing this testimonial, is completely different from the girl I met in first year and feared throughout the duration of Black Comedy practices. Thank god we re-met, or we would have lost out on a really great friendship! The really amazing thing about you is the way that you do everything so whole-heartedly. Whether it's being super-supportive of your friends, or going for dance practice, or running dance errands or somehow or the other making sense of LR(1) parsing, you do everything with passion, and it's really inspiring. Studying with you has been so much fun, not only because you turned out to be a really cool person to hang out with, but also because it's so refreshing to work with someone who really appreciates all the things we are learning! You are so talented in Dance and Drama, and maybe even Wedding Planning, so I will wish you general luck for whatever you end up doing... I'm sure you'll do great! I'll miss our excellent study sessions and I'll definitely miss you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>

<p>Avni...you are the first person (and the only one till now) who shared my love for Kathak.It's been really fun spending time with you.I know I am not of those people who talk too much...but with you can make a person feel so comfortable.Your smile...I m a fan of it. You live your life 100% and do whatever you really want to do..and when you do something you do it with all your heart.That's one thing I've learnt from you.Whatever time I've spent with you has been  memorable.I wish I would have spent some more time with you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/meghna-mehta">Meghna Mehta</a></p>
