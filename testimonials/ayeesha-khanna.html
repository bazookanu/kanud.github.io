I hope you are able to laugh throughout your life. Best of luck.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/udit-dewan">Udit Dewan</a></p>
<p>Ayeesha! Met her during our workshop sessions in our first year,and she was just another hottie from our batch then.Small talk.But its been long since then.There was MT2,the labs,reports and what not! Then through all these shitty chemistry courses,I saw an animated and cheerful person,who was really passionate about what she liked.Something I really admire in her =) Those darn CE labs were great fun with her jokes(even if they were on me =D) and her antics were something that I enjoyed,however "mean" I came across as =P Man,those times still make me laugh..Graceful,smart(or should I add shrewd? =D),resourceful ;-) and hardworking,be it notes or reports,she sure knows how its done.This is in no way goodbye,but just a very brief account of some cool times we shared in these 3 short years..She is gonna go much higher and farther than most of us,and I wish her the very best on that stellar journey that she has waiting for her.You go girl!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
<p>Ayeesha... Most people when they look at her are awe-struck by her beauty... She is like one of those hindi soaps lead who even in the middle of the night or at 5 in the morning could look perfect! But i won't go on to talk about her beauty and poise cause who in  the campus doesnt know about that.... what ill talk about is the totally awesome being that she is...which i did not know for a long long time.. Ayeesha is always super happy, super excited about the minutest of things... ( like phenolphthalein turning pink.. "Oh this colour its so pretty" :P.....), she has her own extra- ordinary way of doing things, systematically, without any stress... and despite all the cribbing is always able to find a way around them... She is extremely passionate towards her interests and what she is'nt interested in... she doesnt do it just for the sake of doing it..she aims for perfection... Ayeesha can blend in with all kinds of people and her marketing career looks very bright... I will never forget the shitty Chemistry labs we suffered through together... singing and dancing while washing beakers... her great pipeting skills... and the never ending "If this was a job, i swear I'd quit" .... Those labs would have been 10 times more pathetic (Huh! like thats possible... ) without you and hopefully together we will survive chemical engineering :) ... Ayeesha you are a beautiful person both inside and out...may you get the very best in life... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>

<p>Ayeesha Khanna aka Mirchi, Maal, AK-47 etc is one bomb. :D  Starting out with utter disdain for each other in our first year to becoming the single phrase Shivi-Ayeesha, we were a typical story book college friendship waiting to happen. The birthdays that we've celebrated together have been my best and most eventful so far. I think with all the cribbing sessions we've had, bogmalo trips and all-nighters pulled off, secrets shared, dresses tried on and rejected, songs recorded and pretty much everything else that I've done in college, Ayeesha's become something of a habit for me! 
Despite the mood swings and bitchiness (!), we've found more in common than imaginable. She's a mix of talent, creativity and crazy. But there are some things, like the occasional flash of PINK or the whatsit-berry flavoured shampoo, or the repulsion from any kind of climbing/trekking, that make you wanna look at her incredulously but are acceptable only from her. She's got quite the hoity toity star quality about her and with good reason. :) 
Between our artsy future plans and swanky Manhattan office daydreams, we've got a long way to go together. Its been amazing so far and I have a feeling things are only going to get better. Cheerio! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivi-anand">Shivi Anand</a></p>

<p>When I walk out of BITS, I will have fond memories and lifelong friends to cherish, but I will also have regrets- one of them being the inability to reach out and light the candle of friendship with Ayeesha.
I am in no position to judge her; I will say that when it comes to performances, she is a paragon of artistic virtues, when it comes to friendship she is a diamond in the rough and when it comes to hunger for success, nothing can whet her appetite.
Time alters people and perceptions; probably her dressing style is unchanged, probably she appears the same, probably she may have grown a few spots, yet when I think of her, I am reminded of 'exotic'. Whether it is her scintillating skin (basking in Sun’s glory), photogenic face or fluffy hair, she is indeed a writer’s muse and ironically an accomplished novelist herself!
And then comes her ebullient laughter, her inherent sultriness and her fantastic command over English. Blessed would be the person, who enjoys the felicity of Ayeesha’s company. 
For some individuals, sky is the limit. Maybe she is one of them. However, I am confident that she will stay grounded despite reaching the zenith. 
When all is said and done I do not hope to walk with her hand in hand, however I do hope to meet her once, but well, that is in my hands and I wish when the occasion comes they are not tied like my tongue.

<p>I can't write you a testimonial, I just can't. I can not put words together to describe how awesome it is to have you around, how important a friend you are, how you've become an integral part of that little voice in my head that says what's right and what isn't, how you've stuck through all my little and large ups and downs, how you make everyone's day better by hanging around and flashing that .... umm .. smile :P , and generally how the last three years spent in your company has been an absolute blast. Here's to a lifetime of friendship, cause well, I really can't let a friend like you go...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aseem-patil">Aseem Patil</a></p>
