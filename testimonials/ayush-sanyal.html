title: Ayush Sanyal

<h1 class="page-title">Ayush Sanyal</h1><p>Probably one of the softest-spoken guys I have ever met on campus, Ayush remains in my books as a gracious man with loads of patience. Extremely down-to-earth in nature and very practical in his thoughts, opinions and approach towards life, he possesses this ability of just walking into an unknown crowd and be one with it within no time. The growth of our friendship in a short span of time and limited interactions we have had (which I can never forget) is a testament to this fact. He is the guy I'm sure everyone loves to be with and have nothing but admiration for him. An innate genius dramatist (though I have not been able to watch any of your performances :( :P) and academically excellent, he shall always be an inseparable part of my cherished memories of this phase of life. Thanks for being a part of my life in this campus and making it a memorable one. May the gods be with you and wish you a successful and contented life ahead. Farewell and keep in touch..!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>Ayush Sanyal aka Sanyal Babu is an incredible person I met during PS-1 in Tehri. He is a very nice person who is always ready to help without an itch. I wont forget the movies and 
TVSeries suggested by you especially DEXTER (Which is my favorite tvseries). I wont forget the way you imitated the others in Tehri especially Kamesh, Gadhiyal nd the P word :P.
We might have met late but i wont forget the moments spent together doing fun and masti. He is a good person to hangout with and is ready to go anywhere anytime. He easily makes 
friends and cares for them. Apart from academics he is a talented drama artist and is a member of drama club. He is a very calm and cool person. It's been good to know you and may I remain friends with you forever. I wish you great luck for your future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>

<p>It was courtesy Sudeep  that i met this guy in 3-1,and ever since he's become an integral part of our friends circle...I guess he's one of the people who you cannot dislike no matter what...a brilliant actor,he certainly blew me away when he essayed the role of Dr Frasier  in Malignant Humour(trust me he was like a completely new person on stage),he's soft spoken,very well read and of course his anecdotes(about other people in your corridor,films,books et al) are interesting,he's definitely a fun guy to be with......enjoyed your company to the fullest ayush...hope we do make time next sem too!!! all the best for your future and do stay in touch!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-ramanan">Paritosh Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Future kickass shrink / kickass corporate man, for sure. It's crazy that such a composed and serious exterior can go with such a fun personality. This sounds cliche, but it's kinda awesome how you deliver intelligent (and often hilarious) insights with a complete deadpan and a dash of the unique Ayush-Sanyal brand of humour. Especially in certain lectures. Your 'Raghu' was a revelation - was this the same quiet, shy Ayush Sanyal that disappeared after Big Break? It's a good thing you got to show off your talent in 3-1 (you still owe us a monologue, though). Thank you for making CN bearable and being my shrink and bodyguard and personal comedian and an awesome friend :-) We will keep in touch! 
PS. I have a friend who thinks you're charming and masculine.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>
<p>I still remember the first time I saw him. At the SAC,I was a minute late and He stole the room with the windows facing outside leaving me with the room I have now:P Great guy, always there to help me when i need something. Always calm and composed. I might have ended up missing many exams if he hadn't woken me. Sad that we have PS in different sem. Keep in touch.All the best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
