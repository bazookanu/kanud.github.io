<p>I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who enjoys attention as much as Ayush Sinha. It’s as if every move, every aspect of his behavior is carefully planned to garner as much attention from people in the vicinity as possible. But calling him an attention whore wouldn’t be apt – something like attentionphile would hit the mark. Because despite his almost desperate thirst for attention, Sinha is one of the most amiable and kind-hearted people I know. Like most of my friends, I got to know this bugger through Bogmalo excursions and we became very good friends after the great Bogmalo manhunt. We were MT-1 lab partners and that remains my favorite lab group ever: Sinha, me and Vaas – whereby the division of work was clear: I did the experiment; Vaas entered the readings and did the analysis; while Sinha styled his hair by using the voltmeter cover glass as a mirror and provided comic relief in all situations. We ended up coming 2nd in the batch - it was fucking brilliant and Sinha made the entire experience memorable. Mr. Sinha has been highly motivated ever since – he’s since taken to biology and aspires to being the world’s leading ‘genetist’ (Chutiye, geneticist hota hai woh).
He was my original Facebook muse (the other being his spouse, Chintoo) and it used to be my favorite pastime to make funny comments about his epic retarded photographs. Kinda disturbing, I realize, but you’ll be pleased to know that I have cut myself off Facebook and do not stalk him anymore. 
He’s an accomplished and very dedicated football player (self-proclaimed best captain the team has had so far) and I have tremendous respect for him regarding the same. Although, age is now catching up with him. Time to make way for younger blood, Sinha. Benny can outrun you by miles. So can Aman – and that’s saying a lot.
Ever since I’ve known him, Sinha’s been a financial train-wreck – always neck-deep in debt to almost all his friends, especially Nikunj (Niks, please note - yeh kamina tujhe abhi bhi paise owe karta hai and he doesn’t even fit the bill for your investment policy) But he has a brilliant charm which gets him off the hook every time. He’s a constant source of random entertainment and I envy his nature of not despising anyone. 
Ayush is one of my best friends and one of the most charismatic people I know. I will make yearly trips to Shimla after college to keep this friendship alive. Cheers, Sinha! Next year, hum saath mein birthday treat de rahe hai!
P.S. Bahut din ho gaye, aapki photo pe comment nahi kiya. Waise, Melange profile page ki photo mein aap anokhe chutiye lagte hain. :P

<p>Sinha ! Sinha ! Sinha ! Sinha , now if i have pleased the little attention whore in you I shall proceed. This douchebag of the first order is a cracker of a chap . The little champ, the wannabe Messi, I admit, is one of the most talented footballers I know in person and the best captain to walk that pitch ! P.S Mr.Ayush , wannabe Sachin is an #epicfail STOP ! To quantize our friendship would be just effin wrong. This kid is one crazy retard who is byfar one of THE MOST FUN to hang out with , Once you overcome that urge to push him off the cliff for being self appeasing twat , your day is set. He is one non stop bag of fun , he redefines "aayashi" and takes it to the next level.  This guy is definitely  one of the most charming and charismatic 'd00ds' I know and is one of those rare finds that have shaped who I am and made a dent in my life, I will owe you that forever.  Coming back to dear Sinha's other fixations, this chap tends to take the phrase "a mother's undying passionate love" too literally ;D Oh an d before iForget Sinha's the name politics can't be far behind and this guy takes pretentious politics to a whole new plane earning himself the nick "Sinha the Conspirator". He was a bunch of the pack waiting up all nighters for Sunday breakfast , until one of our dear friends made it too uncool for our c0olDuD3 to go to breakfast :D. The times I have had with you and Chintu and the Gang are definitely the most cherished  memories i will take back from my college days. It is needless to say this chap will make it big, and hell yeah Sinhu you can have that 51% stake for all I care. I won't ask you to stay in touch cause, you don't have a choice, I consider you one of my Brothers.  This Idiot is just a part of who we are and I wish nothing but the best for him. Here's too looking forward to many many many more  great times ahead and endless celebrations to come ! Lets bring this place down !

<p>Sinha,I think apart from height,he has been blessed with everything-wisdom,talent,smartness,oratory skills and a charismatic personality.Always the centre of attention,he is often ridiculed as an "attention whore",but I guess he wins that attention with a combination of charm,antics and a friendly disposition.Coming to the football side, I have to say,best captain ever,best striker ever,best co-player ever.Not only the guy has an encyclopedic(read Wikipedia) knowledge of football,but his wise and judicious application of that knowledge to our College football team game helped Bits FC attain new heights of success.I would never have played football for BITS,had it not been for Sinha,who encouraged me when I was dreadful in my first year.A master manipulator and brilliant man-manager ,he dealt with eccentric members of the team like me and Abin with great care and caution. A voracious reader of books,he genuinely commands great knowledge on almost every topic and his analysis,insights and advice on any matter is very measured and noteworthy.Extremely popular in campus,among both guys and girls,he comes into his own in the company of either Nikunj or Abhishek,and is always fun to be with.A Bogmalo celebrity and an underarm cricket discard,a fearful captain(at least for me when I missed training) and a fun friend,Sinha will always be remembered...I believe he will make it big in whatever field he chooses...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/asim-ali">ASIM ALI</a></p>
<p>Sinhe! Ayush Sinha has to be one of the most infections personalities i have ever met! With his SRK poses, hunger for attention, self praising ability and gossiping hungry nature, Sinha is always in the news (or well, always has something new to share :P ). Its an absolute pleasure to know a guy as simple and genuine as this. I remember meeting him in our first sem during the Pre-Spree futsal tournament and as I've told him several times, the first glimpse of footballing talent i saw in him was an effort from right around the half line of the basketball court, that flew right into the bottom corner. Sinha no doubt, is one of the best strikers I've had the pleasure of stepping onto the field with. An inspirational captain and sometimes even a motivational speaker :P Sinhe is one of my closest friends on campus and i'm really going to miss all his quirks. All the "Vaas yaar, pata hai kya hua..." either with a big smile on his face whenever he's looking to share a bucket load of gossip that he's acquired from his fabled "sources", or when he's really looking to talk about something that's on his mind. All the partying we've done specially in our third year, the football training sessions, Goa league, Manipal... The list is endless Sinhe. All i've gotta say is, never, never change! We've got a long way to go as far this is friendship is concerned and I hope it lasts a lifetimes! A big thank you for everything Captain sahab! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>During my first month on campus, I was Anubhav. Then this guy came to know my second name and kickstarted all the Sapera jokes and all the improvisations that have since happened to my name. A natural leader of men, it has been commendable how brilliantly he has marshalled his troops to take BITS-FC to the heights he has. His tactical acumen is something that deserves a lot of respect. His football has never been aesthetically pleasing to the eye :P, but the football team will vouch for his effectiveness on the football field. His shooting is what I am capable of admiring(owing to my limited knowledge of aspects of the game) , and I am a big fan of that.  Has brilliant oratory skills and boy, does he make good use of them to manipulate people, or as he would like to hear "woo" them. A big attention-whore, the biggest I have ever seen. His unnecessary shouting is irritating most of the times  and I fear for his life if Nachi ever gets offended by that :P. A natural at charming girls, its only because of him that football in BITS had been able to draw so much female attention lately. Shares my passion for driving, he owns the roads of Shimla and can help you attain a rally like experience in his 85-Maruti. Claims to be a Liverpool fan, though I have never had a chance to watch a single match by his side(because he doesn't watch them). A foodie to the core he knows how to live life to the fullest, even if that means staying in neck-deep debt all the time. Is a very very warm host. You must visit him in Shimla to experience that. Is a voracious reader and has immense knowledge about most of the subjects. Brilliant at mugging up Wiki articles. Is quite funny and spontaneous, one of the reasons why Nikunj has reached such heights with his jokes. He loves to act like a kid to draw all that attention but is a very very mature person. Is one person with whom you can share anything that is troubling you. Stay in touch always and put your immense intelligence to good use.
Be my chammak chalo :P
PS: FAILURE, I feel privileged to share my birthday with you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Screw it, I ‘m not writing this in 3rd person. Ayush man, you‘re one the best friends I have made in BITS. I know we haven’t spent too much time together because of our different friend circles and backgrounds, but I believe it’s the quality that matters. Everything important to me in BITS has happened to me with you beside me. Training, Spree, Manipal, Goa league, watching Salgaocar in the AFC cup, getting an offer from rising stars and playing football every day are all things I can never forget. For me life is football and you’ve been there to support it right from the start. Right from the beginning you’ve always encouraged and motivated me. You always believed in me when others didn’t. I always doubted myself but you made me believe. There’s been no one who has affected my football more than you. No one believed that I could be a winger, but you were ready to remove tavora from the wing to accommodate me. I know I always teased you about you’re captaincy and game but the truth is I really don’t think we could have achieved so much without you. You’ve been a brilliant leader to the team. I‘ve seen all the tough decisions that you had to make, the amount of time and money you spent, the politics you had to play:P, all  for the team  And you’re an amazing striker. Even your dip in form has never made me change my opinion. You’ve got a brilliant touch, brilliant curlers and a good left foot. I don’t say this often because I don’t want you to get overconfident and show off like you do always:P. I hope you’ll be there to help out the team next year, because we’ve worked hard to get the team to where it is now. And when I come back next year we can play together again. Till then concentrate on getting a good lead on the goals scored. I love you man. I will miss you a lot. Keep in touch!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Ayush! (ha ha haven't heard that one in a while have you?) So I started with thinking he is the most innocent person I have ever met. Now if I were to correct my former opinion I would say "SO NOT!" But in the nicest way. So to begin with if I were to point out the most prominent thing I noticed is that he is an amazing friend. Always there for his friends and what is more is never judgmental. Oh and since I am writing this I have to mention the insane Anjuna Diwali where you did your share of baby-sitting and of course the Little Chef day too... So I thought I would make it through this testimonial without a mention of football, because there is so much more to write about, but well I have to say all those matches we came to watch you play were so amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Goa League and of course the drinking that followed. Oh and uhm I think I should mention a tiny thing here your fear of dogs is very amusing. 
Best of luck with everything!

<p>Sininho, Cinna , Boobit, and finally Captain Sinha, a sparkling personality, amazing orator, brilliant footballer, excellent captain and a great friend. Sinha is truly a man of many facets, may it be the goalscorer of FA Cup 1990, or the girl Harry potter lost his virginity to, he knows it all (or claims too, Wikipedia FTW! ). I've known him since first year, he was this be-spectacled guy whose hands would constantly stray to his head, adjusting his hair, they say that once Sinha enters the washroom he scrutinizes his hair in every mirror until hes satisfied(which lasts for 30 seconds). A fellow foodie, and a party animal me and Sinha have made the best of the goan cuisine as well as the liqeur. Sinha also happens to be a brilliant leader, hes undoubtedly the best captain BITS FC has ever had, lifting a team that finished bottom to one that secured promotion. On and off the field hes one of the most sociable and amiable people I've come across. Another semester together, we're gonna have a blast my friend! :D Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
