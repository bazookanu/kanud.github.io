<p>Balaaji's greatness can not be described in words. Hence, this testimonial! :P
I first met Balaaji with Yafis, Tyagi & Bunty. The most knowledgeable man I have ever known. He is a walking Encyclopaedia.
The insatiable thirst for chess & the Looong chess matches between him and Yafis made him the Chess prodigy in his own way.
I still remember the first T1 paper in 1-1 - Thermodynamics, when we were getting some average marks around 43; he scored an outstanding 64 or something. Dude, you really have terrified me since then! Studying has been a cakewalk for him. His dream (?) of getting into Schlumberger left me frightened. (Obviously coz I am in EnI - te no hope branch) :P
Man, it was a privilege to have known you, & am sure you'll reach the greatest of heights in life.
PS: Am still confused whether he's from Bengal or TN.?!? :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
<p> We met in the 2nd week of first semester, and by conversing with him , i understood, he is no-nonsense guy . it was like we were friends from a pretty long time, we hit the right chord in our first conversation only. from then our ride was more like a roller coaster, the 2-1 scandal, when u were my only support, thanks for that bala.we can talk on almost any topic possible on this earth,Bala knows virtually everything, i have never found a topic or issue which he doesn't know about this guy has convincing power next to none.we had some night strolls in compre, where we talked about our future, and cursed bits education system.he was my alarm for most of the exams. he has a brilliant mind, and is extremely dedicated, thanks for motivating me always.i wish u all the successes in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurav-kumar">Saurav kumar</a></p>
