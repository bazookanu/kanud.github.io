<p>Barkha, where do I start from? She is a person you would really want to be friends with. Because the amount of dedication and sincerity she shows towards her studies (and believe me, she is one of those few not-nerdy yet studious types), she shows the same care and affection towards her friends and family. But hey, wait!! Having said all this, it's really not that easy to be friends with her at the first place. Initially, one would think she doesnt talk much. It seems justified to some extent. But the thing is, she buys time during that 'making friends' period. She observes you through and through, and if you match her sincerity standards (ohhh..and they are pretty high) you would be friends with her. For life. And then, the roller coaster journey would begin, and all your prejudice about her not talking/interacting much would be gone. She is a damn talkative person, and a really fun person to be around with. She would play pranks on you, pull your legs and in short, give you an awesome and hilarious time to remember all your life. But hey, I didn't promise she would always give you that really cute smile. She is also very emotional. Man. She really is. She works and studies passionately. She loves you with all her heart. She could sob like hell if you hurt her even a little, get angry at you too if you provoke her, yet love and care for you at the end of the day. Personally, she has been a life changer for me. Rather an alchemist, I must say. I didn't have much interest in academics until she arrived. Not only I found a change in my studies(and that was a drastic one), but a change in attitude towards everything in general. Her sincerity is really infectious, I must say. And with all those qualities in her, I am sure she would achieve her goals. All the very Best. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-bajpai">Vibhor Bajpai</a></p>
<p>It wouldn't be an overstatement if i say barkha is one of the most unique personalities i have ever met. Mature but childlike... samajhdaar but careless.She has all da opposite twin attributes.U might find her all thrown up at times, but inspite of all this shez a gem of a person at heart. A true friend, the most dependable person for almost anythin. You can always depend upon her for advice on nythin...she'll give u all da help u need... n even more. Barkha's''gussa'' is worth seeing... n all of u who havent experienced it once..should :P. Its a wonder how she perfectly manages her acads ( n non acads :P) n excels at both. My struggle thru cdc's wudnt hav been successful widout her. Alwayz update wid all subjects, she's a messiah for me in EnI (n to many oder too!). The cutest engineer :). Her diligent character inspires me(have never told her dat :P ) I have more confidence in her than I have in myself... n i know her never-giving-up attitude will take her places. I shall miss all da interesting talks dat we have in class... n da beautiful drawings drawn on classroom desks... n not to forget digilogica :P. I shall alwayz cherish this friendship... as a frnd lyk her wud be hard to find. Wish u all da best Barkha...I will alwayz be a phone call away from u. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/niharika-tiwari-">Niharika Tiwari </a></p>
<p>Smart, intelligent, dedicated, sincere, hardworking, beautiful, down to earth... these are the adjectives that come to my mind when i think about you. You were always my inspirartion to read before the exams, hats off to your sincerity.I first met you in physics-II classes when i thought that you are a very calm girl but now i know what the truth is (:P).You have a beautiful smile, always keep smiling. You look great in black. You are the person whom i can always trust upon. You are one of the most beatiful people I have known, and your beauty lies in your honesty. I had a very nice time with you specially in eiit and iic classes. I hope to have a very good time with you in PS-II. I wish you all the very best for your future. Have loads of fun in life.

<p>Barkha is my cutest and sweetest friend on campus. We were really close knit buddies in our first sem .. Most memorable were those days for me. Barkha is one such gem of a kind person. Among all high scorers , you expect a kind of Selfishness for marks. Barkha has conquered all those vile characterstics with her ever withstanding diligence and hardworking nature. She maintains a tough exterior expression ( trust me it scares ppl :P )  or it just happens out of her sincerity towards her studies. .. Trust me she is the most fun person to be with once she is done with her exams. Though JEE is long gone .. I bet she gives  and maintains the honor of being a student worthy of JEE selection .. Every exam she gives is like as if she is giving her JEE exam !!! Such a dedication she has towards her duty. I wish I stayed and studied more with you .. endured a little of your hardworking and diligent nature in my BITS Life .. :D No worries .. I'll take EnI classes frm u :P You are so nice person at heart and such a Fighter when it comes to execution of your duties ..  Lots of Love.. and Bright life awaits in future :) ... Wanna hear More ? Keep in touch :P   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>My first impression of Barkha was how can a person be so sincere and dedicated towards acads in college? Well met her during Chem I class when she used to be the only one to complete all the home assg given by the proff. In one way back then she motivated me do all those home assg (but sad I wasn't able to complete them ever).  She is fun to talk to once the class gets over.  Perfect blend of beauty with brains. With this attitude she will go places. All the best for the future. Keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>
