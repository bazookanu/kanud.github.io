<h1 class="page-title">Basant Sharma</h1><p>In a word : bigot

In less than a sentence : a bare blade

Basant is one of those people, who want to pursue their dreams and rebel against the norms and formality of the society. He doesn't want to fit in, but rather wants to make his own place with effort and dedication. His philosophy of education differs from the one in BITS, specially Mech. He could be seen attending classes for the sake of study and education than a piece of paper. He is also known to be shy amongst girls. People who know him, cherish every memorable moment spent with him, as do I.

I see you in ten years as :  successful scientist<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritwik-seshadeo-sahoo">RITWIK SESHADEO SAHOO</a></p>
<p>The guy we read about in books or see in movies. The one who wants to do what he wants. Wouldn't budge to whatever goes around him. As I say about him, "Allah ka banda" :D He is the person who likes just a subject or two in a sem, and would study none other. But in those chosen ones, anyone dare beat him :) This is what I like in him. I too think of doing it sometimes, but can't gather up the courage for it, seriously. He's the one whom I bore with music, the new songs I came across, the awesome guitar solos I've heard and what not. I've had many tiffs with him. Even hit him, but he never hit me back knowing the difference in power levels. :D Yaar, just thinking about the fact that one day we'll all be leaving just makes me wanna cry out loud. Bass. :'(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>The Scientist of our group. The way he does things,  the dedication he puts into his work always inspires me. But this only applies to the courses or jobs he likes, baaki sab jaen bhaad me! :P I can say, he doesn't fear anything and it takes courage to be such a personality.
He is a free thinker, but a child at heart. Has a new crush every sem( but each one is true love..haan) :D 
Cheers to you man! May you become a proper scaaitissttt/Prof at MIT one day. All the best. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-agha">AKSHAT AGHA</a></p>

<p>Isko jab dekhta hun, background mein gaana bajta hai "HUD HUD DABBANG!" aur saari dharti maano hilne lagti hai. Basant is one guy whose company I have enjoyed like crazy, however limited it has been! From the long talks about BITS to his mockery of my room's over-neatness, to his project work last sem, I have simply enjoyed it all. He told Nyati that I was a 2nd sem admit on meeting me because he had never seen me b4 that :P I wish him all the best for his future because awesome people like him deserve an awesome future. Enjoy! and keep smiling :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>The Dabang The Zanvar ! He is the guy who lives life on his own terms and will. He doesnt care about the world and doesnt follow the normal path to lead a just simple life. I remember when he didnt care to study some stupid subjects and instead would be reading some heavy maths or physics books, I would think kya banda he yaar esstud. I think he has attended more maths classes than I have this sem. Be it sharing food and fruits or cracking nonsense jokes, we have done it all, just he needs to bath daily. His thinking and his thought process is so damn clear, he is just a simple guy who is so friendly and caring at heart that one doesnt guess it when we look at his huge body. We have had awesome debates criticizing the sad sorry state of India, its politics and the fucked up education system in India, its always been a pleasure to see his neutral non biased attitude to such debates. He loves to share his knowledge and tries to learn whatever he cares for. He is that person whom I see daily and cant imagine not seing when he would be in PS, its just become a habit to talk to him and have a friendly fight with him. 
One line - He is a genuine fun loving stupid simple weird witty maniac . 
Be the same nice simple guy you are, learn and be that cool headed scientist one day India needs but still do make a promise to change that sad state of India. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Basant he is full of jokes ,fun and laughter.He is not very much into studies but whatever choicest subject he studies, he excels in it.He can irritate you with his practical jokes like anything but however much you try,you cannot remain angry with him for long.Our Guwahati vs. Delhi wars are legen(wait for it)dary!
Infact I always think God was graceful to give him a brother(GuruMeher) and  not a sister because he would have given her a hard tymmm with all his pranks!!...
And like some1 already wrote above, he is a romantic at heart and falls for a new girl evry Sem.. If only he would have taken a step further.... Anyways his "love stories" suffice as sources of laughter for us all along.....I need not reiterate the fact that he is lazy and loves to sleep at odd hours;but yeah he does manage to finish his chores and acads .... He clearly knows where his interests lie....
Just be the way you are-with a joke ready under your sleeve.....All d best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>"Mote" is wht all call him....n if you see him u will understand y :P. All he does is sleep n eat. People also say he is hard working, but when ever i see him, he is either eating or sleeping.He is a paneer addict, can live his entire life eating paneer!! Also a fruit lover, fruit wali aunty ka dhandha sirf iske wajah se hi chalta hai.......!! Says he doesn't have time for girls, but spends most of the time thinking, stalking (real world or fb :P) n even following girls, n also has a new crush every week. He also has great experience of giving interviews (in library :P). That was some insane courage which you showed. I could have never done that!! 

He is a very sweet n caring friend, but too lazy. When i went to his home, he used to take extra care of me n make me sleep for long, just coz if i get up, i won't let him sleep. He hates to travel or even go out, and has to be dragged out. At heart he is very simple n fun loving person. Down to earth, caring and also hardworking. He tries to portray himself as a bull or a ragging bull, but he can't, he is too sweet for tht :D.
One thing which not onli i but all love about him is his dedication to things which he likes. He won't waste time on things he doesn't like n concentrates on the things which interests him. Doesn't care about what others think about him or say, and that takes a lot of courage to do so. Bro, you have a long way to go......

Hope you find a sweet, fat girl soon :P

A friend for a life time, one you can count on.....will miss u mote!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>A wild SNORLAX appeared! Jokes aside, a very cheerful and bumbling-about blob of mass we all like to call "mote", our very own basant. A fine lad with a carefree yet staunch attitude(hard to come by these sort of people nowadays, dontcha think ). Don't let that foul body odour and the wacky sleep cycles fool you though, guy's a real hard worker, wont stop short of completing a project(read: robotics and/or machine learning stuff) he laid his eyes upon.  Have some important quiz tommorrow? Well screw you education I've my own plans! seemed to be his motto from the get-go( which I so happily embraced over time). Apart from having a thick skin(HAH!), mota is also very helpful and supportive when the need arises, more so if it involves someone of the opposite sex. He is also an ardent gamer, much to my joy, who would team up with me in mowing down hordes of evil pixels and virtual baddies in cooperative all-guns-blazing gaming sessions which would start around dinner time and usually last till breakfast.  A nice sport, but sometimes might come off as bit of a killjoy(Oi, who doesn't ! ), especially when it comes to humor :| My dearest friend, stay classy, never change...for many a laugh were had thanks to you, and thank god ki tere baaju mein kamra mila.  Will forever cherish those moments Mr. Sharma, the most roller-coastery 3 years of my life that I spent with you.
 <senti text> I say, let the light of our friendship burn  <insert enemy/rival here>'s eyes :D </senti text>
