<h1 class="page-title">BASANTI</h1><p>Before you read further, remember I am the 1st one to write a testimonial for you!! Tu kabhi muje samaj hi nahi payi :( 

My ex-girlfriend, though it never felt as she was :P And we can surely get an award for the "Best Breakup Reason of the Decade!!" :D

She is almost useless, but she is a part of DOJMA and have seen her name on some college newsletters so I suppose that she is good at it!! She is a tooo good friend, a friend with whom you can share everything, but never mess with her.....she is too good at hitting people!!

She is very hardworking, I have seen her trying to reduce her weight since I know her, though unsuccessful, she doesn't give up. Hope you achieve it one day nashine!! :D

I love calling her "Moti (= fat, huge or you can even say gigantic)", coz she is!! She has a very cute smile (generally all fat people have one) :). I love playing pranks with her, but have to be careful all the time, coz in return you can get a good beating. The most imp thing about her is that she the member of the food gang. If you can, then do ask her about her honeymoon plans------> Hilarious!!

Bahut hi bhulakad hai, phone karke bolo toh bhi ghar se kuch nahi layegi!!

Love you Nashine, will miss you n your beating!!

<p>She is the first friend I made on this campus and I am so happy to say that we are still such good friends. Our friendship has had it's ups and downs, ups mostly because she is just too precious. Whatever times we have spent together are all such happy memories. She is all over the happiest moments of my Bits life!! We have had almost every outing together and 3 years of my life have been spent being stupid and laughing together with this crazy chick.Her pace is a little slow and people she is not moti!! (She is just healthy!!!! :D) She is quite popular ( who can blame her with her brilliant name and cute smile and.... sorry got a little distracted :P ) She is a sweet innocent kid and can be smart and mature at the same time. She is very lovable and we may not agree on a lot of things but for me she will always be a very special friend. And there are too many conversations and times we have spent together to start listing.I know she isn't going anywhere and she has had a lot of practice now of talking on phone so she doesn't even have that excuse so we will keep in touch :P.  and there is no need to say that a chick called basanti is going to have an awesome, eventful and insanely interesting life!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>

<p>You are one of my first few friends on campus and one of the few I love the most :)
A brilliant personality and total chilled out girl ...  The drive at Mahabaleshwer was one of the best moments ;) , the whole trip for that matter. I love the fact that you don't mind me flirting with you (yyyaaayyy like i said totally chilled out). 
Amazing person to hang out with (esp because we like to do similar things unlike oldies who had come to Mahabaleshwar with us).... Like you mentioned we did not hang out much but I wish we would have, never mind we got another sem and I do not want to bid you farewell as I would wish to meet you even after we pass out from college, do some stupid 9-5 job, get married, have kids, grow old and die. 
Good luck for your future and I am sure you'll do well in life. Keep smiling always.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-ahuja">Varun Ahuja</a></p>

Bogmalo….Yes that’s the place we met for the first time I think. Or at least that was the first one that actually mattered.  You, me, bharat, kos, sumit, arushi, ayeesha…brilliant that we still stuck together, isn’t it? Over time you’ve only come off way cooler than was ever possible…You are just the perfect person to hang out with and are the sole inspiration to my attempts at keeping things light and cool, be it in acads, going out 5 days a week or anything else for that matter…The perfect mélange of fun, beauty, brains and sweetness you are one endearing person whom I would really really (and when I say really I mean yes…really ) miss.  But I am not going to say goodbye yet, because I look forward to having the best PS ever in Bangalore with you all. Let’s hope that we end up in the same block if not in the same company there :P Keep smiling (coz you look absolutely charming ? )   
With love, always =)

<p>nashine!!!.. I first met this complete fun-loving girl in the eni freshers n soon we bonded with dojma, eni field trips n all..Basanti is a real foodie loves trying out new places all over goa (I bet she has been to most of them) and sleeps a lot! All those crazy sessions when we stayed up n talked endlessly abt all the random things we could possibly think of have been loads of fun. She has a story and an opinion for everything and not to mention a very funny habit of moving her hands while talking. :P :D She is always laughing and giggling especially in the deco n analog labs we had together! ;) Its been great knowing you nashine! Stay in touch.. I know u will! M coming to Bangalore next sem! All the best for ur future! Good luck! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/disha-pramod-gujar">Disha Pramod Gujar</a></p>
