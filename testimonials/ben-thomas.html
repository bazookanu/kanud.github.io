<h1 class="page-title">Ben Thomas</h1><p>Mr Perfectionist. The most organized person i know ,smart, enthusiastic and little Mr innocent.
I might be the one of the very few people who has seen Ben getting mad,ask Abin he was lying on the floor with his hands on his head without even the slightest clue as to what hit him the last time it happened. Other than all that hes a pro at everything EEE. Hes a great teacher has helped me out a lot of times just  before the exams even when he had loads to study. Will never forget the times he raped me in all those aoe matches.A pro at whatever he does.
Hope u do well in ur future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>Ben thomas aka ben ten, ten thomas , RZ3 , robot :P is a calm,humble and well mannered guy. He is a full fledged nerd  (we call him EEE god ) and is very helpful especially when it comes to acads. He is also very good when it comes to coding and fast at grasping new things . His tastes and interests are very different from others which i feel is the mark of a genius :D .Apart from all that , he is a gamer and watches a lot of TV series. I wish you all the very best for your future.........<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vivek-g-kamath">Vivek G Kamath</a></p>
<p>A very calm, soft-spoken guy. Ben is a Pro , whether it is in acads , gaming or in coding. Apart from topping all coding related subjects, he is also a passionate movie and T.V series lover. He is one of those guys whom you never find studying but does extremely well in exams. Apart from putting up with my loud music which is played on full volume, my neighbour has also been a good friend for the past three years. It will be difficult to replace him. Wish you all the best for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nithin-s-poduval">Nithin S Poduval</a></p>
<p>_/\_. He is a perfect example of how appearances can be deceptive. When I first met him, I thought he was this very disciplined nerdy kind of guy. Over the past three years however, I learnt that he was anything but that. A fellow 9gagger :P he has an excellent sense of humour and knows how to make people around him laugh, with funny quips ( usually aimed at poduval, me or himself :D ). His attempts and anecdotes of learning hindi were some of the most hilarious things I have heard :D. He knows how to manage his time well, and excels at acads with minimum effort. He has aced his cdcs, with excellent grades in all of his cdcs, showing just how interested he is at eee. Does brilliantly in almost every damn lab exam, which shows he is anything but a mugger, and has a lot of practical knowledge :P. He is also a very good coder. I remember going to him before every CP exam and asking him about the mystery that was C to me, and he used to solve my doubts with a look of obviousness. Whenever you go to his room, you can see him sitting on his laptop, spending his time watching movies, t.v. series (watches/has watched most of the tv series released on dc) and anime or trying out some newly released game. Of the many qualities he has, the most admirable is his restraint and control over himself. Even though he is a mallu among many others in his (and my) corridor, he has ... ahemm... managed not to be like them at all :P (no offense to the others :D). Also his ability to attend classes at a stretch, however boring they might be. You can count on one hand the number of cdc classes he has not attended. With your knowledge and talents, you are destined for success. Keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-chandramouli">Varun Chandramouli</a></p>
