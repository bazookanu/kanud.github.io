<h1 class="page-title">Bhaavan Merchant</h1><p>Bhaavan ! One of the smartest guys I've come across. My go-to guy for any Linux related problem. He has taught me a lot and was there when I was just starting out. Thanks for being so patient with me ! One of the best coders on campus. Congrats for GSoc and \__________/  :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>

<p>Bhaavan...He is one of the few people on campus by whom I feel dwarfed. His knowledge in any Computer related topic is unparalleled. There were some epic moments when I had the stupidest of programming related doubts; and he would help me out humbly; and then, he'd laugh at me the very next second. :P 
Tall in his calm nature, tall in his perplexed & unparalleled Programming skills & knowledge, tall in his helpful nature and a wild drinker - traits rarely seen in the same person!
The wizard alongside whom I am fortunate enough to become a fellow GSoC-er. 
Man, it is an honour to have known you. I know you will reach the greatest of heights in your life - all because you deserve them!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Bhaavan..my fellow eni mate for the past 3 years,my lab partner for most of the time,its been an amazing experience getting to know him so well. A computer expert, his passion lies in coding and weird sleep intervals(:P); his roaming around fully fresh at 3 am in the morning is one thing i would definitely miss. A great jovial guy to be with, his helping nature is second to none and so is his chudaap, especially the most recent one(:P). No one deserved GSOC more than this guy here; its been my pleasure to have known you and of course, lots of time still- bangalore mein milenge hi ob!! All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>
