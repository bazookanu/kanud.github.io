<h1 class="page-title">bharat bhasin</h1><p>The coolest funniest smartest friend i ever had!!!! its impossible to point out one single flaw in him.....but thats probably because i am in LOVE!!! For all the grammar fuck ups, the punjabi/british english, the 'hoar' on the door!!! the awesome altec lansing speakers and innumerable poker hours!!! the insane test study night where we studied together and you sleeping when you were done and i sleeping when i saw you go to sleep!!! the hours and tons of money for the worlds best cold coffee.....the amazing drunken nights especially the ones with the pass outs...the thousand DJ nights and the insane discussions of scrubs. I manage to only scratch the surface...........you are the best friend i ever had and its been the best 3 years of my life..........and believe you me when i say that i couldn't top of a friendship like this in a 100 years!!! Cheers Bharat...never change! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kaustubh-suresh">Kaustubh Suresh</a></p>
