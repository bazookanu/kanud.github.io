<p>Baaaa!!!!One of my beeest buddies!!!!Calm, cool, composed, talented, intelligent, lively, caring, witty….aarrghh…it’s gonna be a never ending list.
It was Satwik who introduced me to Bharat, as co-“IS” person. It was thru our hostel Telugu gatherings that I came to know him better, can never forget the many trips (mynapi, bike trips, dono paula….). Even though his room is in AH-5, he used to stay in AH-4 all the tym…that’s one of the reasons why he is very close to all of us and dear to us.
It was in 2nd year that we became close due to the many classes we shared. It was always fun to share those lil jokes and secrets with him during class hours (will miss all those baa :( ). It was in 2nd year, when baa, sk, govind, Deepak and I started hanging out together. I can never forget those awesome trips and dinners we all used to go on, the never ending discussions, pranks and loads of other stuff!! Epic moments of my whole 2nd year!!
Hey, do u remember the morning of the day of registration in 2-1?? :D :D….one memorable moment.
Bharat is an extreme sports person…a \m/ volley ball, badminton, cricket player. One fit and healthy guy!!!
His dressing sense is a remarkable feature, I’ve no idea how he knows a lot about what to wear, when to wear….he’s best at it….It was always him, whom we asked for dress suggestions. 
He has immense knowledge about anything on this world…may it be movies, politics, songs, tv series ….I dunno how does this guy manages his acads sooo well, inspite of involving into many other things(dora, sports, fun) and watching many TV-series, movies. He is one other techno-geek I’ve seen in the campus, totally into checking out new mobiles, laptops, technologies…he’s a mini-dictionary of all such stuff.
Well well, in short he is one awesome person with every quality that people would love to have. His fans and the huge social circles he maintains justifies the statement.
One thing I respect the most in him is, his love for his family members and all the close ones. \m/\m/
It was an amazing journey, with you in BITS. Will cherish all those moments may it be SE project, GAN presentation, the La Paz dinners, IS classes, watching movies until late nyt or the long walk on the highway, the auto journey from Panjim, going to Panjim for EEEP project material and many more.
Writing this testimonial made me realize that it’s just few more days that this stupid is going to stay in the college..i’m gonna miss u alooot  :( :( 
All the best for the bright future ahead baa!!! Do stay in touch (unlike the summers). Love u loads!!!
