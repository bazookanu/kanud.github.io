title: Bharti Chhabra

<h1 class="page-title">Bharti Chhabra</h1><p>Well sweet and vivacious are the two words ill prefer using for her. Still remember the first time I came across her... 1st sem itself... She asked me a doubt and all I could notice was her beautiful smile. I have known her for the past 3 years and I could say that she is one of the nicest things I have. For all those who don’t know her never EVER bring the topic of Faridabad being a GAON..it will turn her Haryanvi genes on and I can’t guarantee what will follow next ..Otherwise she’s good to everyone. Simple, sweet and a fascinating human being with ZERO attitude. If you ask her she will tell you that she likes to travel but in real she is quite boring.. Seriously if it wouldn’t have been  me “kya hota tera”. At times very dominating, I am telling this from my personal experience. But overall it’s been nice knowing you had an awesome time, When we first talked to each other
I knew we would always be friends. Our friendship has kept on growing and I'll be here for you to the end.
be the same always..!!
Wish you all the best for your future

<p>First thing u'll notice about her is that she's sincere, an extremely determined person and focussed..an ever present smile, a sense of innocence.Got to know her really well only in the last few months...The 1 very good thing abt her is isse kabhi gussa nahi aata.....Atleast I have nver seen her angry or pissed at someone... Here's to being friends for a long time to come :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikunj-sharma">Nikunj Sharma</a></p>
<p> I met this girl right on the day of our admissions though got to know her better only in second year ......! A perfect combination of "beauty and brains" ..this girl will always say "kuch nahi pada hai ...but will still get an av+"....!!!Helped me a lot with departmental work and she actually was one of the most dependable persons i got to work with ......!!!Hates it when some one derides her beloved "branch" or says that her dear hometown is a "backward village ".....:P!!!Good to everyone and sufficiently helpful ....!!!!!!All the best for your life ahead .....always stay happy ...:)!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-choudhury">Rahul Choudhury</a></p>
<p>A lot of people consider you a perfect example of "Beauty with Brains", i wont comment anything on beauty aspect but I can definitely ascertain the brains part of it... You've a very sharp mind and you know when, where n how to use it ( this applies to aspects other then studies too :D ).. You're the most promising, determined and focused girl I've met.. It can take ages to develop charisma you currently possess. Have a great life bharti, Best of luck for all your future endeavors...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

HITTER.. sehwag... n i don’t know how many nick names i have given you.. :)  i remember the first tym we met .. near the common room.. u sounded quite friendly n introduced me to ishita.. ( u used to wear thick framed specs den... :D). We became friends in 1-2 and since then our friendship has come a long way... the bond we share has become stronger  n stronger..  now coming to the point i.e me talking about u.. i would like to start by saying that u r the heart throb of i don’t know how many ppl in campus...  :D ( job hi dekho use apni bhatti pasand hoti h.. :P) a perfect combo of beauty (hotness.. :D) and extra sharp brains ( photographic memory, unlimited data storing capacity, THE MEMORY STICK of our group). I seriously cant understand how u can remember all mobile numbers so easily :O i must really say that u r such a sport.. no matter how much  ever i make fun of u ( about your Amitabh Bachhan like  BARITONE :D, or your hit ratio or any other matter out of the N number of things.. :P) u have never felt bad about it and have always taken it wid a sweet smile on ur face.. :) u r a really practical, very very systematic ( i don’t know how  any 1 can iron each n every cloth and stack it up in the cupboard in the neatest n cleanest possible way.. :O).. highly helpful.. (ready to do the utmost from ur side to help others) , caring and loving gal.. :) (always consoled me about so many things.. :P) how cant i mention about ur wierd time table.. :P :D getting up at 1pm (when i cum back frm classes.. :-// ) sleeping at 3 in the nite.. and then exam bhi phod kea a jati h.. pta nhi kis mitti ki bani hui h.. :| one of ur best qualities is dat u r not at all egoistic.. always the first one to say “sorry yaar... bura mat manio plzz..” :) u are a bit bore sumtyms :P (as in.. u don’t crack silly jokes... n u know my age old complaint.. u don’t say “YO MAN” which is the punch line of our group.. :P :D) but still u r fun to be wid.. ur laughter is really peculiar.. n specially raat raat ko chudailo ki tarah hasti h.. ( not letting me sleep :-// ). Knowing a person like u has been a great experience.. :) u r an awesum person..  a perfect combo of all the gud qualities be it beauty, brains, nature n all blah blah blah things but only thing is dat u get readily influenced by others.. iske alawa everything is simply 10 on 10.. ;) :D luv u yaar.. one of my closest buddies in collge.. i cant feel and believe that there are  just 15 days left wid u in campus. :( ur presence will be missed badly yaar BHATUUUUUUU.. luv u lottttttttt.. :-***** <3 always kep in touch.. :) i wish u all the very best for future.. thats pretty obvious that success will always be urs.. ;) wishin u loads of happiness... :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/divya-nayak">Divya Nayak</a></p>
<p>There are always those people who succeed somehow yelling about life,there are obviously those  who just crib.. and there are a few who just spend their life smiling, working with patience whenevr needed, coz they have a lot of self-confidence and determination to take them down.. Bharti is one of those few.. Shes the perfect example of how one should keep a balance..coz she always knows what shes doing, and even what others are doing.. I really admire her for it..!! although sumthng sumthng kept on going, and somehow we were never able to be too close (i really dont blame any differnces, just the situations, and u know what i mean :P) I really love how both of us shared that understanding to never keep those things from the many corridors interaction we have (especially in nights) ..it was always talk to you about anything and everthing..!! Shes beautiful, very good in carrying herself, her sense about things is incomparable, intelligent (hell of a mind gal..!! ) and yaa the cherry on the top is her sweetness and helpful nature.. seldom can we find a girl with such a personality and so down to earth..!!! Shes a very gud friend, coz even when shes not comfortable, she wont leave u alone, always baking u up when in need..u can talk to her for ages about eveything..coz she always has a lot of info to share..!! Always ready for having fun, shes a very happy go lucky kind of a person..!! I am sure that u ll get whatever u desire from ur life..coz with ur determination and abilities to manage, u dont require anything else..!! Hope that u have a great life ahead..!! Just keep smiling like u do now..!! Cheers gal..!! Luv you..!! :) :)

<p>Hmm ... Bharti ..!!   One of the most Intelligent girls around here on campus . Very practical, mature and at the same time friendly and kiddish ... crsly ... Its always nice to have someone like you as a frnd to walk with ... The countless IS talks ... The trip to old goa with you and other IS fellas will always be rememberd as one of the best ... Many moments where we laughed on the same wierd jokes in IS classes that we hardly attended ..  Guys ... she is the best person to go to when you want to convert your grade from E to B  ..  Been there done that ...  M sorry for all the things you have to hear after that ... ( Chal hawa aan de...ab !!  )  EEP lab was also interesting .. specially the soldering part where I managed to excel so bahot bhav khata tha tere project mai help karne mai .. :P  . All the time in vacations .. one of the person who will always be online on fb at 3 o clock in the night ..!! In all the treats and parties .. the first one along with me to order MASALA papad ..!!  :P And now , since it will be almost the last of times that we are meeting each other .. I hope the best for you in life and be confident in what you do ...  your own ideas will take you forward  ..and take u r stage fear out as you may have to stand many a times in future  :) ... And finally all the best with Microsoft ...!!
