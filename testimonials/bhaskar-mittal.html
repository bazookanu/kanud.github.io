<h1 class="page-title">Bhaskar Mittal</h1><p>Bhaski.. my best friend in goa... met him on the first day itself... gt acquanted very quickly.. and nw currently he's one of my bros here... he's gt a high IQ... has an overflow of grey cells... i wish i could borrow sum frm him...!!!
bhaskar is known by two things... first is robotics... yes he reminds me of dexter from dexters lab... is a professional in robotics.. also has won a couple of prizes in quark 2012...(that reminds me he still owes me that treat!!! :P)
secondly, guess guess..... u r correct... his hair!!! :D
i mean seriously which guy takes 5 mins to comb his hair??? makes me impatient when i am   dying of hunger anxiously waiting to go to the mess!!
besides all the co-curricular activities he's amazing in studies as well... a favourite student of many teachers (hod onwards downwards).... 
nature wise he is pretty straight forward... speaks out his mind... and does not hesitate to present his opinion however contrary others might think... thus he stands for himself and does not follow the "crowd mentality".... i like his attitude towards life!!
I am sure he might be a role model for all his BE students in the Microprocessor Lab... judging by the fact that they always crowd in his room asking doubts!!
Wishing him the best of life for his career... i am sure he's gonna do amazingly well in the future!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-baokar">Ishaan Baokar</a></p>
<p>Think about meticulously hardworking nerds. And think about Bhaskar Mittal! Well, the contrast couldnâ€™t have been harder. It might sound like he is one of the 7P guys. 
But he is not. [To all the juniors who think he is actually a 7P. Put him in ur class if u want to see what an unachievable CG looks like!]
Total fun when he pulls people's legs [Don't get too happy. You might be his next target]. Half the B.E. projects are done by their very own 'Bhaskar Bhaiya' [Hope the  
faculty never find out they are not the only reason their students score good grades]. Has an eagle eye for the most ordinary details of life or things that seem  
insignificant to most people.. Very good at debugging and quick-fixing. He is an epitome of social grace [Ash him how to eat a rasgulla]. He will be up till 4 in d morning  just to help out juniors with their projects or clarify his friend's doubts [in subjects he is not even registered in]. He has something on his mind, he comes straight to the  point with no shillyshallying.. No deceptiveness.. No pretentious smile.. No diplomacy.. He wouldn't hesitate to show his utter disapproval on matters he doesn't  approve of or situations he finds intolerable. N its total fun to get into an argument with him but u have to finally give in just to get some 'inner' peace. The immense  amount of enthusiasm and passion he has towards anything that catches his interest, for all you know, He is going to go a long way. Some fondly call him "Bhaskar  Bhaiya" for others he is "Bhaskie".. Not because he can make a pink and purple robot which moves on black lines but because u hav dis confidence dat happen what  may, he is jus a call away! Always hav dat twinkle in ur eyes which you hav when u see ur 'bot' moving.. Gd Luck! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-uddadi">Priyanka Uddadi</a></p>

<p>Bhaskar Mittal aka "lost Pilani Guy in BITSG" aka MUP God. :) He is one of my best friends in the campus and also a TA mate. :)  "Haan haan kyun nahi" is the most frequently used sentence by him. Keeping jokes apart, he is well known for his hair style and his robotics projects. He is very talented and intelligent when it comes to studies, he is a quick witted and fun loving guy. He is also very helpful and cooperative in nature. I will always remember all the trips we had, campus walks, ishaan ki milke khichai. :) Wish you a very bright future, dude. :) cheers, amigo. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhruv-vyas">Dhruv Vyas</a></p>
