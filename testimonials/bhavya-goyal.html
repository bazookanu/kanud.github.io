<h1 class="page-title">Bhavya Goyal</h1><p>She is the one who values friendship to the core. Most innocent girl I have ever met in my life. She is kind, caring and most important of them all, she is true to herself. She is always ready to help out her friends, no matter how rude they may be at times, but she takes all that in a stride. She loves working for Abhigyaan, and is a devout member of Arts & Deco. I have never seen anyone work so sincerely as she does. She is intelligent and inherently sincere (likes to sleep a lot though :P) . Her simplicity is admirable, and takes us to a world of her own where we all are small kids away from hustle and bustle of life. She is soft spoken, yet strong at heart. (This might not seem apparent). A person of her caliber is bound to succeed at whatever she does. I wish her all the best for her future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>

<p>: Bhavya.. remember our first meeting... you came to us while we were on stairs, asking something and then you said “ok..so now I have got three friends”..After that formal conversation, I never thought we will be such good friends... we didn’t spend much time together, but still the bonding we share is well knitted... We have discussed so many things... be it Chiku, studies or life... Your dedication in abhigyaan and ArtsnDeco is really admiring, the way you manage studies and all this is inspiring... A very tough ( those burns, cuts, bruises... sweety.. :P), but very soft and sensitive girl, one who loves Maths like hell.... Our trip to Japanese garden, masti in corridor, dresses, holi... teri ghar se laayi huyi cheezen... (yummy... ? )... ma’m, everything was a great moment altogether.... Sometimes, i seriously felt that you are way too beautiful... (rem that Prom night... , Teri wo pic.. and many mre).... Someone is really lucky... (ob.. we are... :P), One girl who is very concerned about her brother, and who doesn’t take care of herself at all.... Such a great painter and truly chemical girl.... be as you are... so sweet, simple... and dedicated... make sure to be in touch.... n Madam, we have to once go for shopping rem... kab se plan cancel ho raha h.... take care... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>

<p>Bhavya-b.g. to me- is a a very smart,loving and caring girl.In addition to d normal days, the outings that we had together are worth remembering.Bagha wd the fear-of-water;Majorda wd the go-karting-closed;Martins at the end-of-sem; Netravali wd the fear-of-"you know what";Old Goa Church and your random unexpected pics;Vasco wd the shopkeeper-asking-why-we-call-u-beegee and quite recently Bogmallo and Claudis wd my-sis-in-a-tow.. the list is endless.... With you next door to me, we had innumerable memories.. Like those nights I would knock on your door for "some food" and whats more-you always had a feast ready :) and ya chosing a song of the day... and the tyms U weren't feeling well and I used to barge in and bore you wd all my medicines and Bio knowledge...and the tyms I wasnt well-and you had d perfect home-remedy for me-some heeng or Neem leaves(u personally picked them for me- so sweet of you)... Your laptop inauguration, our first prom dresses,and  the night we decided to watch "exorcist" in the hope of getting scared but instead we were getting bored,d tyms i confused you whether I am crying or laughing, the cleaning of rooms-u zharoo & me pocha-d sealing of ant holes with soap...must say the list is endless..... Truly B.G. we created some wonderful memories to last us a lifetime.. I hav always found you calm,composed and dedicated to work and duty... U understand people very well,know how to take charge of situations.. Hope you remain the same.. wish you luck...... Yours Mimo <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
