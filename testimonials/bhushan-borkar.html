<h1 class="page-title">Bhushan Borkar</h1><p>When I first saw Bhushan, he seemed like a weird person. Well, he was the BITSAT topper of our batch in campus! One of the only people I know who used to tuck a tshirt! Very introversive(a lot more than me even!), highly intelligent and  really soft-spoken( so soft you have to usually use ARQ to understand what he says :D). Over the past three years, I have seen him change a lot, for the better I feel. Although his cg has fallen slightly, he has become more social and ‘less weird’( :P ), considering he also started copying assignments and studying at the last moment! He is always ready to help if you have a problem in acads. He is especially good at math, programming and logic. All the best Bhushan, you have a bright future ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>He is the epitome of SIMPLICITY. I had a great time with him during POM. Those weird class activities, presentations and what not. People who know him, respect him a lot because of his humility and intelligence, which is a rather rare trait on campus. I am  always going to remember that he helped me take a printout in his room when I was in a hurry, thanks for that. All the best for the future, which I'm sure will be awesome. Don't ever change and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Poker face..Dont go by his demeanour, some of the conversations with him can only be described as class Machiavellian.So, it's always better to be on his good side.After my endless discussions with him in the first year, topics ranging from mapping Iraq,sabotaging human weaknesses, to the more sane CP1, CP2 programming discussions ,I am quite sure this guy has a long way to go.That chess game was inconclusive so we are still on buddy ;)
That reminds me you really need to work on your openings,and me on my middle game.He is a very humble person,I agree and generally good at what he does.(Remember the puppet workshop, u figured more of the working dynamics than the puppet master :) Probably that what pissed him and he called you on stage ;)).He is also good at giving advices like dont watch 3 movies in a row when you have a workshop  compre tommorrow , no wonder that fetched a D.All being said and done,it's always fun challenging you, have a great time.All the very best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raunak-sharan">RAUNAK SHARAN</a></p>
