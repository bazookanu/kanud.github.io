<h1 class="page-title">Bibhu Ashis Jena</h1><p>Bibhu.. I can't believe we were almost like strangers with each other for more than an year inspite of being classmates. He looked like someone who would look at girls and say "Useless creatures..inko toh CS khelana bhi nai ata" I was so sooo wrong. He is the Mr. Solution-To-Everything of our class. Lost ID card, don't get what teachers teach, too many papers to check, servers down, birthday bumps dena hai, anything and everything, U ask him and there he is, always game to help (Game to kick for birthday bumps) :) I wonder how he knows everything without even attending classes..Hostel me padhate ho kya??:P Teachers teach their own subjects but Bibhu can teach u everything. Be it Presentation or explaining any problem from any subject, teaching is in his genes. Never says no for anything, so full of positivity and energy. Dashing, Brainy, witty, sweet, add to all this an awesome sense of humour..and Thats Bibhu for u..:) Very few people have that zeal, determination and potentials of following their dreams and you r 1 of them. I m sure u r gonna be what u r meant to be. Be the same, get everything that u want and have an amazing life ahead..:) All the best..\m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mallika-desai">Mallika Desai</a></p>
<p>Here is the guy of born creativeness, who is very much dynamic in character (Body guard, Angry Young Man, ..). He has been like an elder brother to me. Whenever i m sad or frustrated he makes me forget everything and gets a smile on my face. He is a gr8 person to chill with...if u r in any problem he is gonna fix it. He is a sincere, mature, with great sense of humor (but we say it his anger) and serious (now a days)..He can give you the best advice and lectures when you really need them..or even when u don't ;)..One word will explain this "BABA JI"..he spent 50 minutes for a presentation of 5 slides...he is intelligent, smart, brainy and with knowledge of each and every domain..he has taught us what even teachers can't explain in the class and made us clear the exams. He is a good at drawing. He plays almost every sport. He is passionate about eating. He is kind of those friends who are not gonna leave you till last breath...and even when u tell them to F*** ***..his problem is his negativity..but remember "The harder you fall, the higher you bounce"...lucky to have him...he is one of my best buddies..wishing him a blessed life ahead..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankush-khurana">Ankush Khurana</a></p>
