<h1 class="page-title">BONAGIRI SRIMAN</h1><p>Hahahahahahahaha. Thats what happens when u want to talk with him. he is a maniac laugher and just keeps laughing for about anything. 
A fun loving , cool guy , great lover of telugu movies , passionate and a dumb ass.
What i hate in him most is he is always "Early to bed, early to rise" , Dude, thats against a bitsian rulebook. Jokes apart, he is always cool to hang around with and one of the best persons i have ever met. He always is  two steps ahead of us in trying something new.
I know you have a great time ahead. All the best buddy.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-gupta-akirala">Tarun Gupta Akirala</a></p>
<p>sriman, ur dressing style is _/\_ .u laugh at everything no matter what. u always want to do something new and u did many (from doing very different items in ur room to what not). u have many crushes and u spoiled evy1 of them in a new way. another thing about u is u always say l8. u r a damn lucky person (poker). u never get angry and r humble, honest and a good friend of mine. i liked hanging around with u. i hope u will do something new in ur life and live a dream life. all d best for ur future. keep laughing. \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krishna-murthy-b">Krishna Murthy B</a></p>
