<h1 class="page-title">C V  Bharani Krishna</h1><p>“Aur B@#% wassup........”. Bharani is a fun guy with a good sense of humour. Super lazy to do work but **** *** k kaam karna sikha diya. Class sab li8 sleeping is important. His try to avoid coke and diet plans all fail. Cannot resist food. No compromise in eating. Had loads of fun in many trips and in the labs. A great guy to hangout with. Nature wise very humble. He’s great with people. All the very best for future!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>He is one person who will make you feel comfortable. A warm person who's always hugging other people :P
It's not easy for me to get along with people easily, but with him, very little effort is required. A matter-of-fact person, intelligent and is normally helpful. While his diet plans and kicks on the wall apart, knows his stuff and balances things well.
Hope you have a amazing time of your life :)
All the Best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>Bharani is a fun guy to hang out with and never lets people around him be bored because he always has a joke to crack. He is extremely helpful, so helpful that you sometimes feel shy to ask him for favor coz he is always ready to do anything for you (not literally though :P ). He is a great guy and is an encyclopedia of gadgets and mobile phones and thats why he is the perfect person to consult if you are buying a new phone. We had great fun during the trips, treats, labs and classes man but i'm scarred it's over. I hope you have a great future and excel in what ever you do. All the best!!

<p>This chocolate boy(for ladies :P) is a true friend. Will always help you and never leave your side whatever may be circumstances. Had lot of fun together in labs, IC and of course our download sessions. All  the "bio" trips would have been incomplete without you. A real kind hearted and humble person, wrote most of the part of the "ecology" report himself while I did the less important work. Currently on a crusade to achieve excellence in android and linux stuff. Best of luck for that(but you know what i really think of it 8-D). Takes no tension about anything, eating(equivalent of 4 ppl) and sleeping are the thing that he does best. Best of luck for your dieting plans and also the Jason Statham dream  ;) .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>

<p>"Aur chakke" this is how our conversation starts. Good things take time and Bharani is no exception. he takes his own sweet time to do things and gives good results. Those who befriend him are blessed as he puts his friends first. An expert on computers, android and linux, one can always depend on him for help with troubleshooting and suggestions for good apps. He is fun to be around and hangout with. He is a pro games and a football player. His dedication to loose weight is appreciable :P. His sincerity and dedication to his goals make him unstoppable towards his success. All the best man!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
