<p>Writing about people whom you know the most is a tough job because you cant decide where to start off with. Prasanth or Parsu as I like to call him has been my dearest companion in this most epic journey of Engineering. There have hardly been any days when I havent spent time with him in his room. He is an embodiment of patience, virtue, dedication  and sincerity.  His extraordinary focus and his love for studying(yes people, I am not kidding....he actually loves to study!!!) has ensured that he always topped in academics. He never shirks away from helping people, especially when it comes to clearing doubts. His tolerance is just unbelievable, he can just about put up with even the meanest person in the world. He is a very strict follower of the famous line "Silence is Golden". His interest in football was what made me watch and follow it and go on to become a fan of it. He is a workaholic and never loses focus on the work at hand. I am really really lucky to have a friend like him. A one in a million person for sure. Wish you the best for your future dear friend :)))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>Prasanth, the first word which comes in my mind for you is God Like. I had never seen such a dedicated personality before. Working with you in PS was a wonderful experience. Dude you have a lot of patience. Getting stuck up in Leg Up , I would do some time pass but you could sit there breaking your head over it for hours. How can you be so consistent? How can you be so passionate about whatever you do. An ideal Geek and also an ideal nerd, you are  a very good friend of mine. I thank my PS for it. I got to learn so much from you..perseverance , tolerance , patience (with the report which Sir wanted us to modify so much) , passion and what not! And I always love to take the credit.. I taught you how to enjoy life :P . Life is beyond books and beyond FIFA too :P . Trip to Rishikesh Dehradun and Delhi were \m/ .  Because of your  transparent view about life,your honestly and humbleness I have  evolved  high respect for you . You have been such a great friend , a mature advisor ( your timely advices have been life saving for me everytime)  and a great support for me. Thanks a lot for being so. I am so proud of having a friend like you.  May God uproot all the hurdles of your life and may you move on and achieve every great thing life has in store for you. All the best . Stay in touch :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>It is a wonder that anybody knows 

anything about this guy at all, 

considering that he rarely opens his 

mouth to exercise his voice box. 

Always the guy who wouldn't let you 

know he is there, Sai Prasanth is an 

extremely shy person who always runs 

away from the spotlight as fast as 

possible. I remember him as the 

silent guy whom I met in first year, 

not wanting to speak at all, Sujay 

doing the talking for himself and 

Prasanth put together :D Thank god 

that he's opened a bit and speaks his 

mind freely at least in our group. An 

absolutely brilliant person, the 

sheer amount of passion this guy has 

for some of our CDCs is remarkable. 

Leave alone EEE/EnI CDCs, Prasanth 

actually attends CS CDCs if he is 

feeling inadequate. Probably the only 

guy in our group with something 

approaching a double-digit Emotional 

Quotient, this guy is quietly and 

intensely philosophical about most 

things. A complete football freak, 

the only time you can probably hear 

him in full flow is when he is 

discussing a match. If there was a 

Nobel Prize for patience, he would 

definitely win that prize for 

tolerating Munna in his room for 

record intervals of time. He is an 

amazingly humble guy, extremely 

modest, down-to-earth guy who is 

always ready to help you out in 

whatever it is you need helping out 

in. In other completely unrelated 

info, his Hindi is hilarious to 

listen to :D He is a real gem of a human being, and I am extremely proud and honoured of the fact that we are such good friends.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>

<p>Eni would have been so difficult if it was not for him!!! A great guy and friend . His laid back attitude towards most things is what impressed me the most. He is very hardworking, and very very helpful. The entire eni batch would have had a difficult time if it were not for his notes( we all owe you big time for that). We share a common interest in soccer but he follows it more religiously than I do. He has some great technical skills which are sure to take him a long way in life.  All the best for the future, stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>pehli baar hum mt1 ke lab mein mile the. tab se bande ke liye respect tha. by far iske group ka proest banda. zyada baat nahin karta and that is what seperates him from the crowd. he had a share of personal problems but fir bhi dekho acads mein phodta hai. iske saath mt2 makeup labs karne mein sabse zyada maza aaya, mostly because mera apna group bakwas tha. library wala incident yaad hai na boss? jab ladki ne tera phone no manga tha aur mujhe aur raju ko ignore maar rahi thi( naam nahin lunga but i think it is pretty obvious). bina bole patana koi isse seekhe. bhai main cs mein hoke isse kam aco jaanta hunga. bande ko interest cs mein hai aur acche accho ki maar sakta hai usme. i wish you the best in life, tension mat le tujhe ultimate todu bandi mil jayegi in the near future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Sai Prasanth (or Chintan Jalani like I called him for nearly a year n he never corrected me! Seriously!! Itna kaise shy hai tu! ) Prasanth is a smart, very kind and helpful person sincerely attending all the boring eni classes and taking down notes and then generously allowing us to take pictures of it and circulate them around. He is THE ULTIMATE ENI SAVIOR! :D Its been fun having him around in the cdc classes and wish u good luck for ur future! Stay in touch :)
PS: those comments on ur notes were hilarious! :D atleast made a boring subject like iic entertaining!

<p>One of the most down to earth and selfless person I have ever met.Came to know this guy properly during PS.Super pro at comp science and coding and does only what he likes.The team Solomon member,who used to work frantically day by day at Ceeri-- man you used to be so tired by the end of the day at Ceeri.Calm and a silent worker,he knows really many things.Yet he has lot of interest for some TV series called 24 which infact he watched continuously for 23 hrs to complete it (_/\_) .. Your humble attitude and helpful nature,may you remain same throughout life.Was fun with you during PS.Hope you would prosper throughout your life.Best Wishes.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shabbar-a--vejlani">Shabbar A  Vejlani</a></p>
