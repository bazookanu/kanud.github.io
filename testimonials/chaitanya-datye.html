<h1 class="page-title">Chaitanya Datye</h1><p>Datyeeeee....your surname would be as famous as anyone else's on campus, thanks to Pritish Gudge. You have been a really good friend and an awesome person to just hang around and chat with. Your down to earth nature will help you go a long way ahead in life. Your wide smile and your unique voice is something that I will remember whenever I think of you. You will be missed by many people on campus, bu perhaps the person who will miss you the most will be the librarian ;) I am sure that you will be a very successful person in life, all the best for your future journey!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>"Sorry my friend is coming..". I didn't know him before we came to bits, but he knew me and that first statement didn't sit well with him. But now I'm glad we became friends, best friends. Datye is unique is every possible way. He is extremely hardworking,very friendly and kind, but above all, he is a genuine person. Never gets angry, goes out of his way to help others and will always be there when you need him.
I will always the remember the epic TT battles we had, the time we spent in the library(notice the "we"),me teaching you CP and you teaching me everything else(even now) and the tiny amount of bitching :P. But I will never forget that chem-1 class when I shooed away a stranger and gained a lifelong friend. Kudos to the IS GOD!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>The guy who eats, sleeps, lives in library! I actually can remember bumping into him every single time I was in Lib. A very dedicated student, who always attends classes and excels in Acads, did a Great Job as the Backstage Co-ordinator. Also very few people know that he has been to 26 different countries!! Datye is surely a friend for Life!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>Chaitanya Datye,.... though many times I do forget his first name :P.. Lot of people even might not even know his first name..So Datye it is for me and it will be for me always because  I have gained his friendship for life now.My first mulaquaat with him was just outside Ah4 on a bench at around 12 am in night. The little chitchat exchanging each others' information that night has gone a  long way in making us friends as we are today. He is a library keeda as many and even I call him. But he isn't a bookworm for sure. He is very intelligent and smart and does whatever he does perfectly.I kind of admire him for constantly working hard and giving up the free time which he might have had for doing timepass. But then,he believes that enjoyment after success is more sweet and I agree with him completely on that.A principled man,a jovial person, sometimes a irritating chap but one of the greatest friends to have and which I would cherish for ever.. The final word now.... here it goes.. Datyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
<p>Daaatye!! --- The big hearted kind saha footi friend. One of those guys you always address by their surname. Datye hasta hai aur hasaata hai- I never get tired of listening to his FC college kisse (especially the way he narrates it) First year was most amusing (2nd sem, to be exact :D). Datye seems to have an endless supply of cash, and with his endless generosity, he ends up lending it to others. His debtors probably owe him a small fortune by now! He is one of those people who NEVER while away their time, Datye is never on idle mode-always busy with something, be it acads, his cherished backstage, or simply helping someone out of a spot.He just seems to have a vast reserve of energy-never ceases to amaze us! Thank you, Datye for all those local,national, and international anecdotes. All the Best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Chaitya! I am probably the only person on campus who calls Datye by that name :D
I first met him in the mess, where he was giving away the "sweet" of the day. Chaitya is really really generous! 
Super clever, super hard working, super jolly is how I would describe him. We had a hell of a time during our PS at Thermax... be it sitting around watching movies or be it spinning around on the swivelling chairs :D Chaitya is also the one who completed most of the report while I was busy teasing Rachit. Thanks for everything, mate and good luck!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>Yo!...our usual greeting is a tip of the head and a two finger salute...damn, I am gonna miss these things with you...Datye is an extremely easy-going person, who is usually found hanging around the library doing the brainy stuff he does.. :P.....he is a very engrossing story-teller and has the most weird dreams!!!....i have never seen him angry or agitated and he never fails to bring a smile to a person's face :) ....he gives awesome treats :D...he's a good, unassuming person whom I am glad to have met and known...Arigato!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-repal">Neha Repal</a></p>
<p>Ae Datyeeeeeee .... a tt champion,a trained singer and a library keeda ....Datye is the man!!!!!
I admire him for sustained motivation and hard work.He always tries to learn new things and always wants to be the best at whatever he does.Even if he does not like a subject he will study it thoroughly and do well in it,such dedication is very rare.He is a kind hearted fellow who is always willing to help you.I wont write a long testimonial because then you will loose your precious study time reading it :P . Wishing you all the very best for present and future.(tera future to set hain waise) :)

<p>Chaitanya is kind  hearted ,hardworking ,funny and  very friendly guy. Datye is like the helpline numbers they give you -call at any time help is guaranteed ! . He is very helpful, whatever it may be acads , decisions or anything else he will always be there to help you. "Datye hai na kya tension hai?" you will hear this from people in his group often. He is very reliable and hard working guy.One of lesser known fact about Datye is he has been to ..dnt remember about 20 countries.He is a very funny guy to hang out with ..all we did at PS (:P) . 
He can get very fidgety if he is hungry (PS memories :D ). You were there always may it be FC , may it be BITS  , always be there for years to come . 
PS:  Funny enough Melange was not giving any search for "Chaitanya"  had to type "Datye"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prathamesh-dilip-gaikwad">Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad</a></p>

<p>Yo Dats! (Does anyone call you THAT? They better not! ? )
The swift jerk of his head upwards indicating a ‘ssup’ moment when I see him around is always a blissful moment for me ?
He is a very sweet person and one of the most hardworking beings I happen to  know . He is one of THE most helpful people I have found and one whose words ‘Don’t worry, marks milteel has always been a great encouraging moment. He is one of the most sincere persons anyone can ever come across. I have had great fun talking and chatting with him for ages, have missed my classes because of it :P Time just flies when one is engaging in a conversation with him. Taunting him is the funnest thing ever, but its always a pleasure to have him joke back! :D
He studies a lot and attempts whatever he does with cent percent scoring capability! Is confident and knows how to plan his studying so that he can complete every thing on his schedule. Always on the move from library to ... to library to... from library... to library... but always stops to have chat, and we can go on for ages on end :P
I am thankful to him for the aamba barfi that he got me from Chitale @ Pune! And I love Pune, especially this road called Jungle Maharaj Road *giggle* and the way all girls zoom on their scooties with a bandit-looking dupatta on their faces! Love it! :D
I enjoy having the Marathi, yet English chats with him. I get to learn new words, and he learns how to write them out in Marathi properly! Don’t you Dats? ?
Zhop it is and Zhop it shall be! Jop is like Flop! Eeeew vatta bagh na >.<
Gapp was never Gappe, but now it is thanks to him!
I have maroed the ZZZZorat tai dialogue to my sister multiple times, but I have never stolen its credits from you! ? I have always mentioned it was Dats’s creation and shall always be!
Thank you for being such a great friend that you are. I wish you all the very best for the future in every small thing to do and I your friendship is indeed treasured.
Before I sign off, let me just say.... MAAZ IT IS AND MAAZ IT SHALL BE! 
Cheers, =)
P.S: I would like to clarify one point on my testimonial by you: I DO NOT laugh out loud, really LOUD, Chaintanya!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/namrata-nadkarni">Namrata Nadkarni</a></p>
<p>"Are Datyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee " thats what you'll hear when passing  by AH5. Though now even we have incorporated it as our slogan while walking past Ah5 :D 
This keeda is always there in library irrespective of exams. Yeah also found in A mess NC from its start to closure. He is good to chat with. He is funny but more than that he knows everything going on in the campus - chalta firta wikipedia of campus. Oh and how can i forget ......he went home around 16 times in his 1st semester ....simply godlike _/\_.  He is an awesome person, inteligent, crazy and dirty at times ( dirty jokes ..when accompanied by tanmay) and also a hard working guy. Datye best luck for future :)

<p>Datye and I were in junior college together. No, we didn't know each other then, but now I wish we had, because he is one of the most amazing friends I have on campus! He's extremely sharp and brainy, sincere, and so enthusiastic about studying his courses, it makes me envious sometimes. Hours and hours pass by in the blink of an eye when you're hanging out with Datye in your midst, and these meetings always happen within a hundred yards of the library, because that's just his second home, which he sorely misses the day after an exam has ended. Monginis is his next favourite haunt, its the Datye-zone!  Coffee and chocolate donuts are his favourites, and he is rarely seen to be buying anything else.  All that said, He's very honest, modest and he's got his heart in the right place.  He's hard-working, diligent, persevering and has always excelled at academics, and called his first CDC semester "A Thriller", and in a good way, at that! I've enjoyed my conversations with him, and there are classic Datye-words and phrases that I shall miss hearing when we've gone off this campus. For example, “Maaz”, “Harlo”, “To hero” (referring to You-know-Who :P ) and the way he says “eeee “. Classes with him have been fun, and the Physics Project lab too, as project partners( TRULY unforgettable experience, that! )  although I will always be cross at him for not letting me use the drill-machine and monopolizing the solder gun. :)
But he's a true friend, one I shall keep in touch with and cherish all my life, and I'm sure he'll reach great heights at whatever he attempts. Ten years from now, he will have achieved everything that he today whines he will never get. :P Thank you for being there, so unassuming, never judging, always being a pleasure to talk to - I am glad to have a friend like you! All the very best for the future, and always stay in touch, for I always want to hear more tales of your “adventures abroad”, and dream sequences with famous people in it (that was a truly RIVETING one! and if it has a sequel, Datye, I want to be the first one to know!). 

PS: Please let Namrata know that its JUNGLEE Maharaj road, and I bet she’ll laugh harder!

<p>Datye... This guy is someone who has more energy than ne1 else I know. He is someone who will never put off doing something for tomorrow but will get to it right away. I always enjoy talking to him. One of the most sincere guys I know. He has been a very popular member of Backstage . He is also someone who has lived more in the library than in his room :P. Everytime you see him he has his sack on his back and is walking around the campus ... and yeah he never gets tired... He is always there to help you and is a kind and humble guy.  He's goin to be my neighbor next year so that should be fun. I am sure you'll have a great success in life Datyeeee. Thanks for being a great friend... All the best!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-sathe">Gaurav Sathe</a></p>
<p>datyeeeeeee!!!!! the most hardworking person i have ever seen..... i don't know from where he gets the motivation to go to the library every single day since the past 2 years!!!.... is a very soft spoken and helpful guy... always there to clear doubts and give his notes even before the exam :) ..... enjoyed a lot doing the SE project with you (though i didn't do much :P )... enjoyed going to mongi/nesci with you between database and se (some people missed quizzes because of us :P)... and always going 10 minutes late in SE class (and now people are trying to come after us...)... will definitely miss the moments spent with you for the past 1 year... wish you all the success in life!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>My first acquaintance in bits-goa,my oh so humble neighbour who always is there for answering all those silly doubts that i have even 5 mins before the exam(i'm really sorry man!),his room stands as a direct contradiction with respect to mine(sometimes I am seriously baffled as to how can someone's room be so clean ALL THE TIME!!!),very organised in his approach towards studies,one of the utmost hardworking people i've ever met,believe me,being his neighbour for the past three years,rarely have i seen him watching a movie or a tv series,highly studious and hardworking who constantly amazes me by his ability to outdo himself...Chaitanya,I wish you all the best for your future endeavours and please do stay in touch......Cheers!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-ramanan">Paritosh Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Chaitanya Datye needs no introduction. Everybody must have heard his name endless times during any audi event :) He is the phodu of IS in every sense. One of the very few people in campus who are actually interested in learning the subjects rather than just studying them for the sake of exams (except SE ? :P) He is always ready to help you in studies and won’t ever let you take tension. A dedicated and hardworking Backstage member, he puts all his heart and soul into everything he does. Feel privileged to have worked with you in SE project. Wish you all the best for your future life and do keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>This is one of the people I can describe at length and I could fill pages.. sorry books if I were given a chance to talk about him. First, a wonderful human being, no other adjective would work there. Second, extreme capacity to work without rest. Third, a crystal clear outlook towards life and fourth, a complete disregard for human physical limits. He will work so intensely that he won't realize till hours after he is done with it that he has missed breakfast, lunch and even dinner. When he is done with it, his body almost always gives up, literally collapses, but his mind ever so enthusiastic begins toying with something else. His vocabalury simply excludes the words "can't","impossible" and "give up". He will give up everything to stay true to his values and principles. I must take credit here to show him ways to kill time :P His is one of those few people who can bear almost everything one throw at him. This is one guy whom you start loving from the first moment you see him. I can remember nothing but exceptional moments with him. We share an inherent love for hygiene, disdain for people who tend to live unaware of it. We have spent many a days counting the number of people who come to classes without having a bath. Since he is almost always somewhere in the front while I am sleeping peacefully in the back, it is he who has to face the unbearable odour of a concoction of persipiration and deodourants. The time he is not working he keeps on talking about these horrible experiences especially targeting girls who put on 3-4 perfumes together and 5 of these sitting together generates an environment of a fish market as he describes it.  He will always correct you when you are on the wrong path but will also approve of all the crazy stuff I propose to do. It is practically impossible for a person like me to have a person such as this one here as a friend. But God sitting up there always has something to give to you. God has blessed me with more love through my brothers here than I can handle. I can't get myself to believe that within a few months I won't be seeing this guy all day long, have his reassuring presence always watching over me.His unending enthusiasm and love for life will continue to inspire me forever and ever.... Are.... Are... Daaaaaaaaatyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeee............ I love you.

<p>AREE DATYEEEEEEEEE.... 
I knew of Datye from our IIT coaching class, but we became friends here at BITS. Throughout these years he's helped me through so much. Be it jaundice, studies or any other stuff he's always been there for helping me out. He is a absolute clean freak. He cleans his room everyday, packs his laptop in the bag and keeps it inside the cupboard every night. He is very hardworking. I don't know where he gets the motivation for sitting those long hours studying continuously in the library. (I personally beleive that he was a more deserving candidate for the prestigeous nariel award for THE LIBRARY DUDE).I know of several occasions when he has skipped his meals just because he hasn't finished studying the subject. He's been to 20 odd countries and still doesn't care. You talk to him a bout taking a dive in the swimming pool, he'll tell you about his swim in the Atlantic ocean. He's very modest and humble. Its fun when he bitches about anyone. Everyone thinks he's just good at acads, but he's been a national TT player and swimming champ too. He's taken professional training in singing and loves singing. (it was fun singing Breathless with you, lets do it the next MM trip as well:P) A die hard F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan he is.
Will sure miss you the next 2 yrs here.(Yeah 2 here!!)
All the best for your life ahead! Keep rocking...

<p>Datye!! Known more for gudge's "melodious" (:P) rendition of his surname than for anything else he is one of the pro-est people of the batch. Having worked with him this whole semester for I have really come to admire his quick thinking and his problem solving skills. He is eccentric at times (like he'll never ever copy-paste ANYTHING! he always has to type out everything) and is one of the most dedicated and sincere people around. When he gets to work, he forgets about food, time everything! And give him any problem and he'll fix it in no time! He was also the lucky charm our assignment group-things would always start working when he ran our codes! :P Datye is one person who is ALWAYS smiling ! His basic philosophy of life, "tension not" (see I still remember Datye :P) is something many of us need to learn from. With your hard work and brains I am sure you'll go places. All the best for the future! Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreya-kedia">Shreya Kedia</a></p>
<p>Chaitanya is one of the few friends (I guess only) who I didn’t know in first sem (even though we belong to the same junior college). May be because he spent most of the semester time at home. He is a very determined, hardworking and generous person. He loves to give treats for no reason :P He had donated some hundreds of rupees to ice n spice and a bus conductor (not by choice though :P) He is also very (over)confident about a lot of things and ends up betting on them.  We have been together in MM and backstage. He tries to give his best to whatever he is doing, works really hard for everything. I remember him running in n out of control room and audi, at times for no reason. He just doesn’t wait for anyone to complete what they are saying. Chats with him can go on forever, he has loads of stories to tell, the Fergusson electronics class, chemistry lab incident, DG capacitor tale or his foreign visits. He tells them in a very interesting way. He is quite popular in campus, his name being heard aloud in audi or outside hostel (thanks to Pritesh)... A very sincere student. Studies all the subjects with equal dedication, irrespective of interest. Even tops a few of the subjects he hates. Respect for that /\. He is also a doubt-solver in library. Will clear your doubts even an hour before exams. You are sure to achieve great heights with the efforts that you put in. Wish you all the best for your future endeavours! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
