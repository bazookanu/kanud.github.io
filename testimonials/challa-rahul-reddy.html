<p>Rahul Reddy, the Ex-Vice President of Nirmaan Goa, is one of the most practical and logical people, I have had the opportunity to know in campus. He takes care of minute details, mostly overlooked by everyone else and this was a great boon to the Nirmaan team throughout the year. He is one of the very few people who has the guts  to give opinions about you, directly to you, however negative that may be. At the same time he chooses his words wisely so as to not hurt you. I can never thank him enough for his timely comments and feed backs during our tenure together in Nirmaan. He will be with you and support you, no matter what, if he believes that you are doing the right thing. He is always calm and composed, however difficult the situation may be. You can always trust his opinions to be unbiased and I'll always envy the way how he comes up with a pragmatic approach to all problems. 

Rahul,  I still wonder how you managed your acads, Nirmaan, pbm and TIME classes together and still found more time than me to spend with friends.  I will always cherish the moments that we spent together planning GBM's, excomm meetings, JOGW, deciding new excomm members, CDA  .. well basically everything that we did in Nirmaan and the treats and trips! Though we came to know each other at the end of second year, you have become a very good friend to me whom I'll always trust. I'm sure you'll find great success in life and have wonderful years ahead. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
<p>Challa!!!a close friend and one among few telugu people of AH-4 hostel.Whenever i looked at you i presumed you to be a Pandit!!!!!But to my disappointment it was never the case... :P  :P.
Calm and composed, yet to the point is his noticeable qualifications.For nirmaan as told by chitra it is the same.You were the person responsible for introspection of  ideas and implementations during endless late night discussions.Had it not been you, we would have simply made blunders(not mistakes).Great dedication, and impeccable logicality, and very outspoken makes you special from the rest.As a friend, a cool dude, funny and a person who is liked by all. Will miss all the birthday bumps and birthday celebrations!!!
All the best rahul!!!Have a great career ahead.keep smiling  :)  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>The last of the “Vice President” species of NIRMAAN....one of my close friends on the campus…He is a person with whom I talk any random (obsessed talks mostly) things, of course he might have got bored with them…but he always has the same smile on him.
He is the one silent guy who was behind every NIRMAAN activity. He is the EEE PRO person, the transport guy (arranges taxi) for whichever outing it myt be.
Silent, calm, fun loving, tooo friendly (even with teachers :P…especially SaJe ;) ), down to earth, dedicated to work, intelligent, extremely helpful, hardworking…it’s gng to be a never ending list!!!
Rahul and I used to plan different trips for our whole group to go out. Will surely miss the times we used to spend together with all our friends and make sure that our post-compre trip plan works out too 
Stay in touch ? and all the best for everything in your life (Just don’t think that this a kinda goodbye msg…our friendship is never gonna end)

<p>Des claimer : All the things mentioned below are true to my at most knowledge.!!
VP saab.!!! aka Psycho number1 .!!!
24x7 busy person
Sj's fav..!! and the vice  versa too.!! :P
Actually met him in 1st yr, when we were made to "interact" with 
him.!! :P
uske baad.!! rahul ka no ata pata.. untill i met him again in Nirmaan.!!
Then i wud have describes rahul as silent hardworking sincere calm blah blah blah..
But now after knowing him,apart from the obvious above and EEE pro  etc, i wud like to reveal few facts about him..
1)He was hit badly on his b'day and in the process somehow he hit his head and suffered brain damage
2) he suffers from MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER
3)so he is a PSYCHO and a SADDIST
This guy has 3 personalities : the normal self, the psycho which goes into two extremes, either he talks so much and displays his saddism to the peaks or he suddenly stops talking, becomes too reserved and stuff that u wont understand whats wrong..
so when with this guy.. be careful..!
but when he is his normal self, he is fun to be with..
A very practical person, and doesnt hesitate even a little to criticize (though sometimes, actually most of the times, his criticism is appreciated)..
Has a lot of mood swings.. (as mentioned above) due to the multiple personality disorder..
U can never predict how he would respond to anything.!! Sometimes even if u irritate and tease him a lot he just smiles and fires back at u and has fun along, and at other times even if u just say a word, he takes it tooooooooooo seriously, and you cant bear him at such times.. u feel like hitting him..!! Poor kids all of us who are his frnds that we had to bear with him :P :D am just (not) kidding :P :D
And yea coming back to THE FEW good things about him,He is a very friendly and caring person.. 
A very very regular student to all Sjs classes :D
and yea just got 1 more thing to add.. Viru sahasrabuddhi V2.0 :D ask him abt it for further details :P :D
He has a habit of giving(and taking also) tr8s.!! :D My first visit to HQ is bcoz of u rahul.!!! :D :D
And since he is a EEE pro, he used to help me with it.. (though it was b4, when he was nt bzz as he is these days ;) ) it always used to end up him giving tr8s for all the high marks he scored :D
Coming to Nirmaan.. every 1 has mentioned abt it already.. so il just put it brief.. His work is commendable.. The last VP of Nirmaan.. Whether it be his timely feedback or his contacts to get things done.. or his Photoshop skills, where he just makes you any poster in a small time, or his observation & analytical skills and practical thinking ,he was always a support to Nirmaan and the work we did.. Very Professional when it comes to work.! and it was gud 
as he used to be the1 who used to put back the importance and seriousness of the work wheneva i used to take lyt..!
and yea.. his creativity \m/\m/.. rahul.. TV0 will always be remembered.!! :D :D
well this is IN SHORT (:P) about this psycho guy.!!
oh yea how could i forget.. he is PJ..!! (Pilla Jamindar) The title itself explains.. i need not elaborate on this i guess ;)
i had some memorable moments with you(all your three personalities :P) be it the Nirmaan work, or walks after mess, our fights, and time spent in lib,the melody fights. loads of pics we took, games in ur iPod, Our ADHAAR research :P, compre movie sessions :D, bdays( i can never frget them :| and i always hate u fr the cake put on me), ACM and the dog chase during ACM, our trips.. and yea arz visit..I remember how much i hit u that day... n poor guy dint say a word.!! though its been compensated after that :|,ur Psychoism will also be remembered, the post ACM discussions  :P ;) and many other moments.. I have soo many things to mention, but i guess ill stop here..i had a fun time with u.. and yea it is not goodbye yet coz u have to be in contact atleast for me to hit you.!! :D :D I sure will NOT miss u.. :P kidding :D
take care.. keep smiling. and yea go to a doc soon..!! ;) :P
Cheers..! all the best.!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kavya-gayatri">Kavya Gayatri</a></p>
<p>Rahul bhaaaai, PiJa(Pilla Jamindar :D), Batting BABA........my partner in Dobbing ppl ! :D Starting 4m 2nd year, its been a heck of ride with u ! Well, wat to say about ur personality, u have got all the praises and stuff in the above testimonials, so, u know me.....lazy to type the same stuff again. :D 
But one thing for sure, u r my nemesis when it comes to planning and looking out for the final outcome, always planed and daammmnn tactive ! U just know how to get things done(an expert in putting ppl in ur pocket :D)so a person with loot of contacts, beautifully manage stuff and your sense of practicality. But sometimes shrewd enuf to make very convincing logics in ur favour and make ppl feel like bakra wen the think back after a while[this a from personal exp, just a couple of times tough >.<]. For any1 who is reading this testimonial, beware, just dont care to listen when he says he screwed up in exams. Remember our dilouge ? "anthe rahul anthe, Munchesau" :D. A salute to ur managing ability, I totally need to know how u do that ! Wen something has to be done, he just does it. For instance he became Nirmaan VP in a very short span after joining. 
All the times we spent together, every day evening to ice n spice, listening to all my soda theories, soda logics, dobbing ppl, first it was Teja, then it was UKG kid, kathri who came to his ultimate rescue, OMFG ! the way we used to toy around with her and setty pilla also, and the list goes oon. But K3 has been an epic bakra of our combo. All the theories and stories we made on Teja, we dint put the comic per to action tough, but will atleassst make one episode b4 will leave the campus ! the name ISMAIL bhai, and the fun in using all the movie dialogues and situations at the right time and right moment, Dominoes pizzas we ordered together and ate in ur room. The starting of our treat pact and just what not ! U started calling me batting baba and suddenly the name got coined to u :D A fact though, into lot of texting these days ! I can go oon and oon with the things we have done together ! Btw, maintain ur political ambitions, I will be having a wonderful background power then ! :D 
As always, no senti stuff bro.......just keep rocking. :)
