<h1 class="page-title">Charith Kandala</h1><p>Not "one of the" but "THE" best photographer I have ever met till now. Really enthusiastic about his stuff and on the whole, a really talented guy with real passion.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>First time I met him was in our MT labs(I knew him earlier, but not his name). Thanks to him, we have some unerasable MT II memories.A very energetic personality, you can recognise him from a mile away.
Truly talented, he is a genius with the camera (now who doesnt know that?) After all, the best things come in small packages!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>

<p>Charith Kandala is a great person at heart with a highly positive aura around him. He is perhaps the most diligent and most talented photographer I have ever seen. One cannot just skip by the photos taken by him. The pictures he takes are so live that they start talking to the viewer. He is a simple and straightforward person and that is the best thing about him. When you are with him, you don't have to act like someone else, but be yourself. I wish him a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Charith Kandala is one of the finest photographers in our campus. Its not something he achieved overnight, but through months of hard-work, accepting criticism, learning and improving- which I have seen with my own eyes. He is one of the few friends who I can discuss about photographer for hours at a time; the technical and aesthetic aspects as well as post production techniques. Working with him during zephyr 2010 was great. I remember when both of us started project 365, I couldn’t go beyond 8 days, while he continued and improved exponentially during that time. He also inspired me to write the blog I currently own. Though our friendship has had it ups and downs, I will certainly cherish the good memories we shared. And thanks for all the profile pics :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Charith is not only another epitome of photography, but also an altruist who can do anything to get a smile on his friends’ faces. He is a perfect blend of mood , attitude ,passion and emotions all in such a perfect proportion that they make ‘The Charith’. Not all of us can possess such passion and chase our dreams . Hats off to you. May you have a very bright future and Stay in touch :) . All the best !! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>

<p>Charith Kandala aka chatri. The only person who has a set future. His actions speaks louder than his words. He dosen't care what people think about him. He does what he does best. The best photographer i have ever met. He's really passionate about basketball, a great guy and a good friend. I wish him all the best for the future and i hope he may become the best photographer. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>First thing that comes into my mind, when i think of Charith is photography. THE BEST photographer i have ever met. He plays basketball and table tennis very well. Always encouraged me for playing basketball. He is an exemplary person for passion, because of his passion for photography. One day he will surely become one of the best photographers in the world. Eagerly waiting for that day, ...All the best!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankeerth">Sankeerth</a></p>

<p>Our dear Chhatri (he told everyone to call him that in 1st year itself) is one heck of a guy. He is a photography and basketball geek and that has not changed in the past 3 years. Also, teasing him is loads of fun (thanks to his reaction) :P You better invite me to your first exhibition as a pro, Chhatri, I am looking forward to it.

<p>Chatri Bhai.... One of my mentors when it comes to photography. The little kid with an eye which penetrates through the obvious and unveils the unseen beauty. One of the few people i know who are know for the work they have done. Will miss you after college little friend and as i have already said you are the "Dude with a golden cam." All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>All you need to say when it comes to this guy is .. He is THE best photographer I've ever seen in my life... his dedication and passion for his art is unparalleled.. And if anyone wants to learn socialising with people plz go to this person.. he's the god of this area...  His curiosity and enthusiasm about anything is worth admiring... He's probably the only one person i know in this campus whose future is all set.. he knows his strengths and plays according to them.. apart from this he's a good basketball and pool player... and a real "d00d" .... All the best for future.. enjoy :)

<p>Workshop partner, FFO partner, SCEO partner……never got rid of him :P. I remember the first time I saw his name in the workshop group list, I couldn’t spot this small chap :P. But I must admit he is truly a small wonder. A brilliant photographer (no need to mention this ;)) and a guy who is determined to pursue the career he is passionate about instead of following the suit. It takes a lot of courage to do that and I really respect you for that. Lab sessions were fun with me, Sneha and Megha pulling your leg all the time. Will miss those days. All the best for future and I hope that you achieve all you want in life :). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
