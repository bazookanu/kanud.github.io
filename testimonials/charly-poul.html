title: Charly Poul

<h1 class="page-title">Charly Poul</h1><p>One of the funniest guys in our batch without question. He never fails in putting a smile on your face. Anyone who has seen his mime performances will agree with me. From Gabbar Singh to SuperNoob he gave us some of the best performances yet. His actual self is more or less like the characters he portrays :P . Other than all this hes a pro football n  basketball player. My college life wouldn't have been the same without him and his stories especially the epic dammam beach. Helping ,cheerful,modest and not so hard working. Always keep in touch. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>

<p>My life in bits has been awesome.Far into the future, i will have a lot of insane amazing memories about my bits life.Neither of the above statements would have been true if Charly was not there.From getting ragged together on the first day, to having fought with EEE labs and exams in the last semester, the journey was really great.
Be it any activity, Charly was there with me, basketball, guitar, jogging, long night-outs at the central lawns talking about random shit,  :P :D, etc.
A great personality, he never runs out of jokes or expressions(:D). He is a very talented actor and the mime club is grateful to him for many insane perfomances. The Gabbar Singh and the School Boy and the Shiela Ki Jawani!! Mime meetings without Charly is like chicken curry without chicken(:P), like a bed without mattress and like cold bournvita without bournvita :) :D. 
When this third year comes to an end, and the awful realization that we have PS in different semesters dawn, i hope to spend more time with him in the future, either in work or elsewhere...coz life will NEVER EVER be the same without him. Dont ever change :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/seby-jacob">Seby Jacob</a></p>
<p>Charly paul..I have so much to say abt this guy..well i remember it was the first day when i came to d campus and before i met him, my dad met him first..He said me that just now a boy with his father came in to our opposite room and he is frm kerela..I was very eager to see who was it, but i went smewhere because of smework.This guy was also eager to know me,and i guess it was during while we r walking to audi for director's speech, suddenly a guy came running towards me and saying me,hiee im charly ..Then i thought who is this guy, my dad said me dat he is this guy who came in frnt of ur room..It then started from dat day..well we became gud frns and i started to learn malayalam words from him nd his malayali bunch of frns, and evrytime when i see him i used to start with malayalam words :P When i first met him, i thought this guy was very innocent, but later realised that he is a great actor :P Charly is a great mime artist and very few know him as  a very gud dancer..He has very different style of studying, but whatever he do  he'll do just bfre 6-7 hrs of the exam and scores decent marks.. He has very gud grasping power and i notice him as a great human being, down to earth, very friendly and multitalented person.He is actually the guy who deserves the award "Mr.Fantastic". With his talent he'll definitely reach great heights and may be in the future i can see him as a star in mallu film industry :P eda i miss u next sem in the campus...i pray to god to grant ur wishes and loads of happines in ur life..and do stay in touch whereever we might be after this sem :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raj-shekar">Raj shekar</a></p>
<p>dis guy is above all words.in first lik u wil find him to be a normal guy who is quiet(dats wat i felt wen i met him first :P), but from d second day ur opinion will be shatterd 2 pieces. This guy is like a volcano..:P.. not in any othr way but so much energy and enthusiasm, probably one of the brightest mind. one commendable thing about him is his attitude towards life. He takes evrythng sportively and aims high. when you think of this guy and the time you spend with him you get millions of incidents rushing through your mind. He is actually the 'Darling' of our gang. He never fails to impress you with his expressions or words.I  will never forget the awesome incidents like 'Being ragged, Ragging jnrs, DJ nite prasaad, Election campaign..:D, Vamsi club, Indi-commandos, getting caught by police in 3 differnt states and a unnion territory..:D, water tank ni8 outs,etc and the list is endless. He is a total package of awesomeness( d complete myaan..) in all aspects. His nature to excel in( not studies..:P)  guitar, drums(credits to sundar), keyboard, basketball, footsal is amazing.  He   is the person you can count  for any bull shit and insane ideas you give. I can say with full pride that I have shared stage with the best actor Bits goa has ever seen. He need not give any expression to make u laugh. Just his looks are enough. He make u feel that acting is an easy piece of cake. His contribution to Mime club doesnt end there. All the awesome music contributions are from this head which he does in ease. I m really gonna miss u next sem but i know u wil be back with all your in-saneness reloaded. No formality of wishing for your future  because i know we will be in touch.. One piece of advice "Dont even change a bit....".<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>i challenge ppl for a bet of 1000 Rs if they can control their laughter for atleast 5 mins wen he is around u......hehehe....dont go for it cz u r nt gonna win for sure.  He is such a whimsical and a witty  guy that u will find it hard to forget his jokes .We have been together for 3 years ....and u can say i have never trusted anyone like him before.In short u can say that his life is an open book.......he shows no hesitation in discussing anythng wid us.somtimes he is worse than a 5 yr old kid...which had made me so furious a lot of times...but then evrythng jus melts away wen u see his innocent baby like smile showing his 32 teeth(i guess) wid lots of gaps .Truly i ve nvr come across such a humble person like him b4.A real  multi talented guy...i wud say.....keyboardist.....guitarist.....plays basketball,football.....an awesome actor and comedian.......and the list goes on and on......and one of my favourite actors of all time.You would be truly amazed by the vivid ideas that come into this guys mind(out of wich 90 perc wud b abt shit nd farts)......and is so playfull most of da times.Its so hard to pick one memory among the flurry of beautifull memories that i share wid this moron .Eventhough i admire him so much ,i never miss achance to pull his leg or tease him....that sort of gives me  gr8 pleasure...lol.i bet dat he is one of a kind in this world and u r not gonna meet anyone like him ever in ur life again......so dont waste any chance that u get to make fun of dis guy.. :D....and luckily i got one more sem to spend wid him...and i wish him all da best in his life...rock on... :)

<p>I am honoured to have known THE CHARLY POUL during my life at BITS. He is one of the awesomest guys I have ever met, you can never control you laughter whenevr he is with you, his very expressions can send you into splits. I cant help but wonder how anyone could come up with such expressions... his a god onstage when he performs MIME!! Will always remember his performances especially...the as the midget, Gabbar Singh and ofcourse Super Noob!!! You are a phenomenal ACtor, with an excellent comic timing...
Personaly..I guess you are a very warm person...we end up pulling each others legs..and fighting whenevr we meet..all the times i said that you are Gay..( I still think you are.. :P... just kidding).....but I know deep side, that you are just a paavam boy..very friendly...very genuine...someone who would do anything for his friends....I wish to have known more about you!! All the best Charly!!! Have a great life ahead!!!
And yeah..you are \m/ <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/fatima-dilruba">Fatima Dilruba</a></p>
<p>Charly.. the kampleet mann !!! When i first met him at CP, i thought he was a tough nd stubborn kinda guy.His thick frameless glasses nd the serious looks on his face(yeah she is right mann.. :D)  gave me dat impression.But then i heard ppl (mostly seniors) talkin abt him... "Charly is so \m/ nd hilarious .... ." His song"ente peru charly..ente veedu  kalady.. "  along with his funny dance moves just shattered dat tough impression of his. I couldnt control my laughter !!!.. :D :D Frm there ther''s no stopping him. he gave me numerous xperiences like watching horror muvies at nite,workshop incident(im really srry :P :D),the videos we made together(GG fied nd Kannadi.. :D ),first outing in bike,outings in kochi,train journeys,playin basketball,long late nite discussions on ghost stories in bay road..... nd so on.  The best actor i hav ever seen !! Whenever i see him on stage i  think "yy the hell is he studyin engg?  He should work in muvies !! ".He doesnt practice  too hard for acting those scenes but still he makes the audience jump off their seats with laughter.i always wondered... hw he is doin it. dats yy without any doubt we can call him.... a born actor.His contribution to mime club is nt limited to acting.He is the one responsible for all the awesome background scores which u enjoyed in the past 4-5 mimes.Other dan acting.. he is excels in playin keyboard,guitar nd nwadays drums !! he is also gud at basketball nd futsal. Im soo gonna miss this guy next sem. ill try my best to keep in touch wid u ..charly.. coz ur a rare kind. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-">Rahul </a></p>

<p>Many know this guy as the pro mimer who can do any role with ease, but as a person he is much much more interesting than you would ever have thought. He epitomises the phrase 'taking lite' when it comes to acads or anything which is not fun.The range of facial expressions he can produce would make even rowan atkinson proud. Charly always likes to try new things out, whether it be playing a new sport or learning a new musical instrument, and he gets pretty good at many of them too. Being a totally fun loving man, he can lighten the mood of our gang in any situation. But the most epic moments I'll always remember him for have not been in campus, but at a place nearby known as Bogmalo. This guy can get high real cheap and once he is you are in for the treat of your life :P. The time during PS1 in chennai was also so much fun because of this guy's presence, with our constant jokes about the company engineers and his never ending hate chants about the city and the people. He has a lot of passion for riding bikes, playing guitar and drums and watches a hell lot of sitcoms. He also has a rather quirky interest in natural gas production :P. Above all this, he is a really dependable and trustworthy friend to have and my 3 years in campus would never have been the same without his presence. Hope something great awaits you in the future and hope you win a lottery soon and pay off those humongous debts :P. All the best and always keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>Charly Poul is ONE AMAZING GUY. He’s got a unique personality. From his acting to the way he talks to the way he walks around like a boss to the jokes he cracks to the way he thinks, just amazing. I have always been a fan! I am truly lucky to meet him. He may be low on self-confidence but that’s only because he’s modest. He’s always trying to find the funny side of things. You’ll find this guy cracking jokes and having fun at funerals. Extremely talented, can dance sing act play guitar, piano and of course mime! I consider him as the god of mime. Will never forget the act he put up for his mime club induction (toilet without water). He’s been such an amazing friend to me. I don’t care who won the Mr Fantastic award, He deserves it. Had some great times together. When i first met you in the ragging session, the midnight strolls, the outings, the trekking, PS in that shit hole Chennai, eating kaka biryani’s, getting you drunk, the rapes and hangouts in sikhil’s room, the videos, the pranks, the kollam jokes, the betty jokes,the fart jokes, thunder pants, paintball, choring sundar together, damam beach, getting raped in AAOC courses even though mani taught us etc. etc. Has been an amazing 3 years! Man going to miss you like hell.Glad we have one more semester together. Keep in touch after that!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>ENTERTAINMENT GUARANTEED   
It is simply not possible to get bored when he’s around. From Damam Beach to Aluva Railway Station, wherever he goes incidents follow him. He has a wide range of expressions and the simplest of his antics, is enough to start a laughing spree. He always has an anecdote to share and a dance step for every occasion. He has a unique style in everything he does and has a taste of his own. No matter how well you know him, Charly always manages to exceed your expectations. And once he is drunk, there is no limit. He is also the perfect guy for all kind of pranks – both as the victim or to pull a prank on someone else.
Charly is an extremely talented and motivated person. He gets interested in a large variety of things, he keeps pursuing them and he excels in them. He is good in basketball, keyboard, guitar, drums, football… To say he is good in Mime would be an understatement. Mime was made for him.
Until you get to know him, he is a very shy person. After that his energy and excitement will astonish you. And as people mentioned earlier, he is Mr.Fantastic.
 Above all, he is very humble and sincere, and a good friend. I’ll miss him badly next sem. Hoping to spend more time together…
Wishing you the best in life<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashin-george">Ashin George</a></p>
