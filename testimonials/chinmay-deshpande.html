title: Chinmay Deshpande

<h1 class="page-title">Chinmay Deshpande</h1><p>A true carefree guy in the campus. Always chilled and confident, i have never seen him in tension. Consistent in academics, he always keeps himself well informed. Difficult to win a debate against him. Has an awesome smile. With all the things going on in his mind (difficult to figure out :P ), i think he is THE genius of our campus, our very own Einstein. Always fun to have him around in our group, he is always the center of attention most of the time. A true bindaas guy. Hope you can reach great heights. Best of Luck Chiinnnuuu !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Quarantino !!! Heavy voice , weird smile and sharp brains . Remember the day man when we were chatting almost the whole night and listening to Iron Maiden , great that was . :) 

"dude" , "Fuck it " , "This sucks" , "Chuck it " , you should patent all these phrases . I heard a lot of these when we were together for MT1 Physics . He can be weird , you can spot him moonwalking in the corridor :P This is a kind of a guy who repeats a course only because he got a C :| . 

Anyway man , you have been a great neighbour , considering my habit of playing loud music . :D 

Wish you all the best in life .

<p>its not every semester i end up with awesome lab partners(or bench-mates, if you will). and those with a sense of humor, rarer still.  i read a handful of your blogs. you have a way with your words, smooth yet curt. not many can connect like you do, you have a gift.  smart, intelligent and a very modest guy. all the best for your future. :)

PS: i think you and kaustub should patent your all-in-one-output circuits. piece of work, dat.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>
<p>For the record I NEVER thought chinmay as an idiot. In fact I always imagined him as the intelligent guy who sits in the corner and makes fun of people inside his head.  Whatever little bit I gotta know him, I can easily conclude that when you talk to him you know you are talking to a smart guy. Initially he might seem weird but once he starts talking it's actually fun. Working with him for DoJMA blog was a HUGE help and a fun chatting session. Also, one of the reason that i got to know him better. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Being with Chinmay these three years has been one one big squabble. Since the very first day we hit it off. Trying the to better the other was the only fuel we had especially when it came to acads. Being the lethal prankster in our group, he made life hell for me - locking my door from the outside, stealing my stuff; chucking water through the ventilator at my dad being the most memorable one. However, the real biggies in his sadistic artillery are his witty comments which he metes out to people in copious measures.  His artful one-liners can end a long argument resulting in a deflated ego of the target. Also known as kanu, this guy also sported a mohawk back in his first year and also does the moonwalk and handwalk in his own uniquely nerdy retarded way... Asking people how much time it takes to complete chapters a day before tests and trivialising the efforts taken by people to actually complete them has always been chinmay's trademark. Really dont know how this guy manages to get marks with the kind of attitude he's got. In the recent times we have learnt to collaborate to invade Jayant's room time and again, park our asses cozily on his bed and begin taking Lufa boy's case. This guy is one unique museum specimen. He will go a long way...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>Pandu! Where do i start? I've known this nut since school and even though we never really got talking back in school, he was always known to be a really brainy guy. Fast forward 4 years and Pandu is my neighbor in college! Chinmay is an awesome, awesome guy. Perpetually poker faced and bored with life but that little head of his still has some great things going on up there. Its been a real pleasure living next to him and i'm going to miss chinmay walking by my door mouthing "ssup?" and the random shout of "Vaaaaas! Did you know ....?" or Dude, this happened and that happened. Its been one hell of a ride pandu and i hope this is just the beginning. Here's to a long, long friendship! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Chinmay aka Kanu aka Quari. A really great guy, who I guarantee, you'll enjoy talking to. A personality, that isn't loud and noisy, yet enchanting. His knowledge on all sorts of topics is vast, and his passion for writing and blogging - unparalleled among all who I've met.  I doubt if I can really put it into words - the kind of person he is, and will be (hopefully). I enjoyed his company and cherish the times we spent together arguing over the weirdest topics (often just for the sake of argument).  A blend of childish insecurity & curiosity, as well as the wisdom and open-minded rationalism - that comes only with maturity of one's mind. That's what comes to my mind, when I think of Chinmay - and, perhaps that's why I gravitated towards him and we became friends as soon as we met.

“Truly great friends are hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget.”

The future lies before us, like paths of pure white snow. Be careful how you tread and forge ahead along your own path. May our paths cross some day, in a happier time, so that we may rekindle our friendship.  [Perhaps, it'll be at a book-signing session by bestselling author Kanu.  ;-) ]

Good luck and Farewell Chinmay...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-srivastava">Arpit Srivastava</a></p>
