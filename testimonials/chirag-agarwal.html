<p>Chintu aka Pinky Phlud/Hapac Loyd , is a kid at heart-seriously this guy just doesn't want to grow up and that's what makes him such a cool friend to have.An ardent lover of Pink Floyd(and this obsession of his sometimes irritates the shit out of me X-( ,multi talented and always full of energy.This guy literally knows 99.99 % people in the campus thanks to his proness in fifa and aoe,awesome dance skills,DEPP coordinator for SPREE,involvement in Aero club,Kala and god knows what.But that's not it.This guy is pro in coding ,animation and acads.He is the perfect all rounder.His inexplicable obsession with Pink Floyd,routine rifts with him ,sharing music with each other and all those awesome moments that we spent together I just have to say _/\_<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>A great guy with great hair :P but Chirag has proved time and again that he is more than that with his diverse span of talents. What is amazing is despite all of these innate qualities he manages to stay rooted and act pretty cool. Sometimes he can be a little crude but hey no one is perfect :P I know for a fact that he is going to be rockstar wherever he goes. Enjoy and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>You are a true all-rounder....and an immensely talented person. Be it music, dance, gaming, etc., you always give your 100% in everything you do. You have excelled in acads and have done an equally good job as the Spree DEPP Coordinator. Your imitation skills always amuse me and you are always fun to be with. I will always remember the awesome time we had together while practicing for MM culturals. The one thing that I like about you the most (perhaps because I lack it :P) is your desire to keep learning new things, be it a software or a musical instrument. It is actually very difficult for a person not to idolize you given that you have so many qualities yet you are so friendly and down-to-earth. I am sure you will achieve loads of success in your life and I wish you all the best for the same. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>

<p>He's smart, funny, a great friend I'm glad to have and always fun to talk to. He's one of the members of my inseparable PS 1 group - a wonderful set of people that I'm lucky to have had the pleasure to meet and work with. Oh, and laugh with, for no reason at all, during (yes, "during") group discussions and highly technical presentations! :P The simple fun we all had that summer and in the year that followed will always be remembered as some of the best memories of my college life. It's great to know you, Chirag, and always stay in touch - the Canopus PS group will always stay intact, no matter where our separate ways lead us! Wish you all the best for your future.

<p>I know this guy since m 1st year and he is a true all-rounder. He is a great company. We attended M.sc maths together and as mentioned already he gives his best to everything, be it dance, music or DEPP , I will miss the times we had .. All the very best - :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>He is my darling.....mother of our two kittens :P (Sorry I have to be the father :D)

1st time I saw him, was when he came to my room to find the carpenter, after that I don't remember how we became friends. He is a friend which everyone wishes to have.....too caring. Very hard working, all rounder.....li8 i can't praise him more!! When we became friends, he was a sidha sada vegetarian guy, but since then kaafi pragati ki hai usne......n all i love about him is his highness :P and also his dance!! Have lots of cherishable memories together. He is a true devotee of Pink Floyd. The time spent with you and others on the water tank was priceless. Friend for life time.......you will be missed very much!!

<p>Street-smart, prankster, entertainer, the-one-who-knows-everyone, guitarist, PinkFloydFan, god-gamer and a phodu 9p thats Chirag, the youngest of my kids. I still distinctly remember meeting him for the first time in my corridor and I was quite amazed at how he was talking to everyone as if he had known them forever and his characteristic Mumbaikar way of talking with all of his slang, which he brought here through 400km of Western Ghats, was equally new for me. The journey since has been full of surprises and fun. Be it the recent water tank trek at 3 in the night, the corridor chudaap, in-numerous trips to your fav Kashi Dairy(:P), or the independence day parades we took out in the first year(for which i had got caught also) it was all so full of fun. One does get surprised at how quickly he changes gears when the exams arrive, or for that matter any new occasion/festival/event, and becomes a different person altogether to produce results which none of the other simpler beings are even able to dream. His dedication towards whatever he does is of the highest level. He is one hell of an all rounder and one can safely assume that he is capable of doing anything, one can think of, under the sun.  This kid, I am tellin' ya, is going to win the world and make us all proud of having been in his company at sometime in the history. Wait for it everyone, and you won't be surprised or disappointed. 
Continue to be the kid you are, son, and keep smiling! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>
<p>Chirag is my youngest son but he is more mature than anyone else in our group. He was the first one i met on the campus, I helped him in arranging his documents :), I don't know if he remembers. On the first day when i was just trying to fit in, I found him talking to everyone as if he knew them from a very long time. As time passed I learned a lot of good qualities from him one of them being honesty. He is the most honest guy i have ever met and I really admire his work ethics, he takes his work as his religion whether it be acads or abhigyaan or depp and the best thing is that he is always down to earth. Another thing which I learnt from him was that you don't have to wait to do something big for the society you can start with the very small things and small things does matter. It is useless to say that you are an all rounder everybody knows that. I don't know kaunse baba ki kaunsi goli he eats but I get really amazed at times to see the amount of passion and enthusiasm he has to learn new things. I believe that with your honesty and work ethics you have a long way to go and i am sure we will always be friends no matter happens. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-pathak">HARSHIT PATHAK</a></p>

<p>CHIRAG! Where do I even start?? This guy is one of the most different people I have ever known. Multi-talented in a plethora of categories, he can do it all :) He can sing, he can dance, he can play the guitar (yes! mine is still in the dust - but one day it shall not! :P), he can run, he can play badminton, he can crack jokes, he can mimic and what not! After all this he still is a very down-to-earth and a mature being. I got to know him well when we played mixed doubles at SPREE for two years! We improved in the next year, didn't we? :P
I had the most epic fun with him during our TRW presentation. I shall never keep a straight face after seeing a Mona Lisa image! Never! :D :P :) 
He has a fine taste in music and yes, you too made me listen to songs which I never would have dreamed of - I mean 26 minutes songs which have 9 parts!! NO THANKS! But I did listen to them, thanks to you, and I loved it :)
Chirag is one of the most caring and humble people I have known on this planet. I have had some great moments with him which I shall cherish for years to come. We have great fun chatting, and land up talking on almost everything that there is to talk about! I have never had a boring or dull moment with him! I enjoy pulling his leg and he reciprocates very well :P
You have been a great friend Chirag and are one of the most wonderful people I have known! And I know you shall go on to do sky-limit things in life! Stay the same and don’t you ever change!!
I hate SLICES of cheese, NOT AMALGAMATED!! :D :D :P

Cheers, _\/_

<p>Chirag.. When I say his name, around 100 paladins start running in front of my eyes. His paladins are like dark riders in LOTR who never die."They will never stop hunting you." A true LOTR fan. I Always love to discuss LOTR with him and noijja. He is also a fan of Sunday morning breakfast. He would do anything to have that. Rest all has been said already about his proness in every field whether it is dancing, playing guitar, studying, badminton etc. the list is too long. 
And I am honored that I got the opportunity to dance with chirag the Hunsraj which was choreographed by chirag the King Arthur.:P
All the best. We will play in 4-2 again. But to play with you I will have to practice a lot.your 
paladins are not letting me sleep.....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
