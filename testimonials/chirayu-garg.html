<h1 class="page-title">Chirayu Garg</h1><p>Chirayu Garg is a person you wouldn't find doing trash talk, he speaks less, but whatever he speaks is to the point and accurate. Apne pados k gaon ka jaat hai aur gaon ja k mehnat karne ka boht shauk hai. He may seem rude at times, but he is a very good friend and the most sensible person in Biological Sciences Group. Intelligent, sharp and smart. A person of his calibre is sure to find success in all of his future endeavors. All the best buddy!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>
<p>I really don't remember where I first met him but I wherever it be, I consider myself lucky! To be very frank he's different from others in the way he sees things. One of his best quality I have observe is - "He always go for kill" no matter what the situation is, a really an outgoing and street smart guy. Not to mention, he's a rock from outside but soft from within. I think being his partner during Nettech and the "fight", has helped me to get to know more of him, though I still regret the latter. Apart from all these, he's honest, hard-working, annoying sometimes ;) but a very good friend. I will always remember the good and bad times we have together as friends, and wish you all the very best for a great and wealthy future ahead :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>“Gaon(muzaffarnagar)  jaunga mehnat karunga apni zaryratein puri karunga” chirayu ki pet line hai. Get’s irritated very quickly if you accuse him of wrong doing. Punctual, saari classes attend karta hai. Pare tutane k baad bhi class gaya. His only motto is to go to classes. He says room pe baith kar kya karunga. Jokes apart, he’s a good person at heart. Talks very less. Does his work sincerely. Time spent together will always be memorable. He has a very successful future ahead(Gaon mein internet cafe :P). All the best for the future!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>“Gaon jaoonga, mehnat karoonga……”  I have heard these line more than 10k times in past 1 years.one of my close friends , he is extremely hard working, sincere ( 100% attendance ka sapna toot gaya bechare ka ;)  ), someone who is always ready to help you ( but pehle u have to hear some thrash : P ) and  always speaks the truth ( like it or not : | )
The best part is how easily he gets irritated and how much I like to irritate him (  LOL ,blackmailing him for reports \m/ , teasing him ,  mera toh ho gaya tum apna dekh lo , roflmao!!!!, calling him in 7 in the morning and asking if there is class @ 8 or not {although u know it.} ). Coming to acads , he is extremely phodu ( apart from girls, bio mein sabse zyada yahi padhta hai : D ).Intreseted in techie stuff and all (nettech, blah blah blah , mere ko toh bournville se matlab tha : D : D) .
I wish him luck and all the very best for his future and wish him a successful future ahead .(woh apni “company” yaad hai naa!!)

<p>"Gaon waalo, life mein kise problem nhi", "Gaon jaunga mehnat karunga apni jarooratein poori karunga" and "Hum jatt log hai" are the few lines that put a big smile on my face whenver I hear from him. He is a very calm, intelligent and hardworking person. He never misses the classes and is very punctual. I wont forget the trips we had especially the biotrips. The moments we had in mess discussin the "fatty and sirji attitude during labs" were amazing. Thanks for being such a friend and wish you all the best for your future.

<p>chirayu garg... as i would like to describe him, is.... a nice and a very straight forward person at heart... but a bit strict and annoying on the outside... very hard orking and dedicated to his work... which makes him very much different to those who just have interest and put in no effort to prove themselves.... though he does his best to taunt me and irritate me... i really feel that we are good friends... and do hope we remain the same in future.... huge potential as a coder and hope he achieves something big in his future endeavors..(saale GSOC KE LIYE APPLY AKR DETA... :P) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankit-jain">Ankit Jain</a></p>
