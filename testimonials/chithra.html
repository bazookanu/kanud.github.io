<h1 class="page-title">Chithra</h1><p>One of the nicest people i know on the campus...it has been great to know you..and wish you all the best for all your endeavors ahead...i am sure its gonna be a great life for you..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-deshpande">Aditya Deshpande</a></p>
<p>She's sincere, extremely hard working, and possesses an unparalleled enthusiasm for all that she believes in, be it academics or working for a cause. She's been a great friend and colleague, always ready to help out anyone in need, and is one of the sweetest people of my aquaintance. An unforgettable part of third year has been our long discussions about the seemingly impossible problems that would resolve themselves when we put our heads together; it was this that made tough subjects so much more bearable. She's excelled at them all, along with managing Nirmaan with all her heart and soul. She's lively, fun, and the most model student you could possibly find, and her humility and kindness makes her even more unique. Salute to you, 001, and know that you'll be sorely missed, so stay in touch, and may all the good luck go with you! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>My first day at college and I met her; very tall and amazingly graceful, and long plaited hair. The stability and peacefulness from which all her actions arise is what I like the most. Sleeping and waking up early has been her routine even through BITSian life, although third year changed that a bit :P. Its wonderful to see her handling nirmaan work, CDC year ( and acing it), projects, dance and so many things extremely dexterously. You have been an inspiration and years ahead when I look back at college life you will be one of the people I’ll remember most. Love :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/surbhi-khetrapal">Surbhi Khetrapal</a></p>

So hardworking.. I miss you sometimes when I want do something technical at home and I remember quark of second year… also ieee :) it was soo good.. I haven’t had so much fun in any technical activities since then.. you are the person to look up to when I find myself very stressed out.. and then see that this girl here has managed so well her nirmaan presidentship… her cdcs.. her project work.. you were so regular and attentive in classes.. :) if you had a doubt and couldn’t just figure out what to do..Chithra was the person to go to… when you look at her looking at a problem..you realize how calm a person can be.. very responsible.. always encouraging… I like to get appreciated by her.. :) Have one semester with you.. and I really thank god for that.. Be the way you are.. always.. I like you very much :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khayali-jain">Khayali Jain</a></p>

<p>Chitra was the first bitsian I met in campus. ‘She is tall!’ was the first very obvious impression. We didn’t really talk much except for hi-hello while passing by and small chats here and there. She is a very sweet person. I would have missed my exams in 1st year if she wasn’t there to wake me up at 8.15 (for 8.30 exam). Then I had a huge respect for her when I came to know she is 001, being Kerala state board topper. And the respect only grew with her reaction ‘Kerala board exams are easy, it’s not a big deal to score’ She has a very basic funda of fodufying acads, regularly revising/studying what is being done in classes (that’s what is difficult for people, but you manage it pretty well). She used to be early-to-bed-and-early-to-rise person till 2nd year. I guess EEE changed her :P Thank you Chitra for being a really nice neighbour whom I could ask for anything, assignment sheets, MT2 calculations, sellotape, pen etc.. Will miss seeing you every day.. With your hardwork and dedication you will definitely have a bright future! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>She’s the person who will be known by everyone in the campus and the reason being: The “001”…yeah she’s the ONE (btw that’s how I searched ur name in melange;no search results for chithra…but found u for “001” :P :P). She is tall, decent, sincere, hardworking, calm (only at appearance :P), intelligent, passionate, determined, organized(I don’t hav much space to write more..so ending it :D) and also one of those persons whom I(everyone for tat matter) respect a lot. She has got her own way of enjoying things and having fun. She’s always a mystery to me…how can she manage ACADS, NIRMAAN, fun all at the same tym soooo perfectly!!! But how??!!! Seriously I never got it, in spite of being the president for Nirmaan-goa u still managed to score 9+ in ur CDC :O :O Man!!!I’ve never seen a person with such a superb brain (haa atleast one can expect that from the 001 :P). She’s an awesome leader cool, composed, listens to everyone patiently and then answers, which can never be questioned back (the perfect way). She was the one who always listened to many of my ideas and yeah even tried to implement few of them. See that’s the best part about you as a leader, you give equal importance to everyone and you never let any idea go unthought-of. 
She has that typical mallu hair (lovely one I say :P). The farewell day can’t go unmentioned…I still doubt was it really you??!! What a makeover!!! The most memorable day will be tat rotaract club barbecue party in Bogmalo…no I’m not talking abt the barbecue…I’m talking abt the “Fatima-Vijayendra Varma” story :D :D…the twin u are :D…yeah I know that each and every outing we had in NIRMAAN will be memorable :D :’), especially the “I Paint, I Paint, I Paint” day…lol!!! I’m soooo sure that you have a great future ahead!!Get ready for it!!and all the best….Keep smiling Chechi!!!

<p>"The Perfectionist"!I really do not know if I am even eligible to write a testimonial for her! She has been everyone's ideal in Nirmaan-Goa. Her 

dedication, her passion, her patience in dealing with all the problems, her sincerity, her comitment to her tasks, her time management make her 

the most ideal person you would ever meet.Its really amazing to see her take decisions, especially considering everyone's interests. Really admire 

 and respect her for thinking in terms of everyone's point of view! I simply adore her simplicity :).The smile which she somehow manages to put 

on her face heals half of the problems.The "001" is down-to-earth, humble,modest, very caring and what not.She is just so awesome in whatever 

she does,be it the Presidentship of Nirmaan Goa or a rockstar in her acads. We did have good memories together, thanx to the birthday 

celebrations and outings for which she manages to find time inspite of her busy schedule. I was one of her lucky friends to see the fun part of 

her.Her personality is just unmatchable! She is one of my real-life inspirations. I consider it more than an honour to have met her and I would be 

really glad to stay in touch with her :). Keep inspiring people and all the very best for your great future ahead! Thank you for being my friend- 

PM :).PS: I would love to see you paint :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
