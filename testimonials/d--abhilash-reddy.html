<p>I don't want to speak much about his talent....as Nareal awards proved that he is multitalented...I don't know much about his talent until I worked with him for Ugadi...He is the one who carried the whole show with his talent...Not only that he is the chief co-ordinator of DORAH about which I don't know much..:P. He had also made plans for starting a company after his engineering (of coarse I was already placed in that..:P). Besides all these he is one of my department mates who helped me a lot in writing reports, assignments, and lot more...I was stunned by his following in the campus...I wish him all the best for his future....kummu :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tirupati-kumud-kumar-srivatsava">TIRUPATI KUMUD KUMAR SRIVATSAVA</a></p>
<p>aB you can attract anyone towards you and they will feel lonely in your absence. I enjoy your company and you have always supported me in many ways (apart from acads  :P) and hope you would lend your support to me in future too. You will do the things your way which makes you someone apart from the general jantha. :P Your confidence and your attitude are your survival gears which helps you to become leader in any field you step into.

<p>The hero of campus and that awesome chap who belonged to AH4 once. His personality is awesome and charismatic and I m sure he can definately make a career in Tollywood. One of those few people from down south who speak clear Hindi, his attitude and friendliness is worth appreciating. The true sportsperson who plays cricket badminton with sheer dedication, his work as DORA Chief is worth a mention. His decisions and his understand is apt and quick, one of those few people who put fests or work more than personal benefits.
Be it dancing for Zephyr or that much popular moon walk, he's ready for entertainment and keep it up.  Ab its a treat knowing you macha ! 
You are a traitor and will be the same for your life. 
All the best for ur future, achieve great heights, and make a movie.

PS. If you become actor autograph de dena mujhe ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
