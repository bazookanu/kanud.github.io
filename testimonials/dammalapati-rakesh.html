<p>Though he is a senior I felt him as if he was my batch mate and I was that close to him.And he was guide to me many a times in many aspects.One important(funny) thing about him is he love sleeping and there are times when he even missed few days in his dairy sleeping(as he told me). Little lazy but works hard to accomplish tasks.Made UGADI 2012 a grand success with all his efforts.Feeling very sorry to miss you but as I don't have any other alternative I've to accept it.Hope that we would maintain our relationship as we are from the same place and wish you all the very best for your future..urs-sathwik.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nunna-sathwik">Nunna Sathwik</a></p>
<p>hey rakesh when i first met u in ur first yr ,i thought u were a quiet , nerd ,introvert but after spending the next 3 yrs i realized  you were the complete opposite an extrovert. You  have all the quality's that are required to be a successful person. Awesome Coord for DOS \m/ and andhra samithi. Dedicated and worked your ass out :D in all the 3 yrs. Keep this attitude going man u vl achieve what u want ....cheers :) ....all the best ra for ur future :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Rakesh... One of my laziest and best friends. Loves to go against the rules. Very short tempered, he can get angry over the most silly things in life. But you are a very good person at heart. Once you consider someone as a friend, you'll make sure he stays like a friend forever, no matter what.
I have so many things to tell you. You always keep saying that you are very unlucky, i dont agree with this thing totally. You can change things in your life and make them the way you want them to be but you know what is stoping you from doing this? Your short temperedness. Trust me, come over this thing and you'll have a world filled with happiness. Now that I've known you for 3 years and seen you work for DOS (now DOSAR), UGADI and most importantly as the secretary for KERNEL, I can very confidently say  that if you love to do something, you give it more than your 100%. You are a very dedicated person towards the things you really want to do, but the problem is there are very few things you really want to do (:P). 
I will miss you so much man. The night outs and the study hours together, the pact "YOU SEC, ME COORDI", the projects, the seminars and presentations and all that we did together has been memorable. We've spent a lot of time together in BITS life, shared almost every good and bad thing that came along. What I feel about is, YOU TRULY ROCK MAN, i mean it. Please see life positively, it has so much in store for you. I assure you that you will achieve all that you have dreamt of.

There are a million things i want to say about you, obviously cannot write in everything here. But I promise to be with you, to stay in touch forever.

<p>hey rocky. Though i knew him from the first year . we became very close only when there were come events or fests. I truly admire the perseverance he has got to get things done.He cares for  everyone and even though he does not  show it openly i bet he loves each and every friend more than himself. I enjoyed the journalism classes together where we used to abuse the teacher and laugh it off during lunch.  Ugadi-2012 has been a memorable experience and it couldnot have been one bit without you.i hope you reach greater heights and more importantly enjoy watever u do.  rakseh mama, i truly love you. always keep in touch.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>Rakesh....though in the same discipline...i saw him in my first year in bhavana's chemistry class who used to answer all questions posed by ma'am....my first impression of him was he was not our "kind" as i was a backbencher.....we started really talking only after he became our "K-SEC" in 2nd year....we all used to df him like hell......and from the start of 3rd year we really were close.....he is one guy who when convinced to do something would give anything and get it done.....that is how we became close when we were convincing him to take position......and since that very time i knew him well.....in the second sem it was much more.....he is a very kind and caring...there used to be many ngts wen we used to call him outside his hostel and sit and talk....though he used to plead to go off to his room we made him sit and he sat all the time for us.....he can do anything for a person.....he is impulsive about actions but not about judging people...he always has a soft corner for all the people he knows and is always ready to help them in whatever manner they need it.....BUT roOk!E I never got to understand one thing...i wasn't in ur hostel neither i worked for ugadi nor i was in ur department.....BUT how is dat man we became so close.....i never thought of it before writing this....dnt knw just struck me.....and do call me when going to reddy's house.....i will be there waiting to run :P..........love u darling<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bharath-janyavula">bharath janyavula</a></p>
<p>Rakesh aka As-co..the only thing that made us close friends is DoSaR (previously DoS)..thanks to it..because that's an amazing journey and all the moments we spend arguing and discussing about all the dept matters made us even close ..if in some times his ideas and mine wont match ...then its the time i will take lite but he continuously improving them..this is what makes him special as a coordinator..he is very dedicated to work..ugadi 2012 is the one such example of it..
coming to the second side ..he is very lazy  and always with a sleepy face (except during work) ...he is more interested in updating his profile pic in FB which he spent hours (some times days also..)..and also busy playing games in his lap..his taste of clothing is great...he is very supportive and been helpful to me..and to many others also..all those naughty jokes he will tell are very funny....he will achieve any thing in his life..his commitment to work is amazing..all the best to your future..:P

<p>Hi rakhi I still remember the day in the senior room with our ragging session. It was our first meeting. You are very lazy, very kind and humble person. Your very nature is to help friends which I love the most in you. Most of the time you spend time with your IS family :P.  You are also very humorous at times and also short tempered. Never try to wake this IDIOT while he is in his deep sleep :P (as all of us know what happens :D).  Try to keep yourself and I will miss u. :(     Vijay<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>first thing comes to mind when i think abt u are those EG days, those were really horrible days , remember once we ran to ah4 at around 11 pm to get EG sols and we were just on tym to hostel that tym we had those timing restriction :P. You are really pure from heart and really nice person to talk with. The best thing abt u is your innocence and helping nature and you never forget your frds.Keep going the same way. I wish you a great future a head  :))))

<p>Rakesh the SEC of IS(more specifically K***-Sec :D)!!!hahha tat’s how u always strike me…I was really impressed the way he brought more unity among IS people, as a secretary in our 2nd year. I still wonder how did he manage things so well as a secretary (ppl hardly do nytng as an assoc secretary..Rakesh was completely opposite)..kudos to you ra…well his  so impressive work during his 2nd year gained him many fans in IS :D.
I’ve known Rakesh since my 1st year…I think it was in maths class that we met each other for the 1st tym…later we worked in the placement team together in our 1-2. Since then we had quite a few memorable talks. He is the most humble, friendly, kind person I’ve seen on the campus and yeah he’s a lazy ass!!! 
You are \m/ ra…may it be the Ugadi-2012, IS sec or DOS work…u were perfect in dng ur work and perfect in maintaining your relations with people…one can never forget UGADI-2012: The best organised Ugadi I’ve seen on the campus.
Stay in touch(I mean it!!!)…and all the best for everything…keep smiling :)

<p>Rakesh-dats his actual name but we call him with random names-rakhi,rakia,exsec,sec,ksec are noteworthy among dem.He is one of the best friends of mine who helps a friend in need at ny time.He used to study a lot in the 1st sem of 1st year but now u can watch him in his room batting all over the night.He hardly meets a lecturer in his/her chamber before exams but he makes rounds around the lecturers asking wats wrong with his answer in the answer paper after exms.I will not comment about ur work in DoSar(DOS :P) and ANDHRA Samithi because i know from the bottom of my heart any thing i say about ur work is less.It won't be a complete description if I miss to mention ur cricket strategies and ur unique batting style.Given any batting position,I will bet he can't resist more than 6 balls.If he resists 5 balls he will try his level best to get out for the 6th ball :P.I am wondered u didn't give a try in bowling department in BITS life ;).........will miss u rakhi :(  ATB for ur future and do stay in touch :) urs haleem<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nadella-sriharsha">Nadella SriHarsha</a></p>
<p>Raaki is once such ever active person in our hostel who is always fun to hangout with. Very hardworking and reliable  if he takes a responsibility which i could make out when he was a part of WAVES coco with me and also when he was IS assoc secretary. Apart from these.. hez a STRAT player in gully cricket.... who feels misfielding is a strat to tempt a batsmen to take one more run and get run out ( LOOOOL ) :D. A very helpful friend for those who noe him. The worth mentioning part about his BITS life is when he became Andhra Samithi co-ordinator.... my very 1st thot ....it wont matter much..... But actually it turned out to be different. The way he changed the spirit in Andhra samithi has been a tremendous achievement ..... the UGADI festival which he has organized will be 1 of the memorable 1s for many of them who have contributed for it. To be short .... hez a very able,energitic,ethical leader and a really good frnd. All the best raakhi!. We'l keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/m-s-sandeep">M S Sandeep</a></p>
<p>Rakiiii darling never knew who was rakesh till 1st year spree. He was in the same department DOS.. It was in the second year that we became good friends. We are not in the same hostel but today is he one of my best frnz. Thats how departments play a crutial role in bitsians life. I remember the times we used to sit on the campus benches and talk about relationships and consoling each other when needed. Those were memorable. Apart from this he is a great organizer and a had a huge fan following. A candidate contesting in the campus elections must and ll definitely meet him for his advice. The way he made this year Ugadi a big success proves his organizing skills. He also played an important role in uplifting our dept.  standards. He always makes sure that all the people are satisfied with his decision. I am damn sure that where ever you go and what ever you do  you ll be the best... Cant wait to spend time with you next sem we ll rock... all the best ma luv u :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/k-radha-krishna-vinay-kumar">K Radha Krishna Vinay Kumar</a></p>
<p>Rakesh is like friend everybody want. He is so kind, friendly. IS sec, K-sec _/\_ :P. I still dont know why i didnt talk much with him till my 2-2. He did batting with Anushka a.k.a Arundhati. U rocked UGADI 12 and Andhra  Samithi also :P. I think u r very innocent :) donno much abt ur crushes.. U have to guide us to swim 3-1 ocean :P. U have a great vision ALL THE BEST for ur future :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/null">NULL</a></p>
