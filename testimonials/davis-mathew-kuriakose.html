<h1 class="page-title">Davis Mathew Kuriakose</h1><p>I don't know from where to start...i met him on the very first day of this BITS journey and we became friends. He is full of emotions. Anyone can make him fool, but because of his smiling, supportive and care free nature no one can be bad to him. He is 25 years but still he behaves like a 5 year old..He is affraid of RATS lol.. When he is happy (means only when he is going home) he dances..but sorry to say, he is not a good dancer. He got a good patience power. He is talened with good coding skills and can't see anyone unhappy because of him. He is passionate about driving cars. He eats a lot that you will know after seeing him ;) . If he finds a Mallu he will forget about everything..even if its Biju Sir's project submission the next day. He is very good from heart. If you are in trouble he will always be there for you. But sometimes he gets depressed. Just remember one morning this dark night has to end. So be cool and positive. Lucky to have him as a friend. I wish him all the best for the future..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankush-khurana">Ankush Khurana</a></p>
