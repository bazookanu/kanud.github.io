<h1 class="page-title">Debanjum Singh Solanky</h1><p>Talk about multi-talented and Debanjum is the first person who comes to my mind. Be it playing harmonium, guitar, flute, karate, or flair for mathematics this guy has it all. He is the who wore kurta on the farewell not bothering about what other people would think of him, which is one quality of him that i really admire. To cut a long story short this guy has provided me with many memorable moments and certainly added that extra spice to my college life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-kumar-jha">Amit Kumar Jha</a></p>

<p>Deba, Carlos, Kelso, Dibbi, the nicknames for Debanjum are never ending. I still remember Debo the first time I met him (sitting in Amit's room, messaging away and then laughing at something with his usual "dumb" laughter). Debo has gotta be one of the biggest wannabes on campus and likes to think he is a party starter. One of the most adventurous people I've ever met (though his adventures are often failed ventures) its been awesome fun knowing this chhakka over the past few years. One of the most lively persons in our grp, he can be exceedingly irritating and a butt of all jokes in equal measure. We've spent a lot of time over the past sem (thanks to Nob's "commitments") and its been great to see the more academic side of him. I still hate you for downing me that Whisky shot and for a lot of other things but then, sadly, your irreplaceable. Hope you sprout some brains soon and best of luck for the future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>WHAT DEBO THINKS HE IS:
Smart. Party Starter. Talented. Funny. Incredibly Handsome.
WHAT DEBO ACTUALLY IS:
Dumb. Party pooper. Talentless. Sad. Incredibly pimply. :-P

And yet Debo continues to live a blissful existence in his fantasy world. But for a guy who's read The Inheritance series, The Lord Of the Rings, Harry Potter and (currently) A Song of Ice and Fire, hes right in his space.
And hes great company! :-D
Some of my most fun moments in BITS have been with him. His desperate attempts to get us to drink, making him watch 'teeth', spending so many hours with him doing absolutely nothing, treating his room like our common room, irritating the hell outta him, getting ass-whooped by him in return, his lil countdown(3...2....aur next kya aata hai, betaji?) to threaten you outta his room, nearly going to Vasco topless, watching people fall over at Curlies, getting on board a goods train....WOW the list is long!!!

Its incredible how this guy is just so unique! There is absolutely NO ONE ELSE like him (okay, his brother comes close. :-P). He sorta got me hooked to the idea of going to the library to study. Its a shame, i haven't seem him there of late much though. :-P 
He keeps surprising you with his antics-he walks into the mess with a Goa Carnival pride Parade mask on. He ends up at the farewell in a kurta. Or he wears a curtain to class.
This guy is lively and incredibly fascinating! 
Sometimes he does surprise me when I actually begin to think hes got a brain down there somewhere-lost below all that hair! Especially when he's working on his 'life' code.
He going to Ah-6 is still the most depressing thing about 4-1. Shift somehow!
 
Here's to an awesome life ahead to you man-live out your fantasy, Khaleesi.
And ya, learn a lil football along the way too. Make sure you don't get lapped at the least :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maanit-mehra">Maanit Mehra</a></p>
<p>Debo! Dude, I think I am gonna rant for sometime now :D! For starters, Debanjum is as funny, as weird and as unique as his name is. An avid reader of all the fantasy books, this guy likes to live in his own fantasy world. (Talk to him about war, elves, dragons and jedis he gets all charged up like a 4 year old kid for all the action and dhishoom dhishoom. Guess it all comes with his Rajputana genes :D )This guy has a different (and generally good :P) taste for music. And, then he's also a thinker :D (okay. yes on some levels he is) Although, he just likes to think and never 'Do' anything about it :P .Most of times, he will be in deep slumber. Sleeping like a log, waking him up is a challenging ritual for all his neighbors. Debo's also got a penchant for wearing curtains (One is with all this weird designs of elephants asses 
on them! :D) He also finally turned up at the farewell in a kurta (He's got his own shit philosophies albeit not this one) Shit keeps happening around with him. So be it getting a bike stolen and re-discovering again on the same day, missing trains on numerous occassions the list goes on and on :D But it's insane fun to just be with him. He's the one from our group who comes up with all the random plans and nonsense adventures some of which have really turned out well. Seriously, the 14 km trek along the rails, coming back on an engine of a cargo train amidst the rains, the epic one day 500km ride, the night at Curlies :D We dd it all, man! Last 3 years wouldn't have been the same but for him and his antics. He is one unique sample piece from Delhi I am glad to have known and lived along. Here's to all the lifetime of epicness :D . May the Stars Shine Down Upon You!! Cheers!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurabh-nayak">Saurabh Nayak</a></p>
