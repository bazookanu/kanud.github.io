Calm and sensible among all of us ...The one who will always be there for those mongi tp's we have after dinner :P  U are the one who me and saumya could always count in for ny plans we made even before we asked u ...though its execution is a completely different issue :P Those stupid movies which u would watch,dose old songs which we would sing around you to irritate you,those awesome time spent on benches,those train journeys,dose crazy jokes which none of us wud get nd u guys will go crazy about...i'll miss all dese yaar..... U are as lazy as anyone can get and i dnt know how can sumone sleep so much.....Most funny, the way u would cut all paneer pieces into small equal sizes before u start dinner :P I have never seen nyone so slow and so organised at eatin food :P

<p>Deepak, Chief Coordinator of Department of Backstage n Infrastructure, an electronics n robotics geek(he will always have an answer to any question u have ), gamer ,”the only pakka engineer of the group” as mehra once quoted ….even though he does soo many things, he is one of the laziest person I know :P……I never thought any1 could sleep more than 12 hrs each day and still feel sleepy !!! :D….even though  he is lazy, he is never late, he will always be on time (exceptions included)….that is the most amazing this about him……extremely good listener and one of the most helping guys I know of….he is also the most level-headed guy and  keeps his cool even in the most hectic situations( dunno what I would have done without u in quark, probably burned the audi down :P)…..extremely obsessed with his  computer….tries to push it to its absolute limits ( slave driver :P )……don’t think he attended classes worth a month in the last 2 years in college :D :P
He is extremely dedicated in whatever he is doing and when he gives it all there is nothing he can’t achieve…..All the best for ur future…..and looking forward to one full semester of fun u wont be sleeping a lot if u want ur computer in one piece :D :P
