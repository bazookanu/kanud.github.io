<p>Deeeeepooooookkkkk....Kaha se shuru karu??? I wrote endless testimonials for this guy and deleted them because they were nothing but a gross injustice to the character of this "imba: person i have known for three years. Deepak Kesri is a very dear friend and not a single day has passed in this campus without being together for atleast one meal(bfast ,nc whatever). The first time i met him he was completely different. Very quiet at first. Par jab bolta hai toh sabki waat laga deta hai !! He is very good at pulling peoples legs. Everyday he makes fun of me , be it a dota game or something related to acads, and believe me it cracks me up too :D . Speaking of academics , his pre college marks speak a lot about his talents and potential. After coming to college he learnt to take li8 and has been very consistent at it XD .  Mehnati nahi aisa batlata hai, Lekin jo thaan le, karke dikhata hai. His habit of betting even on the smallest of matters , his keen eye for detail (and hence the numerous victories) has won him immense respect in the group.  Quick witted, fun loving, a simply amazing person. He appreciates beauty like no other. He has exceptional ability to analyze the figure and facial features of any girl and criticize them accordingly in a manner ,which I guarantee you, will leave you in splits  . And if you have a bizarre sense of humor (like deepu), which appreciates banter and ridicule, there's no better person to hang out with. His interests have changed over the years. But still a child at heart he likes watching WWE and keeps all of us updated about the latest matches. His sleeping hours are legendary _/\_. He can sleep from 10 pm to 10 am and then again sleep from 2pm to 8 pm . Deepak is good at sports and games too. He always sets new records in the games on my mobile. A pro Dota player, he has earned the respect of one and all with his extraordinary gaming skills(aakhir sikhaya kisne ?? :P).  It's been great knowing you. I am sure you will excel in your life if you work hard and stay true to yourself. I have only one thing to say about deepak:  "Banda yeh bindaas hai" \m/  :)

<p>Its hard to describe the time we've been friends in a testimonial, but here goes.

All of this started with a small game of cricket, progressed to TT and the fact that we had no laptops and that we lived quite close meant that we used to talk for hours and hours about anything, anything at all. I remember our 2-hour long chats about the world, about girls, about music, about movies, about girls, about our school lives, about girls, continuously cracking jokes about people, DFing pappu, cursing studies and teachers and other things, etc, etc. :)

Deepak Kesri. The guy who I used to give crash courses in MOS, an hour before the exam. The guy who went through TV shows at the speed of light. The guy who would continuously break my records in RacingMoto. The guy with a million empty Coke bottles lying around in his room. The guy who would curse Shahi food and would eat it everyday. I still remember our group's brilliant bike trips (especially the one with the gigantic snake). Also, the times during Waves when we used to roam around B-dome for the noble purpose of ogling. The times when we took upon ourselves the responsibility of demolishing Pappu's three jars of Faleros. Ah, those were the days. 

Finally, here comes the praising wala part. This guy oozes with talent; exceptionally intelligent, excellent TT and DotA player, possesses the god-given gift of not getting fat even after eating outside almost everyday, has brilliant eyesight during exam time, can continuously make of fun of people (for eg. Chonchoo), has an extremely amiable attitude. Well, Deepak, since our time here comes to an end, you will forever be one of my best friends, and you and your awesome humour will be missed sorely when you will leave for your PS. I hope that it all works out for you in an awesome manner.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-raj-pant">Aditya Raj Pant</a></p>
