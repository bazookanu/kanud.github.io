<h1 class="page-title">Deshpande Tanuj</h1><p>Hey prof, my inspiration in the campus.....
The guy who cares a lot about others and is a friend who is always there for you. Wish you were here in the next sem my friend, you will be dearly missed.
Thanks for teaching us a new dialect of Hindi which will go down as an ancient language in the future just like Hebrew.:P
aur kya, all the best bolne hai, khana khane hai aur football dekhne hai! Wish you a \m/ life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>Everyone calls him Entra. He is a friend like no other. He'll always be with you,no matter what. He's a true friend who cares and thinks about everybody & has a big heart. He doesn't react to petty jokes and ridicule or as he says, "Main SOONSAAN aadmi hoon." His Hindi hasn't improved even a bit in the last four years while ours have deteriorated. It is really sad that he is going for PS in the first semester. We would all miss him. Good Luck buddy!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>Entraaa.... A awesome guy,always helping,caring and thinks lot for others.Whenever you are sad or ill ,this guy will always be there to help you out.Though a bit lazy and ex-regular NC eater,a few little tyres on tummy and humorous entra hindi,he is one among few who I have seen who do what they want,try to follow his passion no matter what.Regularly he goes for tennis and football and plays computer games too.I have'nt played comp. games with him but have seen that he has improved lot over the years.Though he himself may not follow his words,his ideas have a deep and profound meaning.He is a child at heart but extremely mature in understanding issues."Mey NC janey hein,","Meydem ke pass janney hai","Mein Khaney hai""Mein Pelney hai"...Your words will always be memorable.You have taught me how to remain calm in life no matter what situation.He is happy to see other others happy.A true selfless person.His presence of mind is also very good.I just wish you find really good work in PS and utilize your potential to fullest.May all your dreams come true.Best Wishes :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shabbar-a--vejlani">Shabbar A  Vejlani</a></p>
