<h1 class="page-title">Dev Rishi Khare</h1><p>the past 3 years hv made me realize ki dev se bada kamina koi nahi ho sakta..dev se zyada bakwaas koi nahi kar sakta...n no1 can embarrass  u in public like he can.....but the past 3 years hv also made me realize that this time wudnt have been so much fun without him..no matter how much he has irritated me, it's always been laughed out at the end. There have been moments when i have wanted to rip his head off, but he has also given me some of the most funniest, enjoyable and memorable moments of my college time... :)

<p>He can amaze anyone with the way his mind works in all the nonsense theories he comes up with, be it his stupid efforts to link everyone or be it his comments on what we wear or  
 some higher order analysis of a simple joke to the level we wont even think of :P
   He has cum up wid all sort of names for me with his high level intelligence. :P
 I cant ever forget all the chappal fights i had with you.I dint ever have chappal fights with my brother d way i hav had dem with you.
 And yeah  dat claudi incident.Only u  cud hav been mad enuf to do dat.
 U are d one who has given me all physical injuries(remb d scooty ride) nd den instead of sayin sorry askin to sign it:P 
 But still somehow its hard for me to imagine what my college days wud hav been without u or will be the next semester.
  U hav kept us smiling wid all ur bakwas all dis way through.
 Thank me because i was the one jiski wajah se u met arunima :P
 I really am glad dat we met in physics class nd hav beeen friends ever since.
 I remember u sayin dat we will cry when u are nt here :P Well i m not sure of dat :P but I m definitely goin to miss u loads!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khushboo-matreja">Khushboo Matreja</a></p>
<p>Dev….i can write pages about him and still these pages will not be enough to describe the person he is…..had it not been for him my years in this college would have been  very different…the CEO of LnL Co. :P …..he is one of the most fun loving persons and would do things just for the fun of it be it teasing or fight :D ……when I first entered this college I was scared to talk to any girls….dev noticed this and he took the responsibility of teaching me upon himself to teach me the art of talking to girls (as he says) :P :D…..even though sometimes he used to drop a few bombs suddenly out of nowhere(diwali ka atom bombs  :P )  like the one in c-mess in first year  where I was told, “this is the girl u are going to prom with,ask her!!” (SCARY!!!!) :D  :P…….dev cares a lot about others , he won’t  think twice in helping people and he will be there for u even before u can ask him for anything……..he is one of the most hot headed persons I met, likes to fight (had to stop him a few times in badminton court else how would have hit some senior :D :P )….even though he is brash and all, he is very emotional person ( don’t think he will accept it :D )……when is angry he talks a lot about many different things and people to you, but i don’t think he means any of it ( had to listen quite a bit in our first year ….didnt understand then, now I do :P :D ) ….it’s just a way to release his anger.......but sometimes he does speak out and unintentionally hurts others…….if someone asks y he did it, the answer is dev is dev as I say, no reason needed :D :P  ..but he will apologize in his own way later on…… it’s always been fun sharing moments with you and others, the fights in your room during our T2 preperation, eating at NC n andapav, talking random things at mongi n bench or teasing khushboo, saumya or even Deepak mercilessly, having fun at festivals or hurling bombs at people during Diwali, playing dota and hurling abuses at each other in the game and most importantly the chats we had bogmalo with mehra :D …..you have been there to listen to me whenever I was down and always there to cheer me up, always there to help (even though u did push me into some tight situations :-D ) and I was always jealous of u and always will be :)….we will definitely have more of these moments together for sure later on for sure , not going to leave u alone :D :P …….ur biggest strength is ur confidence in yourself, never lose it, its not a trait many have while u have it in abundance….. ….not going to ask u to stay in touch cauz I will find n kill u if u don’t :P :D… listen to ur heart and sometimes brain :P and the rest of the world will have no option but to bow before you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/moheth-koppolu">Moheth Koppolu</a></p>
<p>in one word - zestful.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nachiketa-dash">Nachiketa Dash</a></p>
<p>Dev is one f d guys who think dey r d coolest....well guess wat the saddest part is....he actually is!!he a keeper as a frnd.no matter how much fun he makes f u, he's got ur back wen u'll need it :P well actually d more fun he makes f u d closer u r to him (he'll kill me for saying dat!)Every1 knows bt no1 understands how u become d centre f attraction everywere we go!! I guess its d 'DEV' effect :P :) u can never ever find a guy as simple as him... he's a little slow wen it cumes to understanding others or himself for dat matter but he understands more dan he likes to pretend he does ;) He'll tell you dat he cares in d most subtle ways, sumtimes touching ur heart so much dat u'll nt even realize wat he actually did for u by just being dere.I love d way u speak ur heart n d way u envision things without any constraints;how u r d most conventional yet d most open minded person i've ever known.Being wid u makes me feel more secure and loved than i ever thought of.u've been wid me in all my rough times nd held me through dem wid extreme understanding.u understand me even wen i cant make sense out f my own talks n make me laugh even wen u r makin fun me itself!! n i luv u for making everything so simple for me. u've got wat it takes to make one's dreams come true...just listen to ur heart n one day u'll make it bigger than u've ever dreamt of . (P.S.:keep my share aside.) I dnt kno wat future holds for us, but one thing i kno is dat we'll be friends till d end :')<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arunima-chaudhary">Arunima Chaudhary</a></p>
<p>In one word zestful , in two zestful and unabashed.
You have earned a lot of names these past 011 years :) A !@#^$*%[guess :P] and a friend :) The boldest and unscrupulous of us all :) It takes time getting used to you :P and the fact that you tend to speak out openly what most would restrict to just their thoughts if at all :P Ever eager to help friends out , you bring you own brand of 'help' that they might not necessarily want at all times. Nevertheless, it usually ends with them cursing you and thanking you as well . And that is a talent in itself :) 
Your inane and round about hypothesis-es are always amusing :P You have random incomprehensible (to me) deductions abt ny1 and every1 .. and an inordinate amt 
of confidence in them :) You also hold the distinction of being the owner of the bed i've least slept in among the 4 of us :P (your loss) :P :P
Being passionate, emotional , vocal , and querulous make you what you r :) you have your own ideas on what you want from your life (everything) and live to experience 
it to the fullest :) and i'm sure you'll get every b i t you want, out of it :) tc :) thank you for 011 unforgettable years :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nachiketa-dash">Nachiketa Dash</a></p>
<p>Talk of teasing,mocking and bamn! dev comes to my mind... mocking people is his way of connecting and making friends....sometimes it hurts you really bad(u hv to make him realize that otherwise he'll never know) but sometimes those are the moments which will really leave u smiling,laughing ...GLOBE talks unforgettable!!....an extremely frank guy...never trying to please anyone (except one :P ) has a very short lived memory .. u have to keep reminding him the favours  u have done to him (if u remember... what im talking about nd if you do remember u can thank me!).....all said and done he is enthusiastic and  fun to be with...... best of luck for all future endeavours :) :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-jain">sakshi jain</a></p>
