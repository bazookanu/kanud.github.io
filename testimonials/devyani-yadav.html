<h1 class="page-title">Devyani Yadav</h1><p>Not quite often do you get to meet people to whom you can tell anything and everything without ever fearing that you will be judged.. I'm so glad that i met one of those rare kind.. Devyani (Feels so weird calling u that.. U r apni Bulbul).. And i guess that is "kinda" the reason that makes her my best friend.. She is my Confidante rather than the interrogator which is usually the case.. Keeps listening to everything u have to say without question which is usually not the case when ur trying to explain stuff.. Its just so easy with u bulbul.. :') Easily amongst one of the prettiest humans i have ever met.. She has crazy fashion dreams and deep down inside i have a selfish motive for her to do something great in that field so that i get an awesome fashion designer friend who gives me free clothes <evil grin> nd makes me look super awesome!! And i don't even know why i am mentioning this but both our hearts stop beating at one name - Alessandra Ambrosio.. The one angel that lives on Earth!! :D
I have all kind of crazy names for D!! some of which she likes.. some which she doesn't but i call her with those anyway.. Coz i find sadistic pleasures in troubling people that are real close to me <evil grin again>.. Oh.. How can i forget this - Gtalk!! Bulbul i think u get it... I don't need to say anything more..
A total Family person, very down to earth, knows Hindi pretty well.. or at least she thinks she does, will die to learn french at any point in her life (don't really know if she'll succeed but I'm proud that she makes a genuine effort :D), has crazy ideas about a surgery known as liposuction..(talk to her someday on this.. you'll curse me why i gave u this point of discussion in the first place :P), and last but definitely not the least - An honorary member of the elusive and exclusive 'Flubbers' Gang!!
Bulbul.. College life wouldn't have been the same without you.. And I'm so glad that in my journey of life i met a person who is so special.. I'm sure that you are gonna make it very big in life.. And then 10 years down the line when we meet in Paris, I'll borrow u from your boyfriend for one day.. And if he doesn't allow then we will give him a big kick in the butt and then we will go Bungee Jumping from the Eiffel Tower!! Loads and Loads of love to you Bulbul!! All the very best in life.. Keep Smiling Always.. And don't worry.. I will be around for quite a while.. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mudit-sinha">Mudit Sinha</a></p>
<p>Bulbul a.k.a birdie is the first friend i had on campus and dude we are still going strong( with some bumps in the road :P) \m/...She is the kid of the 'parivaar'. I still remember the all night talks we had answering your doubts!!!...:P...Her presence makes the surroundings
chirpy( afterall u have some quality of a bird!!..:P) and happy!!...Her hair are her priced possessions!!.(she will run her hands through them every 10 seconds :P)..She is the person who sleeps all through the nights on a night out!! And of course how can I forget to mention the 'Deadly Trio' man!!...:D...We had some real epic moments at ice n spice and CP ( and not to forget our very recent escape incident on the terrace :D)..She is also a very quick learner and an excellent student( The French lessons we had \m/...had cramps in my stomach laughing that day...Oh mon dieu!!!...:P)...Time just flew by since the first year and we had our share of awesome fun!!...Bulbul i think its high time that you prove yourself to be a bird( we have never seen you fly :P)!!...Have a rocking time ahead!!...Miss you birdie!!...:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>Hello Birdie... Well she is one of those people oops birdies who are pretty grounded, they just never fly.She is one of my first friends on campus and we have been friends ever since.I still remember u,me and Kirti sitting for hours and laughing like crazy,getting high on coffee and those movie sessions in Dahiya's room.She is this completely sweet and sophisticated kid who is always smiling.One of her major aims in this campus has been to improve my Hindi and she tries very hard but it just doesn't works out for me :P .Like most birds she likes being all chirpy and social and like most eco people she cries a lot about her cdc's (get a break birdie). It has been one awesome journey with you till now .Hope u take that flight and get all that you desire.Gonna miss you... :'(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>
<p>Very different kind of a person or shall i say bird she is. Well known as bulbul in our parivaar :D. Very talkative n joyous person. If you are sitting besides her, she won't stop talking....she has something or the other to say :P. She is very good at every language you know, and even if you make a very small grammar error, she will correct you instantly. Her nakhre -------> "EPIC" _/\_ :D. Everything she wants perfect!! When we went to mahbaleshwar, she didn't sleep for the whole night on day1 because der was some smell (not so bad) coming from the blanket. And rest of the days, after we changed our acco, all she did was sleeping. Spent hours sitting together either at ice n spice or nescafe n just chatting for hours nn creating woderfull memories to cherish for lifetime. I still remember the leg stamping fight we had outside the library.....it was so much fun :)). Der is some kind of optical illusion in her appearance (one she is very proud of).......she looks very tall from far......but once you go n stand beside her......she looks like a dwarf :P. Very caring and nakhrebaaz friend. Will miss you bull-bull :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Devyani and I really really go a long Way!!! the first time we me met was during registration. The same day i knew we were to be friends for long!!! Ever since she has been a great friend. With all her stupid reactions .... there is something about her that is adorable! She will be the sort who will come to you in times of problem and help you out! I still remember when we were all going to colva and I was freaking out for some test i had messed up; she came up to me and just spoke to me! She has been there in times of need and silently helps you out! Of course shell still be the "grammar corrector" but its still fun to hear her correcting ppl! esp. Basanti!!!! :P With that infectiously adorable smile of yours keep in touch birdieeeeeeeeeee !!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yashu">Yashu</a></p>
<p>I have known her for the the last two semesters...and now i must say that its a pity to have not known her longer. We had an argument last semester, i remember vividly, on who among the two of us was more vella/laid back which i eventually won and she went on to become an 8p. Hence it goes without saying saying that she is hard working. She is very determined straight forward and ambitious. She always has an opinion in all discussions and arguments and stands by it. You can absolutely involve her in all conversations...Random conversations and pulling Parth's leg over his 'list' of girls , long walks around the campus with me literally dragging myself along at snail pace and you complaining about the same were some of the highlights of last semester. Wouldnt miss out on mentioning her nakhre ,but that is all a part of this wonderful vibrant cheerful package. It was a pleasure getting to know you :)

<p>Miss Devyani Yadav!!she is one person i met pretty late in my BITS life. still remember that eco freshers at bogmalo where we had a conversation for the first time and we hit it off straight away. She came across as an easy going,chilled out and down to earth girl-and that impression hasnt changed ever since.She has been my library buddy and a great one at that too.I dont know of anyone else apart from her with whom i could've spent the entire day in that mundane place and not get bored even for a single minute. Her smile really is unbelievably amazing(and coaxing-she made me accompany her to the parlour using that :P) and can lighten someone's moods even in toughest of times. She is real fun to hang out with and trips to bogmalo with her,shivang and ahuja have been real fun. Although easy-going,this girl knows her stuff and has a say on loads of things- ranging from econ to fashion(has a real thing for it) to what not.Heck, she is one of the very few girls who knows "that buddha" who features pretty frequently in sports articles.A typical eco 2009 student, she just cribs about anything and everything when it comes to the subject-be it an assignment or a small,fairly inconsequential,class test.All in all,Devyani is one girl you cant stop yourself from taking a liking to.I really thank my stars that i crashed that eco freshers and met her there cause its been one good year knowing this never sour person. To at least one more year together (in ENI) and more library and bogmalo outings!! I know you dont need it(you are gonna nail it anyway),but best of luck for future.And dont you dare take that smile off your face!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-prakash">Pranav Prakash</a></p>
