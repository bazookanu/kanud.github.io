title: Dhananjay Deepak Sathe

<h1 class="page-title">Dhananjay Deepak Sathe</h1><p>It is impossible to be alive on campus and not know Sathe. Without mincing words, most people refer to him as "weird" - probably the basis of our camaraderie. There appears to exist an almost irreverent passion when it comes to technology. Haven't we all been with him at Mongi/Bogmalo/elsewhere where he charges a tirade of jargon, somehow managing to sound entirely adorable and without hubris.

His unflinching commitment to the open-source culture --spanning technology, music, patents and books-- is a thing to be admired and emulated. He revels in specificity and is always a delight to talk to - with all the sweeping statements, blatant generalizations and maa-behen-ing of Steve Jobs. 

That Sathe will go on to be very famous, scarce and valuable would be an understatement. The hope is that our paths cross en route. :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amrit-pal">Amrit Pal</a></p>
<p>Sathe is easily the most well-known person on campus. But Sathe don't give a damn yo. Sathe is too busy overclocking his processor, accusing Microsoft of being mother-rapists and getting coding epiphanies in the middle of the night. Apart from all that, Sathe is always game for breakfast, and as well all know, Sathe is also the God gamer. On a more serious note, Sathe is a talented programmer and open-source devotee to the point of being labeled a retard. He's gonna be in Silicon Valley chilling out while we sit and figure out what to do next with out lives. And don't you dare wish him good luck, because fuck you, he doesn't need it.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>The first impression he gave was that of a complete showoff. And no, I wasn't so wrong. He so does love to deliberately over-complicate things. But then, this guy out here knows his shit. Can't think of a more fitting person to win the na-real geek god. This is the guy who isn't just satisfied with overclocking his processor. So he tinkers with the voltage levels and burns down his Galaxy S2. This is the guy who got through GSoC, with an air of complete casualness. He's the perfect example of a guy caught in the wrong branch. His love of technology is infectious. Sathe is loud, unapologetic and over-enthusiastic. But behind that there's also a guy who's always ready to help out. You'll never get bored when he's around. (Though you might want to hit him with a brick eventually.) :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Sathe, probably the most famous guy on campus is a sore-house of knowledge (most of that goes above my brains though). The yoyo Linux fan and a great coder. He knows a lot of shit about computers. One can endlessly debate about Google vs Microsoft. He is a true google fan and aims to work there one day. Sathe, is the only guy i know who've successfully completed GSOC project n he doesnt stop boosting about it too. :P
Best of luck buddy.. May you succeed in life <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Sathe, it is impossible to stay calm around this guy!! When I first came to know him , he appeared to be another wannbe geek, but i was so wrong!!( geek god /\) not that he cares too much about it. Sathe is one of those guys with a mind of his own, he will stuff what he wants and not give a shit about what people think. He hardly ever cared for Eni cdc's :D Perfect example of being caught up in the wrong branch, but i don't think that'll matter. With his skills he is sure to go a long way<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>SATHE....SATHE....SATHE.....SATHE.....
He is not just a man. He is a legend. He is Dhananjay Sathe. This guy I will tell you is the most knowledgeable person I know. And also the man that knows how to PARTY!! Most know him as Dhananjay Sathe the arrogant self obsessed boastful fellow. But I know him as my neighbor. The man who has stood by me when I have gone through crap. The man who sleeps in my room after partying at bogmalo. The man who shattered my stupid insecurities. Sathe is not just a Party Animal. But a kind good hearted fellow who will help you raise hell for any matter necessary. If you have been his friend and you will see the world through a whole new outlook. Trust me. The roller coaster ride is still not over. He is one friend I will stand by no matter what!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/edwin-abraham">Edwin Abraham</a></p>
<p>Sathe,I remember the first time we met ,at the basketball court of all places . I felt as if I had bumped into a guy overdosed with adrenaline( and just to clarify, I am not talking about the game here). Later was I to know that I could generalize that to all our interactions. Over-zealous to the point of being infectious, has a menacing laugh that you always get to hear at the middle of the nights and an ENI guy who became an inspiration of sorts for the CSE students. Inspiration,Irritaion ... he manages to do it all. Never cared about his CDCs cause giving a shit would be too mainstream. Best of luck for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritesh-ranjan">Ritesh Ranjan</a></p>
<p>I've known sathe since the day I came to campus. But we bonded more when we knew about our common interest (code). Though most people didn't understand him, I was one of the few persons who could understand whatever he blabbered about gnome, or zeitgeist or bla-bla. I've seen him go from a guy who could use linux to a guy who could hack linux and eventually got a gsoc coz of that.  It was really nice to see him get what he deserved.  And he is growing better and better as the days pass by. From getting to work with zeitgeist to making the committers there mad about him, he's really done a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious job :D  Everybody knows about all the keeda he did with his phone. I won't ellaborate. But yeah he is the only one on campus with an android who has really explored it the most and used it to the fullest. Ok, I won't spread salt on his eni wounds. period. Sathe is very expressive about what he loves and what he does not and that's why lots of people fear him and his rants :P But yeah he has been an awesome friend throughout my campus life and I'll surely miss him. Sathe, hope we see each other in silicon valley soon ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mayank-singh">Mayank Singh</a></p>
<p>The one, the only....SATHE... i saw this guy around 7 years ago in my school during some session in the CCA room... n I thought to myself " wow, he sure is unique" n I wasn't wrong...even thought we are in the same branch ..i got to know Sathe in 3-2 during EIIT n Analog labs...be it doing vellapanti with him while other were working , cursing Shaky,or listening to him ramble on about how he hates ENI or making him sick with my weird 'fetishes' ,u were the one who made EIIT labs bearable. A coding Genius and definitely a BITS Goa Legend.. .. Best of luck for ur future endeavors <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sriram-iyer">Sriram Iyer</a></p>
<p>Sathe in da house. We first met on the sac lawns, where he claimed to be a football and basketball pro. Having dispelled those claims himself through subsequent matches, he did turn out to be a pro at code and gaming. Sathe godgamer. Jokes apart, this guy has filled a place in our hearts that no other idiot can occupy, and we will miss him well and truly. I admire his courage and spirit for taking so much of our shit unflinchingly. For the most part (recall the velino chair -breaking day). GSOC is just the tip of the iceberg, my man, you're the next mark zuckerberg. I truly admire your talent, and wish more people like you filled up engineering school slots in India. Having said that, I'm gonna sing stacey's mom to the tune of...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>The most brilliant coder I have ever met. But your level of sarcasm ain't as good as subiet. That doesn't really matter. I remember it when you told me that you can control your terminal via your mobile. And I was like, f**k, this guy is insane. The more I got to know you, the more I realized your genius. Hats off to you. Adios.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-pant">Aniket Pant</a></p>
<p>Sathinder!, the one word that describes this person perfectly is 'passionate'. Sathe will go to any extent for his passion, may it be coding all night for GSoC, trekking from Bogmalo to Suicide Point or just abusing Microsoft for their incompetence as compared to Linux or Google. Goes to say, Sathe is also very vocal about the same unperturbed by the people who try and make fun of him. D. Sathe or Drunk Sathe happens to be one of the most happening people one may come across. We've had great times at Manipal, not to mention our regular trips to Bogmalo and Velino. Sathe has the capacity to take more shit than any one on campus, another attribute which i respect about him. Sathe, next stop Silicon Valley! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Oh how I'm going to miss your maniacal laugh.

Thank you for introducing me to Linux and keeping me in loop with your work. It has truly been a wonderful experiecnce.

Can't wait to see you take the open source world by storm

<p>Very Obviously, it was my failed VLC Media Player Installation on Ubuntu that made me talk to this Linux Geek and even though he could/did not fix it, I certainly was in awe of all the knowledge that this guy had and still am. The only person On Campus who Codes to Survive and Survives to Code. A delight to talk to but only in small sessions, He's one guy you can never miss. Thanks for all the help and the dsathe wifi. Life would not have been as mobile as it is now =) Wishing you the very best in life and hoping that you get away from this shitty place, we call India, Asap !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>SATHE!! The most popular banda on campus. Love him or hate him, you simply cant ignore him! This guy is nuts abt open source and the most amazing coder i have ever seen in my life. We became friends just like that. Dont even remember when we first met. Its his cool easygoing amiable personality which enables him to overcome others inhibitions. A true coder unlike the Acad kings and queens, this guy knows what he wants from the world and works hard for it. I have had many discussion with him in the world of technology and most of my knowledge in that field is credited to Sathe. A Bayern Munich "fan", turns out he thinks everything abt Germans is the best, from food to beer to women. Listening him rant abt the BITS administration is \m/ A clean hearted person, there is no malice in him and given how nice he is and his chances for success in future pakka, i would never want to lose touch with him! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>I guess I've interacted the most with this guy over lunch (or should I call it breakfast?) in 1-2. With matching nocturnal schedules we ended up in the mess at the same time everyday, discussing operating systems and loopholes in the network among other things. He claimed to be "definitely in the top 3 Linux people on campus" and I thought "What an arrogant ass! I bet he doesn't know shit!". But it has been a pleasure being proven wrong. A brilliant programmer and an open source devotee, this guy's one helluva fearless and outspoken techie and I respect him for that.

Sathe, it has been great knowing you and having all the arguments about a lot of crazy stuff, in spite of seldom having any interactions. I hope I develop as much love for Linux as you and that you start respecting Windows for what it is soon (:P)

And since your career's definitely gonna be spent in Silicon Valley, may you spend your retirement in Germany! Haben ein gutes leben! Cheers!!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>Yo, so getting to the point directly. Sathe, admit it that Facebook uses php. Do not give me an ounce of python scales better than php. If you say that a bytecode python is faster and more efficient than a c++ linked library based php, then you are kidding yourself. Obviously a C++ executable suppoted directly at kernel level will pwn a bytecode executed at a virtual wrapper.
And no, i am not saying that PHP is a good language. It sucks. Not as elegant nor as classy. But atleast in performance terms, Apache + MySQL has better scaling than any out there. Obviously no code is perfect and upstream modifications are needed, and Facebook is a living proof that with modifications, the brilliant GraphApi can also be scaled, no matter how big. This apache works amazingly at server levels with custom OS to minimize cache misses. I doubt any other piece of software has such a big devel team to ensure comparable performance. I mean, come to think of it, Apache also has a license on its name. Not only does it imply big legal team, a huge support community by induction.
What else? Nvidia vs ATi, even I stick with Nvidia. Android vs Apple, android. Laptop vs Tablet? hm.. , Arch vs Ubuntu? depends, Cheese pizza vs banana pizza? :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhaavan-merchant">Bhaavan Merchant</a></p>
<p>Sathe!! How can one not know him on campus! Easily one arrogant GSoCer+linux geek with the looks of Hitler and a special penchant for everything German! He's one guy who can't give a rat's ass to the shitty educational system and pursue his passion relentlessly and make a career out of it. He lives to code(and yes that gets him going places) and of course his love for open source is a constant reminder of the fact that he isn't just another selfish creature, but one whose noble intentions are profound and seek to serve mankind sans boundaries ( ;) )!! Respect for that attitude dude!
We've been friends since I guess the first sem here. It was pretty easy getting to be friends with him. He found me to be an easy target to poke fun at and I noticed that he was no better when it came to that! :P
It didn't take me much time to know about his prowess in coding! He and marcus prove to be the deadliest combo ever and that makes me realize that size doesn't matter at all!! When it comes to conversations, I often fail to understand his jargon, though in bits and pieces I understand what he is talking about! When others talk to him he doesn't understand either, but only that he chooses to be that way! :P
We've had some deadly conversations for hours through the night and he sure is one smart and adventurous jerk! Great guy to hang out with and real plain at heart! 
Knowing you has been a pleasure! Hope to catch up with you in Japan (I've been mentioning this a million times, but you know for what)! 
All the best! Silicon Valley (and pretty soon to be the carbon nanotube valley) awaits you! Code to glory! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
