<p>The smile on his face never fades. This guy maintains his cool demeanor no matter how much pressure he is subject to.... not once have I seen him crib after test marks are out (which often most students end up doing). A fun guy to hang out with... has a good sense of humor. Wish you all the best for your future<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Memories are weird things. You laugh when u remember your embarrassing moments (remember the badminton court when u asked went ask about the score??)and cry when u remember your happy moments(Too many to list...) .Its with these mixed feelings that I am writing this testimonial .We became very close in this third year... and I am really glad... those infinite spent watching "F.R.I.E.N.D.S" along with shahi food , taking a dig at Priyesh (the time is really infinite) and talking about crushes and school life  and lastly acads  (TSSN \m/ :D :D)....basically anything and everything under the sun...A very calm guy and I have never seen u get angry (inspite of being with Priyesh... :D ). An infectious smile  and a "happy go lucky "(i guess this is the perfect phrase for u) attitude and one of the biggest nymphos on campus(By far...). A really good badminton player ,a walking  database about a lot of movies  and tv series and to top it all u really have some grey cells inside head (Bhai ...Micro kaise phod diya??... _/\_ _/\_ )... <p>
<p>
Will always cherish the awesome times spent together ... All the best  and good luck to your future endeavors (which might also include a "classic slide down the shoulder" :P :P ).....    :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
