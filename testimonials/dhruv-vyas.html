<h1 class="page-title">Dhruv Vyas</h1><p>Dhruv Vyas....aka Adidas Vyas...aka Eminem Vyas.... Known to us by several names ( some even unmentionable!!! ;))... But the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this Guy is "Li8"... i mean he's a die hard Gujju... enjoys all the Khakras and Dhoklas and Theplas... but one thing which distinguishes him from others is his "Li8" attitude... So much so that even during class presentations he starts off saying..." My presentation topic is very Li8".. lol.. This guy would be found at two places... During nights, downloading "some stuffs" at B-dome... and during mornings, in his room sleeping peacefully.... Anyways this is an amazing guy... who is full of life... plays awesome guitar... Rumour is that he is also takes guitar classes outside CH-5 (hmm....) Not only that he is awesome in studies as well... known as the God of coding.... (Might take over Microsoft one day)..Plays awesome CS(His nick is Li8 in that as well!!!) 
 So dude, keep up the good work... keep smiling... have an awesome life ahead!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-baokar">Ishaan Baokar</a></p>
<p>I realise that it is indeed very tough to pen down a special person in words when it comes to write about DV! Yup...DV...thats what he likes to be called...though we have several other 'occasional names' for him :P This is one guy who lives by his rules...something that I always imitate him for. Loves 'li8'...to the core! When it comes to friends....he is a spendthrift...eveready for fun! His regularity in attending classes and his stardom as a TA, both truly unmatchable :P He is one person who loves his sleep as much as getting on a high ;) Its the kinda understanding between us that makes every joke more hilarious and memorable too... Its been a really splendid year having spent working with this champ...a mind blowing programmer _/\_ the coolest classmate, project-mate, and above all, a great friend! Dude, I must say, its indeed special to have your company. U'v got an amazing lyf ahead....I can bet on that! Wish you the best in all walks of life (this includes that may all your efforts in sending those sms to your spl person pay off someday soon :P ) ...may you become the kinda 'gypsy' that you aspire to be... And ya, do not forget about the bachelors party that u'v planned :) cheers :D

<p>I dont think some sophisticated words can describe this guy the way he is..but let me try! ;)
DV...one of the most intelligent chaps in our hostel..being said that, he's the laziest as well! He does extreme programming, drinks tea as if he was thirsty for years,studies like he's been chased by a dinosaur, loves music and knows better abt it than anyone, plays guitar...u name it..he does it all.. this guy's a fun package!
As sid said..he taught us the use of famous word 'Li8'! If ur in any kinda predicament, DV will help u out for sure. A complete 'gujju' whn it comes to nature. But i must say, Dhruv is one of the coolest guys I have ever met and indeed one of my closest buddies! I remember all those moments we shared together..u,me,sahu,ranjan, akki...we guys rocked and we always will..! \m/
Finally, I wish u have the brightest future ahead. I know u'll do something out of the world :P And couldn't agree more with sid..may u conquer Dharwad one day..!! :P :D
Looking forward to do that 'concert' with u.. we'll rock the stage soon \m/

<p>Dhruv is the first person whom i will ask for help for organizing any event. He is one of the best person to work with. We have lots of things in common which starts from the TV series we watch (and then discuss about every episode in detail) to the events in which we get involved. Ideally the only person who will buy all t-shirt no matter how it is. He will say li8 more number of times than over 50% of BITS people put together. But very genuine person always ready to help. If you need any help specially during night hours go directly to him because most of the time you will find him awake for entire night. When it comes to Acads he is the most intelligent and sincere from entire ME. It was fun to take MUP labs with you and your company had made it legen(wait for it) dary.........!! 
Hope you have a great future ahead.......
ALL THE BEST..........!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-peshwe">Paritosh Peshwe</a></p>
