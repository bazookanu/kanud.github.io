<h1 class="page-title">Dhruva T B</h1><p>THE most brilliant guy I know. In my opinion the 'most likely to be most likely' person of our batch. I am in complete awe of his technical knowledge & grasping abilities and am infinitely grateful to him  for deigning to help me get through countless exams of countless subjects. Here's to TB, a fucking genius.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>TB! This brilliant 9p is the coolest Telegu dude I know, though that's not saying much. Exam times in 3-1 invariably had me knocking at his doorstep. Armed with a smile on my face and a book in my hand, it would boil down to a race, wherin he would try and shut the door on me and I would try and dash in. Anyway, he's the reason I passed many of my courses, and his patience is legendary - I mean if he can teach a guy with the attention span of a bu... he's an avid gamer and fellow fry and laurie fan. We did plan to con the world once, after seeing a particularly eye-opening episode of The Real Hustle, but I doubt we'll ever get down to it. This genius will achieve graet heights yadayada but he'll still refuse to share his pizza. bastard. congrats on gsoc, and may you live long and prosper. cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Dhruva is an old friend and an amazing guy. I first met him in 11th at FIITJEE but really got to know him well after we came to BITS. He's an exceptional talent, very intelligent and one of the best engineers who'll come out of BITS Goa. He's got a fantastic sense humour, he has mastered the art of sarcasm and there's never a dull moment when he's around. It's very nice talking to me as he always comes across as a perfect gentleman. Very courteous, very helpful.. Dhruva is an awesome friend to have. He has brilliant taste in music and knows a lot about movies and gaming. He's into so many things, it's bizzare how he's managed to do so well in acads. Hats off! All the best :) I'm sure you're going to do many wonderful things in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>A sheer Genius Dhruva is one of my closest friends on campus. His intelligence is exceptionally great and he is too good at acads hence a proud 9p, not one of those sitting for hours in library and mugging up stuff( in fact i've never seen him go to the library :P) but the one who applies his brains and logic to everything he does. His enthusiasm and dedication for coding and computer sciences is unparalleled so much so that he used to attend Comp Sc CDC's along with his ENI ones (which is surely not an easy thing). He is a dedicated gamer and his knowledge in this field  is commendable. He knows a lot about movies and TV shows and has been providing me with a list of great movies whenever i felt the need. He is damn crazy when it comes to watching movies. I will never forget that he had gone to Panjim to watch IronMan2 during our Compre exams( that was seriously a daring thing to do ). The best quality about him which makes him stand apart in the crowd is his sarcasm and jokes. He can take your case in so many ways you cant even imagine and his on the spot answers and replies leave you speechless. It is seriously great fun to be in his company. At the same time his humbleness and calmness is also truly admirable and i've never seen him lose his calm for any reason. He has helped me numerous times in college and has never said "NO" for anything i have asked him. Thanks for being an amazing friend all these years and you have been truly an inspiration for me. You will surely achieve great heights in your life. Best Wishes for the future. Live Long and Prosper \\ //<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Fellow TV Shows fan, Brit-humor lover, Fry and Laurie addict, and film buff. Oh, and an absolute fucking genius. TB's done it all, with truckloads of sarcasm and an insane sense of humor. I met TB via Neil, the two quiet Dhruvas - misanthropes and introverts. But I was lucky to get to know Dhruva better, 'cause he's one of the smartest and most brilliant people I've come across. A classic tall brooding hero, TB's mostly famous for standing calmly, hands in pocket, as he proceeds to skin the other person with a rollercoaster of hilarious albeit biting sarcastic comment upon comment. Its so much fun to see him bitching about professors, other students, and people in general. But still, he's one of the  most kind and helpful people I've met, tolerating all us folks in his room,as he's explained all those subjects. Be it the Bogmalo trips, or watching QI, talking about books, intelligent cinema , conversations with TB have always been great fun. Here's to all the fun at Goa, the Silicon Valley job,and all the success you so rightly deserve. You're truly the Itachi amongst us all. =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Dhruva is this introvert, subtle person in a loud world, the (Evil) genius of our batch! (Even Genius should have a Superlative degree - & if there is, I am sure you'd know it!). There are a few people whom I know that have this sharp wit and sarcasm, and (un)fortunately, I have been the victim on more than one occasion. He is the most knowledgeable person I know, one who attends CS as well as ENI CDC's (might have even attended a few Mech CDC's as well..who knows!) - which is the craziest trait you can have in an Engineer. The saviour of my CDC year - really man, couldnt have done it without your help. You certainly are one of the smartest person I know on campus. The enigma you bring into the room is incredibly rejuvenating. Some epic moments have been shared by Neil, Sahil, him & me - particularly the one evening in mess, where we spent 20 mins discussing names of strippers whose names started from from A to Z. :P The wizard alongside whom I am fortunate enough to become a fellow GSoC-er. Finally, a true gentleman!
Really man, it was an honour to have known you. I wish you the best in life and I know you will fulfill all your ambitions - your success in life is inevitable!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
<p>First and foremost, thanks for all the millions and zillions of exams you have helped me get through. Without that I doubt where the fuck would i be, seriously. And not only exams this guy has stuck around for all the assignments ranging form the bonus ones to the anti-bonuses and others which ENI students are deemed worthy of being burdened with. These have been a lifesaver and the countless grades of mine which have stayed afloat are all thanks to TBD.
Calm and patient this guy has seen almost every TV series, anime et all that has ever populated the mortal world. And yet one of the rare guys I found who shares the same liking for linux. Loves python, hates a few others, but this guy is serious about programming. Right from the dedication he invokes for a casual programming to GSOC project, this guy loves it.

Has been fun having you around. You shall be missed. 

Live longa nd prosper _\\//_<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhaavan-merchant">Bhaavan Merchant</a></p>
