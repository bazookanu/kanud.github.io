<h1 class="page-title">Disha Pramod Gujar</h1><p>One of the few people whom I have always seen with a smile on their face. Hard working, intelligent, smart confident ( of course , she's a 9p :P) and good at almost everything as far as i know her. And a very good basketball player too. Helping, Caring, Straight-forward and she's different from others in a lot of ways. That's what i like about my Deedee :P ( and now she knows who I am :D )  Have enjoyed being with her, spending time with her, however less it was. Thank you Deedee. Keep Smiling the same way always. And u'll go places, m sure !  And remember me once in a while. :)
 
Wishing her all the very best in life ahead.  And ye padh ke kabhi kabhi yaad kar liya karna isi bahane :P   :))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Don't know when we became friends (Which exactly shows how friendly she is), she is one of the few 'all rounder' girls in campus. Excellent in studies (A consistent 9p), she is also the basketball team captain and has been involved in numerous activities in the campus. She enjoys life like no other. She is like the 'gel' of ENI, keeping everyone together. She helps everyone with a smile (her notes and assignment have a huge demand!). Don't know what half the batch would do without her. Hope she reaches greater heights, always has her cute smile. Best of Luck!!...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Dishaaa... We've been in the same corridoor for three years but we became friends in the 3rd year only, thanks to ENI. All your notes thanks to which i managed to scrape through all the exams! And all the boring lectures which we couldn't have got through without all the gossips! You made my ENI much more interesting !! You're one intelligent girl who talks a lot but that's why it's so much fun being with you. Keep in touch. All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Disha, now i got to know this eni phodu in the 3rd year and i must say i was pleasantly surprised!! Before the eni cdc's i only knew her as the girl who had topped cp1 and through her sisterhood of her closely knit group of friends. I discovered many facets of her life , thanks to the eni cdc's we attended together. She is really sharp, if something is of interest to her she can conjure up levels of concentrations i can only imagine. She's also a terrific basketball player. Her sincerity towards things she like is admirable.She's also a real fun person to hang out with. You can't get bored in her company. You can very frequently see a   kid in her by the way she talks, gets excited or nervous over small things ( don't change that). It's been a great pleasure knowing you. Hope we meet again sometime in the future( where you will be some hotshot in a semiconductor firm speaking stuff that is all greek to me ). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>

<p>Got to know Disha really well during PS1 in Kalpakkam. At the first glance Disha appears to be this extremely studious, diligent intellectual (normally seen with a backpack, big enough to have all those heavy books mentioned to fill space in course handouts ). While this is true, she is also this extremely cheerful, fun loving, talkative sportsperson. She has the most efficient time management skills I've ever seen. A CDC is year is quite demanding by itself; add to it a project, an elective of the likes of ADVD, a PA ship, CL classes, captaining the college's basket ball team..(and still doing very well in academics), this is the level of brilliance I am talking about. 
While doing all this, she still carves out time for friends. The extraordinary care she takes to be in touch with all the friends from PS in highly admirable. I had the most amazing summer with her in PS1. Here's wishing her the best of luck for the future, Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>

<p>It was my first day on campus and I was busy setting up my new room with all my stuffs in it when I heard a voice which sounded distinctly similar to a friend of mine back from school. I hurried out of the room in the hope to find her and that was how I met Dish whose name has transformed from Disha to Dishe, Dish, Dishkyaao and god knows what else by the end of these three years :P  We got chatty while waiting for our turn to get registered for the sem courses (Our priority numbers were consecutive 234 and 235) and she was fun to talk to. Till that day I was under the impression that I was the one who spoke a lot but having met Disha I knew that there was someone better than me at doing the talking. So then on I carefully chose the role of a listener for Disha. She is this sweet Gujju girl who will speak in a miscellaneous language and by that I mean she will mix up words from different languages into Hindi and that will just be unique for her. Dish talks about her family members as though we already knew her family members from our childhood and then after she has finished telling about them we will all be like “Who is he?” and then she’ll tell us the actual connection. I still remember in the first year we both had all classes in common and how she was sad that she did not get the same section as mine in Thermo (which later turned out in her favor though). Sweet as she is, she always ended up putting my proxy in Physics-1 classes which I religiously bunked. Thanks to her for that…atleast I managed a C cz of the attendance marks ;) Anyway but while sitting in classes with her I realized how intelligent and smart she is. She is very dedicated to the work that she is engaged in. A steady 9p Disha is not to be mistaken for a nerd. Instead she manages her time pretty well and I believe it is one good thing to learn from her. She is a great basketball player…one of the few amazing ones I have actually met in my life,and managing an extra-curricular activity with acads and even then maintaining grades is a daunting task….hats off to her!! She does it all so well. Dish or Disheee (as AVK named her and I very fondly call her sometimes) is a total kid at heart although she can be really mature at times. It has always been fun hanging around with her, be it on our trips to Cavelossim and Baga during the India fests, Arambol, Palolem or in the hostel watching horror movies and Vampire Diaries together. She totally gets absorbed in the TV series that she watches especially Vampire Diaries and Pretty Little Liars (she’ll actually scream in the incident of a shocking scene). Dish gets very emotional and senti at times (remember Kinu’s birthday few days back). Not that it’s a bad thing at all, it just shows how attached she is to people. And talking of attachment that comes pretty rapidly for this girl who always has a smiling face and never fails to charm people around her. Even during her two months at PS-1 she got so attached to her PS mates that she was upset about having to leave them. This is what allows her to basically keep in touch with everyone even the most far off friends, she' ll manage to talk to all of them and keep up with their lives. Have to admit that she has a unique quality which enables her to make place for herself in everyone’s heart. We both being highly opinionated people always have had a difference in our view points…that leads to petty arguments but then friends fight and even then stay together don’t  they? She is a true Libran, supposed to be a hopeless romantic like we used to tell her when she did not pretty much like the idea of having a boyfriend or liking someone…but then these three years have totally transformed her and now one can quite obviously see the change in her I suppose ;) A girl with a very pure heart who cannot see the bad in anyone at all…we say she has a halo on her which makes her see only the good in people. Now, I don’t want to pen down the usual stuffs like caring helpful blah blah!! That’s not for us to write Dish…instead I’ll write about the fact that you hate girly stuffs like nail colors and make ups and not to forget my long nails ;) hehe…. Having said all of this I’ll say that this girl with a bubbly personality has always been a good friend over the three years in BITS….and will always continue to remain one for me for the rest of my life… It’s not yet time for me to bid a good bye to her cz we’ll still have ample time during our internship over the summers…Nevertheless I’d like to wish her all the very best for her future…I am sure she’ll do great things out there in the world…Cheers to our friendship…Thank you for making these three years in BITS a memorable time of my life. Lots of Love.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Dishiiii… My first impression of her was “God she talks a lot." The first time we had met I already knew a whole lot about her. And it did not take us long to become friends. Disha is a funny, bubbly person with a whole lot of interests. She plays basketball (the whole college knows that), she writes, she draws, she dances, she writes beautiful poetry and also is one of the smartest persons I have known. Apart from the fact that she confuses dinner with lunch and lunch with dinner, she might just ask you to go for breakfast with her at 5 in the evening or she might say “Good evening” at 8 in the morning or “Good afternoon” at 7 in the evening… that’s Disha, the person who cares wholeheartedly for her friends. She is the brave one to drive out the lizards in our rooms. She is our peacemaker… resolves fights (tries to) and brings everyone together… She can make friends anywhere and everywhere… age no bar!!! From the shopkeeper in Kalpakkam to her teacher’s daughter, she can mingle with anyone. If you are sad she will try her best to cheer you up, every time she comes to know about something new that everybody ought to know, she will mass message and make sure nobody remains uninformed, if she sees a pigeon in the hostel she will go feed it (even if she is scared of it)… she is emotional (over- senti sometimes :P)… she loves her friends and family terribly… Out of her busy schedule she finds time to make a wall-hanging for her friend on her birthday… she is a darling… she would never let a friend have a meal alone in the mess… she is childishly loveable, loving and caring, overly talkative and a complete extrovert.. Remain like this Disha, it would have been a very long time b4 I forget all those times we have laughed and cried together… Loads and loads of love and good wishes  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nisheeta-desai">Nisheeta Desai</a></p>

<p>disha... is so smart , outing , chirpy and so adorable . always talking about something or other very focused and give everything she does the best, It was so  amazing  to do CAS and MUP with you , really changed us being acquaintances from first year to good friends. All those gossip sessions evening bitching ...wow that was so enjoyable ! One thing i cannot forget is watching REC2 ! the horror  movie was turned into a real time comedy thanks to your endless screaming , the only thing i was scared of was losing my ear drums :P You are such an entertainment package ! keep smiling and success no doubt will be yours ! I so cant wait to hear from you that you have collected almost all the letters in english alphabet series by rocking the world of MS admits from the east to the west ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>
<p>Hiee sidey… tere bare mein kya kahoon?? Tu to khuli kitaab hai….jitna tu bolti hai, how’s it possible ki kisi to tere bare mein kuch nhi pata hoga??? I first met disha in SAC, right behind me in the queue of room allocations…that’s how we ended up being sideys. After that she came to my room discussing about all the subjects and the teachers and multi-section courses and blah blah blah, of which I hardly understood a word, after which she dragged me with her to ch-4 for books and advice(remember how scared we were about getting ragged  :P)..and aise hi saath mein rehte rehte we became great friends…I’ve had so many fun times with her…the first out-of-campus trip (vo bhi poora 1 sem khatam hone ke baad, we were so silly!!), palolem, colva pe water scooter ki rides, bogmalo, etc etc. If disha happens to go with you to a restaurant, it’s hilarious…firstly, she’s a veg, that too not a proper veg also, paneer nahi khati, pehle to mushroom bhi nhi khati thi, and plus soft drinks peene ke baad she becomes like a bubbling device :P :P and u can’t stop laughing once that happens because her face become all cute and she looks like a kitten trapped somewhere.. : P: P. She’s the perfect mommy and daddy’s girl, very very attached to her family and all her friends. I don’t know how she manages to keep in touch with so many old connections but it’s really remarkable. And she manages her time really well, with the n number of tasks she does. An awesome basketball player but a terrible singer who mixes up actual lyrics of a song with something made up of her own :P :P . One has to be beware of her rabbit ears…it’s hard to keep a secret around her, she’ll hear u even when u whisper!!! There’s a danger that she will forget your birthday if she’s busy watching a match… she forgot mine :( :( , so u’ll have to keep reminding her. She’s one hell of a cleanliness freak, with the most spic nd span room you will find in the entire hostel, that’s y she reminds me so much of Monica from FRIENDS(:P)…Disha is my scream buddy, jab bhi horror movie dekhte hai, we are the only two people who scream the most and disturb the entire corridor :D :D. These three years have been great with you disha..always be the way you are right now… :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-aggarwal">Megha Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>Disha, dish, disheee, Dish TV and my oppi! One of the bubbliest people I know, her non-stop chapar-chapar keeps our entire corridor alive :P A bit of a tomboy (though I doubt she'll admit it) she is always game for anything.Pata nahi itni energy hamesha kahan se lati hai! Quite great at time management I must say-acads, basketball, dojma work etc etc- always managed eevrything so easily. And does she LOVE to talk!! You just have to get her started and then she won't stop :P She'll talk to anyone and everyone, and will even make strangers feel like she's known them all their lives. She mixes up some funny little things, like lunch ko dinner bolna and dinner ko lunch, and yello is pink for hr and pink is yellow :P :P has very weird sleeping habits. "mujhe paanch minute mein uthana" is what we get to hear from her very often. staying opposite to her have spent most of my three years in BITS with her. It has been awesome fun! teri bak-bak ke bina toh hum sab bore hi ho jate yaar :P
Love you Dish :) All the best! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreya-kedia">Shreya Kedia</a></p>
