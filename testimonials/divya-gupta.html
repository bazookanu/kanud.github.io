Divya as a person is extremely honest with a great heart!.Has fantastic  looks!  With a determination like hers i dont think any problem will stand a chance against her...! The amount of hardwork she puts in even the GODS will respect her for that!... Extremely helpful &  always der to solve any doubt, any subj!... she smiles (even with so much tension. :)  ).. ., She has one of those pleasant & great smiles which are just too infectious! .....Hope you JUst ENjoy life to the fullest, & Keep Smiling !Success toh vaise bhi is Guaranteed! ..let the fun continue  :)) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-ramesh-maheshwari">Rachit Ramesh Maheshwari</a></p>
<p>Beauty with Brains!! This is what Divya is all about....be it her looks or her acads.....she excels in both :) She is a total chilled out person and it is always fun talking to her. She is one of those few people on this campus with whom i can be completely frank and free! She does not carry that girlie 'nakhras' and is a very straight forward person.  Had it not been for her, I dunno how i would have coped up with Eco CDC's......her class notes ( which we call 'DG Notes' pyaar se :P) are the life-line for my survival in BITS ( thoda jaada filmy hogaya :P) She also has a humorous way of talking hindi where she doesn't care about the gender of the person :P ( like "mai kya karta" instead of "mai kya karti" :P) She is very helpful and explains everything nicely with examples (for eg. 'Demerit' goods ;) :P) To sum it up, Divya is a complete package of fun,entertainment,nautanki,beauty and one of my best buddies in Campus. Always be as awesome as you are :) Always stay in touch! Wish u all the best for future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>The next wiki leak will be divya's  timetable iam eagerly waiting for it :P.You were the first girl i talked to in BITS , remember those EG days , they  were  horrible, i still remember the way we struggled to get solutions for those 3d views :P. You never looked back after that ,kept on adding 'A' into your account , i dont think any one in BITS is as to committed to acads as you are  But then you manage time for your frds .You r the best person to ask last min doubts. Keep working the same way no matter wat ppl say , you will definitely reach gr8 heights , all the very best for ur future :)))) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-jaini">Aditya Jaini</a></p>
<p>Hmmm....I admit that I can write a book on you. No one knows Divya better than me in the campus. That's an open challenge. I have seen her evolve to what she is today and been there with her. I met her first as a part of my TRW group, and we know each other so much better after that. I admit that she is very-hardworking and she has made her way to the top. Many a times I have coaxed her into doing things that she didn't liked, but she even did that. I really respect you for this. Now, she has a very affectionate style of speaking which just got me. Everything is so perfect with her. Now so much for the good part. Now comes the fun. We have never left a chance to make fun of each other at any point of time. Its kind of a ritual between us. I can talk to her just about anything. Our talks are so random. Also, for the news of it, only one week back she came to know that Osama is dead. Thank god!! I have seen taking out her time for me. I really appreciate that. I don't remember a time we weren't together in last 1.5 years. Let it be that way. And please lend me your notes next year. You know, you have made me a better person. I have moved out of my science punches, just because of you. There are so many things to say, but I am winding up now. Actually there is no point in writing this, because we'll always be together. We both know this. Best of luck for whatever you want to achieve...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>Divya! One of the first couple of friends i made in college. Used to be a chilled out person, then she realised that it is important to study and do well and with this determination, she strived and whoa! There she is, breezing to the top of every course, leaving the others far behind! I'm awed at how she manages to do it! I don't think she ever goes for an exam unprepared or with a part of the syllabus not done. She is a very hardworking and helpful person and I'm sure she'll do well in life. I've had the privilege of being to her house in Jaipur and she played the perfect host. Thank for that! Do keep in touch and All the best!! :) Tanmaya<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tanmaya-sanghvi">Tanmaya Sanghvi</a></p>

<p>Here's one testimonial which I really wanted to write....Divya :)....the most honest and straight-forward person whose existence I was aware of but whom I really came to know through our CDCs....and I am glad I did get to know you....perseverance and hard work personified....she knows what she has to do and does it (that's very difficult)....phodofying all the subjects - it's easy to say, but the amount of hard work behind it is awesome !!!....has a child-like personality :D ....says what she wants, does what she wants, asks insane amount of doubts in class ..(so much so that the class feels eerily quiet if she's absent! )....can be awesomely funny when she wants to :D ....stay the same (take a few breaks beech-me..:) )...cheers!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-repal">Neha Repal</a></p>
