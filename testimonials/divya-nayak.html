<h1 class="page-title">Divya Nayak</h1><p>Yo DN !!

Heard of the term "Beauty with Brains"?? Divya is an apt example of the phrase.When it comes to studies,she just aces her courses and same is the case with her elegance and grace,one can easily distinguish her beauty from rest of the pack.As a friend she is awesome,never lets you down,for every small problem she will put in a sweet query-"Baks! Why so sad ?? Cheer up" and ensure the next time the frown doesn't come to my face.A caring friend like her very difficult to find by, and I will definitely miss her company once I am out of here.Always stay in touch( I wont leave you with another option :P ),keep the wonderful smile of yours up and success is bound to embrace you. :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>Divya " amu " , the best girl I ever met in my lyf.
Whether I talk about her beauty or behaviour or brain , everythin is outstanding.
I got to know her during Waves winter'09. The first thing I noticed was her simplicity.
She did a great work as an Info Management member.
She's a person who'll always ready to help her friends in any situation.
She's a very charming and intelligent. Her honesty & sincerity is unmatchable.
The way She managed her studies and social lyf is briliant. She's a perfect example of beauty with brain.
She always keep enjoying her lyf except the 15 days during exams. ( OmG.. No one can match the height of your tension ;) )

She always try to hide her tension but hardly she succeeds. :P
She's very hard working and her results in last 2 semesters prove this ( 9.4 & 9.6 :P.. Gajab Phoda hai ; )


Your presence is irreplacable.:-*

Wishing you all the best for your future :-* ( Phodte raho ;)
Prakat to bohot kuch krna chahta tha
but Itna hi theek h jagah ko dekhte hue
:P

<p>Divyaaaaa!! Well, how to start! I have sooo much to say that i cant figure out what to say first. I'll start from the start. 1-1 was a very different experience for me. With an entirely different group and perspective. All we thought of doing was studying. We used to sit in library the whole day and i just can't believe that only once we went out of campus the entire sem :O which is quite hard to digest, now that we go out every other day :P but whatever it may be, you are one person who has truly been with me the entire time on this campus. Our nesci trips(:P) where no one used to come but the two of us were  always there everyday, without fail :P and then the changeover happened, when we met Anjali, Tapsi, Bharti, Nikhita, Neha :) and then, out college life begun all over again with a fresh start!! It was filled with sooooo much fun, infinite outings, gossiping about every damn stupid thing, naming each n every individual on this campus :P and not to miss, you are the person who brought the "DJ Revolution" in our group :P with your out of the world pjs and totaly mindblowing logics understanding which took me 3yrs and now finally i can understand them without help :P but however deadly they were starting from "my name is khan" or "rancho", they always made me laugh :D even when you are sad or frustrated, ur totaly lively and jolly nature makes you forget all that :) but haan, one thing tu har choti baat pe roti boht hai :P but you should know this, that you are going to be a very successful person as you are so determined and hard working and m sure you'll get what you want in life :) Just by the look at my face, you get to know what m thinking and its unbelievable how much you understand me. You have always been there with me in every possible situation, whether happy or sad. N i say that everytime, i am going to say again that you are one of the most beautiful girls i have ever met and this is not just because you are my frnd and so il just say this to make you happy, but this is the truth with no bias. I am going to miss you soooo much, you have no idea. You are an amazing person, so caring and a true frnd who is always by your side no matter what the situation is. I wish you all the very best in life and may all your wishes come true. Always keep that beautiful smile on your face. Love you a lottt !! :):*****<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Hmm ...Divya ..!!  Yaar aap bade mast hai ;) ...  The happiest person on earth when she is happy and the saddest one when she is sad ..!!  I got to know you through the many common frnz we had . I saw you for the first time in BIJIL sirs Maths class .  You sat on the first bench and wud start asking doubts right from the moment you wud enter the class  and the whole class got irritated and cursed you .. Oh yes  # facts  .. :P  .  Nevertheless  as the time passed , i found you very interesting to talk to but my findings were shattered when i literally interacted with you and you cracked one of your DJ's  (its DIVYA JOKES) :P .. You were so happy after cracking it , that you took out your hand expecting me to clap it .. while I was busy staring at you admiring your intelligence ..  :P . But today after three years of tolerance , I expect you to crack at least one everytime i meet you .. maza ni aata warna ;) ..  Very good girl by nature , wants her frnz to be happy at all times and supports them when needed . Also the things which I need not elaborate on is your sincerity , honesty , and  giving u r best shot to every situation . you are one of the best in this department . Also , Divya likes to be a part of photographs . Your photographs were \m/ which were clicked by me  :D ... One thing I would like to say about you is that you are very cute and dont underestimate yourself as you always do and now to you have pics with more than 100's of likes  ;) .Be the person you are always .. I cant imagine you even a bit changed you are right now .. one of the most frndly persons i know .. be the gem you are ..  :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>

<p>Divyaa..!! Its hardest to describe her..cause she's soo dynamic..!! One moment she would be giving you high fives on everything and the other cribbbing about marks..but thats what is so admirable about her..in simple words..she is "life", living nd displaying each emotion as it comes..a very perfect mixture of sweetness and smartness..you can never get bored in her company..!! I still remember how we became close sharing n no of classes starting with physics, and a major role was played by our identical liking("sam, do chai!! " :P)  Since then,I have really enjoyed sharing chemical classes, labs,etc etc. Divya, just wanted to say that,although we have had weird ups and downs in our friendship( and somehow we always come out of then unscratched, I love us for that..!!) I have some of the greatest memories with you..running for the class, one of us goes "chod na yaar lite lete hai" and then cribbing coz tabhi test hua..having thrown out of class by kicchu..to the awsummm moments in lab..the late nite cribbing about assignments...or the laughs we shared in mass transfer and pc classes..A very good friend, she's always there for you and u can trust her even for the odd moments, coz she looks at the larger picture..And people no matter how she cries, trust me,its just the purity of her heart thats being reflected..She's very dedicated to whatever she does, and shes just so frank and with such low expectations, that her success sometimes comes as a shock to her..and although its really hard to get it, but the pain is really worth knowing one of the awsumest prsonality..!!  I really love you for comforting me when i needed someone..somehow even when we dont discuss our daily errands, we have shared our thoughts,our tensions and fears with each other..Seriously people, shes a friend to keep, coz she'll always be there in need.. Divya, thanks for being what you are,..coz i was never able to tell you how much it means to just see u in classes and corridor, to always have that one person who will ask you "kaisi hai" irrespective of our misunderstandings, and to brighten up with that awsum smile and mindblowing jokes..just Love you yaar..!!! I know you have a bright future ahead..so All the best..!! Just be your charming self..smiling and fighting all the challenges..!! Love you yaar..!! :* :) hope you achieve all that u desire from life..!! :) :)

<p>Divya Nayak…this girl is awesome fun…I remember the frst time I saw her..with that tensed face when she came here, late for the registration.. :P :P From just being an acquaintance, we turned into ‘hi’ and ‘hello’ type friends…and then came this sem..which changed everything..i don’t know when I came so close to her…but whatever it was…this has been tooooo good… :D :D divya is very sincere, understanding and too caring…she will listen to all your problems with utmost patience…she has the quality of handling the worst situations with ease.. :) :) Everything is set straight in her head…what she wants from her life and does every possible thing she can to achieve her goals….!!! Apart from this she is very straightforward…the best trait in her…will tell you what she actually feels about everything around her.. ‘fake’ is not any word in her dictionary…. :D :D now coming to the fun part…ye hume boht pakaati hai apne gande gande jokes se(though I love them at times.. :P :P)…and she has taught everyone else including Anjali n ishita to do the same… boht roti hai…the “cry-baby” :P :P and the funniest part is that we console her when we ourselves are in the worse situation.. :P :P , has an obsession with likes on her DP’s on facebook.. !!!! :P divyaa…I love you….everything about you shall be misseddd.. :(  your Thailand, roz subah hume batana ki aaj humne kaunsa test miss kiya.. :P , your animated expressions,  you shouting  from your room when we are making noise while you are sleeping..:P  and the way you imitate me..!! :( :( all the best divyaaaa…stay in touch ALWAYSS..!!! :D :D :-* :-* now this one’s for you : “Yoooooo mannn..!!!” :P :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bharti-chhabra">Bharti Chhabra</a></p>
<p>divyaaa..My best branch buddy!..I knew her since the first semester but back then for me she was a padhakoo only and only talking about marks,c.g all the time.Our interaction was not more than the frequent hi's and bye's.Truly speaking we became buddies in 3-1(chemical ke dukh dard mein saathi :P).I will miss all our mongi breaks only for your tea(MISS CHAi.. OMG!!!.. she has so much tea/coffee in her system),making fun of each other,our special comments in between lectures,sending messages when not sitting together,she is the one who can understand all my non verbal cues(ishaare),who motivated me when i was upset regarding marks or project( tough she ws 100% more tensed and anxious regarding the same ..than i was)..also she is the queen of MATCHING earrings...thats why never has she reached a class on time.. ;-) ..will always remember kaise har exam mein in exam hall so cutely with all the tension she used to say "yaar mere aage baith ja..." looking forward to one more semester and hopefully PS2 wid you!!!!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-jain">sakshi jain</a></p>

<p>The look i get when i turn back to see you in the class; we gossiping 
about each and every person who pass by(didn't even leave that xerox girl 
in vasco:D);  time spent in the labs doing nothing but chatting; your 
"mera kya hoga yaar" dialogue after exams; combined cribbing about 
marks and preparation;  after class monginis walks; that fab chemical trip;
our walks after dinner in sem1..........this list is endless. Each and every 
moment spent with you will be cherished. I had the BEST time with you
"cutie cry baby":P. Can't believe that there are only few days left out.
Damn Divya!! Why can't you stay for one more sem?:X (sounds stupid, but
i really want you to). Will miss all the "awesome"st fun i had with you. 
All the very best for everything!! :)  Bitch!!stay in touch. Any time you

Love you!!

<p>Yo man !

The customary greeting from Divya has been a constant throughout last two years :) A sensible and girl whose beauty and intelligence defines her. Most of the write ups do talk about her transformation from a Madrasan to the Dhinchak dudette out there. However, the way she values people has not changed. Bahut badi tension queen hai but manages to pull off her acads exceedingly well.

Our innumerable outings, craze for doog food, and mast hai na dialogues, Bakku jokes, campus talks, and facebook likes, Anant Ashram incidents, listening to ne and Dude narrating our legendary train tales, interpreting Bakpal's nonsense, Big Guy's cuttttttee :| , idiotic discussions, arguements over random people, Africa ke tatvartiye kshetra ke log, intentional poking Dude, mera kuch nahin hoga, aapka set hai, pics and what not will be cherished forever. Most of our outings have been due to your pleasant company that invaribaly completes the group along with me obviously :P

I salute you for the committment and respect for relations in life. Kabhi kabhi bahut democratic ho jati ho but hopefully you will transform over the time and be better for whatever littlle scope of betterment remains there.You will go places in your personal and professional life for sure. Satya Vachan hai yeh :D   Thanks for being a amazing sis here in campus :) 

And yeah the Benetton watch is Goood man :P
