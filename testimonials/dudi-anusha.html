<p>anuuuu..She is one beautiful girl with a soft and sweet voice who does not care about what others think or what they follow and thats what makes her stand out among the rest. Our beloved hostel rep has a great personality and rocks in whatever she likes!She was in the college basket ball team and an active member of DORAH and DR10D.In these 3 years of bits life we had some great collection of memories. We share our birthday and that probably is what makes her my special friend. I remember your birthday gift in 2nd year and the expression on your face when you first saw it! Priceless!The days we spent together in our rooms when u were frightened by my scary eyes are moments worth cherishing. You have a lot of patience and your determination will take you to heights you would want to achieve. Be the same as you are and do stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
<p>Dudi!!!well the name says it all…she is actually “Dude” kinda girl ;) :P……hey do u remember the 1st we met??!!hahha…funny wasn’t it….well it was outside A-mess…there were around 10-12 senior boys interacting(==ragging :D) with just anu,, vydehi and me….that horrified childish look on her face…hahha…tat was one funny moment.
Dudi is one of the most extroverted girl I’ve seen…she is friends with many people…she is kind, cool, pure at heart, funny, too straightforward (ouch!!Some tyms it hurts…but it’s ok dudi u always stay lyk tat), childish, intelligent, determined. In my 1st year I used to think she’s “bommarillu” genelia kinds :P :P. She loves her mother and bro a lot!!!She was gifted a guitar by her bro on one of her b’days…seriously u gotta start learning it now.
She’s a really good basketball player and physically fit…aarrggh >.< she takes advantage over me and hits me and punches me all the tym >.<. (navvatam aapu inka)
Dudi is one person whom I would always ask for any suggestion, for it to be unbiased and practical. She’s one girl with whom I feel close and comfortable to talk with, even though we rarely get time to talk these days. She keeps making fun of me all the time…considering the “IS” factor or whatever else it myt be. The lake trip which we went on recently can never be forgotten…it was nice.
Dudi I promise you that,the bike trip which we’ve been planning since many days will surely come into existence atleast in the next semester.
I hope the best for you..keep smiling as always…and stay in touch lekapothe champestha.

<p>anusha : my.. the best 4nd with whom i spent all my 

days in BITS. we were never apart. she is dynamic, 

charismatic, very strong will powered,energetic, g0-

head, glorious, straight forward , trustiness, honest, 

sincere ..she is very matured gal and she knows abt her 

the best.she is a Very good player in colg basketball 

team (:P) . Some times she laughs like hell without 

reason and very childish and crazy during this hyper 

active state. I cant forget the days we spent roaming 

around campus having funny ,stupid and point less 

discussions. I always study in her room though we didnt 

hav common subjects...in short I can say her room is my 

studyroom. do u remember dudi.. you left me alone and 

went to movie when i was having xam..i can say that  

was one of  horrible situations i ever felt...i called 

u many times that day ....can't  even stay alone 

without you for even for few hours ...And the other 

situation is when u went to bogmalo ...the hard 

situations when u left me alone in hostel ..she is very 

good at making maggi and cooking .the days when u 

cooked rice for me and saved me from dying of hunger. A 

very good photographer .Almost all my dp's are your 

talent .i wanna uplaod that pic in fb but the stupid 

fellow(we all know who he is but dnt want to mention 

here) will die after seeing it ... We have many common 

habits may be that made us closer ..we both hate 

waiting ...i know how u get irritted when sm1 makes you 

wait ...Haha and most excited situation is when you 

missed you SATCOM test2 ..When we were worrying abt 

this she was convincing us ..and i know you are 

Prof.NITIN SHARMA s best student and he will go you 

make up for sure.

And forgot to mention abt our tirupati trip ( :) )  

where weee in Q for hours together without you and 

harika i might hv dead in that stupid Q.. you such a 

good company didnt get bored though stayed in Q for  

hours together  its becoz of u dudi :( . 

 Recently have seen a new angle in you ..when you were 

lookin at no na..staring at (not to mention). :P and blusing to the comments 

of chetana .. :hahaha  ... 

Thank you somuch for baring me and  my stupid comments on evry one.. 

thanks for changes u did in my testi i hought you wont ..but thank god finally u did ..otherwise im screwd.

 i learnt manythings from you dudi. :) She has very 

 clear idea of her future.Her strong will-power surely 

adds to her goals and have a very bright future. dudi

<p>Anusha...!!! One of my first friends that I made in Bits..!! I remember in the first year.. you, me and my mom sitting in the mess.. and how you asked her to accompany her to shopco.. I was just so amazed.. at the helping hand you extended...!! An amazing person who is soooo good at heart...!! A girl who has heart of gold and would always be ready to help you without an itch..! :D Superb basket ball player, friendly, confident, honest and trustworthy, frank, ..!! This defines her..!! :) She is very pretty with such a sweet voice... The way in which she speaks will enthrall you and you would want to keep listening to her and that mesmerizing voice ...!! :D  This girl values friendship a lot... and has all good values imbibed in her...!! I wish you all the very best for future and I know you are going to scale the heights of success because you deserve it..!! :D :-* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>
<p>First girl I met on campus was Anusha.... she is soo good... we exchanged our numbers.. and then the journey began...  Extremely Soft-spoken, very honest, reserved and yet so close... Anusha is a darling, be it for her friends, mother or brother... she loves physics like hell... our hostel representative has done a great lot of works, because of her we won Zephyr and Slam..was in college basketball team... living next to such a person is an achievement in itself... ( :P).. I have never seen her getting angry, she knows how to take decisions ... loved ur brother’s gift.. (guitar..) hope you learn it after coming from ps and play something for me.. :D ... I personally like her personality a lot.. independent, strong, no-nonsense attitude and happy-go-lucky... seriously I never realized time but flew away so fast... i just love your mom (and ob, even u..), she is so caring...I remember during my fast, she got fruits for me... Loves watching movies and her taste in music is really great... I feel sorry for her sometimes, when I keep on talking and she listens to me patiently.. but once she is in her form.. no one can beat her.. ( :P)...   Be in touch... and  all the best... take care.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>Anushaaa.... Atlast!!! Here's my testimonial for u :P You are such an important person in my life. My life at BITS is incomplete widout u. How can I ever forget the fun we had together in these 2 years.. I always wonder how could two people have so many things in common ( from all our course sections since 2nd yr to the mobiles we use.. :D ) though some good qualities of yours miss in me ;) Seriously, I have got to learn a lot from u.. especially taking 'lite' when required..  You do things so perfectly, the best example is that u get full marks if u attempt the question nd none if u don't (most of the times...).. you being my friend is one of the (very few) reasons I feel happy for coming to goa... I feel very bored nd lonely if u don't attend some cls :(  I wud never forget ur tr8 @ bogmalo..dat was an awesome evng.. 
You have a lot of energy.. u r dynamic, strong, independent, always smiling... nd lend me some of ur energy :P ;)  omg!!!do u really love physics??? I have never known that!! :P  
We have one more sem together nd lets keep commenting on others and have fun :D
Hope all ur "weird" wishes come true!! Good luck :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/karnati-chethana-reddy">Karnati Chethana Reddy</a></p>
<p>Anusha!!!!the first telugu girl i met and spoke to on campus on the first day of my college life :P  :P...We were in the same section in physics in 1st semester through which i guess we got acquainted....she is calm and composed, likes to be in her own limits, jovial, sincere at studies and likes playing guitar...  :)  :)...Wishing you all the best for your future endeavours!!!!!!!Good Luck!!!! :)  :)   :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
