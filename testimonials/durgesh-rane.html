His dancing skills need a special mentioning :D Be tat rane s dance as a part of the audience(in audi mostly during zephyr) or his stage performances ! They r totally unbeatable!

<p>Durgesh Rane, surname mein dum hai, kaash bande mein bhi hoti. On a more serious note, Rane is one fun-loving, lively and entertaining guy. Currently me EEE teacher, hes also taught me AoE and well, new ways to take everyone's case. Rane is another one of those people who can ace subjects by studying a day before the exam. Bangalore mein milte hain,  beer in hand! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>

<p>Rane-The King....A man with a zero figure.....he has lost almost all things including notebooks,books, my books(?), locks(people lose their keys he loses the locks) and many more can be added here. He has given a room cleaning contract to a company in Mumbai which visits his room once a semester and cleans it for him thoroughly.( Very good service. contact Rane for further details). Master in UNIX operating systems and he is about to get a PhD in underwater communication. His work deserves far more than PhD but PhD is just the first step for him. The value of his work increases once you know that he doesn't know how to swim. Apart from these high level things he does some normal things too. But still shows his proness in these normal things. I share some experiences of these normal things with him. 
I remember when we used to play TT till 4.30-5 am in the morning. Some random matches with verma+bunty saying Mumbai vs Bihari. But eventually he became so pro that I had to quit. Same thing happened in AoE.( thank god that he is not in mech).He loves food. knows a lot of places in mumbai which are good for food. I also remember the days when we discussed MOS concepts. But after that time this person got into real form and never looked back. His Compre Mode..ahhhh... Its because of this mode I started questioning the law of conservation of energy.. how can the efficiency be >100%  the question still remains unsolved. In the first 2 years during such compre mode he used to walk a lot in the corridor. Result: 2 cm reduction in the height of the floor. So we stopped him doing this again. 
But overall a cool pro. nice friend. 
I m sure that within next few years there will be underwater colonies and the communication will be handled by....you know who.....

<p>Rane Yo ! Neighbour and best friend in campus. We have done everything together. Started everything together. We share many things. Laziness, our mutual love for sleep, Old Monk, Classic and a certain kaum. All the road trips, night outs, Velino sessions, Bogmalo trips would have been incomplete without you. They say that a certain bond exists between people who ...you know...umm...yeah.. share...you know what I mean. Next sem I won't have him to share those things. That makes me sad. He has a certain affinity for cows. He once said they reminded him of his childhood in the village. He has been there when I was down (quite literally) and I for him (I still have the photo). Though stringent with cash, 2-3 pegs later his wallet starts shooting notes (to the extent where we have to take credit from Patram). Oh and how can I forget. AoE. I started after he did and he has certainly taught me a lot ! (17 minute castle shikav saalya). Has become a real pro at it. Survived a month without LAN. Commmendable. I guess it's time I end this testimonial, with a string of random words Tomato, Manchow, Tatti, Shera di Kaum, Saadhu, Pragesh, Nooooo, fodarfatya. -Fungii
