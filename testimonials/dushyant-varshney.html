<h1 class="page-title">Dushyant Varshney</h1><p>Dushyant ( Naam to suna hi hoga aapne,provided u knew the background of Mahabharata), Bob jokes apart,let me describe one hell of a person.Never knew a journey which started with solving Chemistry I questions, would eventually end up with we,the occasional loners sharing each others problems.The one thing unique about him is sincerity, the amount of patience he puts in each and every task whether the regular exams or his footballing skills,its simply prolific.I would wish if I had kids( only if ),I could imbibe the sincerity, tried a lot doing it myself ,but failed miserably.Haan Dusty,"Aayega aayega !! Given ur will power,success aapke life mai bahut jaldi aayega" and all my best wishes for it.

Picture abhi baaki hai mere dost, hum 4-2 mai waapas aayenge,for the remaining share of fun and footballing rivalry.

Cheers! Live Happily always.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>Dusty is a easily the most dependable and disciplined friend I know.A fierce competitor,he always gives his all in everything he does-be it studies,football or even underarm cricket.His dedication,drive and sense of responsibility are qualities I really admire,maybe because I possess none of those.Dusty never backs down from a verbal fight(for those who know "Ye Mandar ka kamra hai...").Although he does not have much right himself,he always teases people regarding girls("Sinha kal raat ko kiske saath ghoom raha tha" "Sapra aaj breakfast kaisa tha" "Arka tayyar hokar kahan jaa raha hai").A fellow proud Up-ite he frequently uses moot, bhutere and launda in his converstion.Regarding his aggression and "chaud" Dusty was the guy who in his first year was sledging fourth year guys in a Slam-cricket match(although he nearly got beaten for it).Dusty is the guy who always studies like hell during the exams and says afterwards("Yaar c**d gaya) and still gets a kick-ass CG.A fellow sasta-jokes and sports-lover(he is an ardent Chelsea-fan btw) ,Dusty is also quite helpful and caring by nature(he scolded me like hell when I missed my lab-exam). Lara once said of Dravid-"If I had to choose someone to bat for my life I'll choose Dravid",similarly if I have to choose someone to fight for my life I'll choose Dusty-the ever Mr-Dependable. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/asim-ali">ASIM ALI</a></p>
<p>Dushyant aka Dusty. People use his alias so often that one forgets what he is actually called. He is the sporting all rounder you thought you would be. Has an incredibly gentle heart with an ever ready to help attitude. He is the morning alarm of the hostel; I have attended countless tutorial tests all thanks to him. With doors always open, he is the one many friends visit when bored or in down in spirit. 
Dusty has an amazing ability to mingle with all and to help more introvert friends (no, not me :P) feel comfortable. My fellow surfer (or sufferer) of EEE and goal keeper of BITSFC . I will cherish the times I spent with him. All the best.

<p>Chaud to bachpan se hai- Dusty, I admire this guy's sincerity in everything he does be it football , studies or the verbal duels :P. He's like a live wire in the hostel, you can almost hear his voice or his name being called all the the time. People won't be able to attend classes if this guy doesn't get up. 'Dusty 5 baje utha dena.' Countless number of people will tell him this, he'll make a note of it and make sure that you get up. A proud up ite and an ardent chelsea fan. It's been a pleasure knowing you dusty<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>I know you since my 1st year but i got a better insight about you after 3-1... and once i get to know you better, well i've to say a i'd a lot of misconceptions about you. You're really focused and pretty decent in EEE. Managing extra-curricular activities with Studies is something i've to learn from you. You're a brilliant football and pretty good runner as well. Keeping these things aside i think you're a really good person and I'm obliged to met you and know you personally. Thank you for all the moments we've shared together... Have a great life ahead and best of luck for all your future endeavors.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Dusty is my neighbor, couldn’t have asked for a more enthusiastic and pumped up( boisterous actually :D ) sidey!
This guy(dude! ) from Aligarh initially came across as just a loud and attention seeking sort of personality, but his overwhelming willingness to help others, his  amiability, and his crooked sense of humour just forced to change my opinion about him.  People generally listen sounds of birds, the first thing in the morning, but in my case, (and many others)  it was dusty’s baritone! :D :D yes he acts as a morning alarm (which will ring again when you snooze!) for many a fortunate in the hostel. 
Well, that was one of the many instances of how dedicated and great a friend he can be.
He’s immensely popular,  and why not!  He’s the sportsperson of AH4, always coming forward to participate in any sport whenever needed, from the Goalkeeper of BITSFC to a Miyaan Don in AH4 FashP, he has done it all, and excelled.
He’s hardworking, dedicated to the core. Will wake up at 2 in the morning during and from a week before any exam.  
I’ll always cherish his cheap jokes and gestures! :D 
Dusty’s a performer, you can love or hate this guy, but definitely can’t ignore him.
I wish him all the luck for his future, please stay in touch. :)

<p>Dusty, busty, dust, dustesh, dustan, bustan, dushtatma, and countless other aliases for our dearest dushyant. 'Hello myself dushyant' is how he probably introduced himself to me 3 years back, and now when I look back on the epic journey we've had as corridor mates, i can't help but feel sad. Exams always trigger off abnormal hormonal secretions in dusty. With his rapid pacing, heavy breathing and 'Yeh duniya badi jaalim hai' rants, dusty has kept us all entertained during tests and hardships in general. With gems like 'Kutte bhaukte hain', 'ungli dikh rahi hai?' and 'moot peele meri', dusty is certainly one of the most profound people I know. His contortionist-like body movements and unnatural pelvic thrusts have both baffled and amused us all, especially me, chintu and jinx. I have often 'crossed the line' when it comes to taking his case, and his silent treatment has always had me begging for clemency. From the city of locks, this guy has the heart of a lion. Hardworking, intelligent, and a great friend - there are very few bustys out there, so grab em while you can. Cheers to a great 3 years, and hopefully an even better PS!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Dustyyy meri jaaaan ,mein tujhpe kurbaaan, tere bina jeena haraaam,theek hai, bas aur nhi katwaunga apni. The first memory i have of him is us playing football in childrens park and me scoring a penalty against him, he never accepted it went in, but how impressions changed. Hes truly the most hardworking person on campus, there can be no preparation for an exam without Dusty's notes. He attends every class sincerely, something i can really get myself to do. Hes also the Keeper at BITS FC, and a brilliant one at that. Hes a brilliant motivator , "Aaaaegaa team, aaeegaaa" but no one, i repeat, no one beats him at sledging, he can really take the worst out of a striker. Also a hot-head dustim ki fuse thodi jaldi udti hai, that is the level of passion and commitment he puts into every endeavour . Dusty is another person who likes taking everyone's case, especially Ali, i guess that comes with his sledging skills. Finally, dusty is slowly but surely becoming a party animal and that is why my friend, Bangalore shall be EPIC!

<p>Dusty is a worrier. Its awesome to watch him freak out about small things:P We've had so much fun together playing football for AH-4. In slam2012 when we went to penalties against CH-1 I never really believed we would win but then Dusty came up and saved half the penalties. After that I never thought we would ever loose in penalties. Those memories are unforgettable. Winning slam twice, Manipal, Goa league, BPL too many victories. He always walks around with his 'chaud' attitude like he's gonna beat up someone. When went out on bogmalo trips we would sit at a corner acting cool drinking coke and laughing at all the other guys getting high. That is until he betrayed me :P Great to know we have one more sem together. Wishing you all the best for you future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Sirjee! Probably the only guy who commands so much respect from me that I never call him by his name :P I met him while playing carrom in the first week of college - a no-nonsense guy who seemed ready to beat the hell out of anyone who came in his way. And then it all changed. He became one of the sweetest guys around, though it really wouldn't be advisable to pick up a fight with him. Calm yet short-tempered, hard-working, friendly, helpful and a great athlete - in short an amazing person and an amazing friend.  Sirjee, college ke baad bhool mat jaana! Nahi toh accha nahi hoga! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>Exam time, 2AM in the night, people planning out brilliant hopes of pulling an all-nighter and succumbing to it, enter Dusty. Deep breath in, deep breath out, repeat. And no, this is not because even he is tensed about making it up the entire night, for he already has had his power nap.
Brilliant Goalkeeper and an amazing good-natured person who knows how to keep his nerves in the toughest of situations, it was a pleasure meeting you.  We will have much more to come in 4-2. ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhaavan-merchant">Bhaavan Merchant</a></p>
