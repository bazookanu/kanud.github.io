<h1 class="page-title">Dylan J Colaço</h1><p>Dylan Colaço. I still remember the very first time I came across this guy, who later came to be called a lot of awesome names thanks to his nicks and deeds. But one name that shall stay for the rest of his life among friends is GOD. Lots of reasons for it, which shall remain in the closed circle of friends who have been the best of company through times, happy and sad. From working on the very first event we were assigned together as a part of DoPY, to the all night chats about photography and other random stuff and of course, the best part, poker and the stash ( ;) ), I remember every prank, every memory, crystal clear. The journey through BITS Pilani, Goa, would have been something entirely different if I hadn't met you and yes it was in your room that my career path altered ( :D ) Truly one of the best photographers around (And shall stay that way for a long time) and most of all, one of the few real good friends I have made on campus. 
Cheers to that friendship that I hope will last for a long time down the line.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charith-kandala">Charith Kandala</a></p>

<p>hello apple fan and photog geek :D !!!  one of the main person who mourphed DoPy _/\_ , i knew nothing when i joined DoPy, now what im is coz of dylan too.. thanks for sharing your wonderful ideas about photgraphy :respect:<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Even fifty years later if hear an exasperated "sow" anywhere around, without even thinking if 'Dylan J Colaco' could be in the vicinity or not, i would definitely start frantically looking for him :P
I am so darn grateful for joining DoPY because it has given me some of my best friends here..and Dylan is one of them. For almost a year in DoPY when i didnt know him that well, he had always been the awesome photographer, sort of like the face of dopy along with charith, a silent talent, polite and sometimes almost shy :P And then the mischievous side surfaced :D But it was fun :) He is truly a great photographer. Loves it a lot and you can see that easily when you see him with his cam or even if u just see his pics. He can even click pics without looking into the viewfinder (to my chagrin >.<,as it doesn't let me rest easy even while his cam is not in his hands :P ) He somehow manages to click great pics of me even while i am running away from the cam or trying to attack him. I have learned a lot from his photography class and from him in person as well. I will never forget that epic burnout coverage that we did..where you were taking d video n i was taking d pics with u guiding me. It was one of my best moments in DoPY. In fact, not just photography. I hardly knew anything about photoshop and editing earlier. But he has taught me so much that i have become quite comfortable with it and spend hours on it even if there is no specific work required of me. Oh! and how could i forget the pink shirt! :P One of my earliest memories of him were of the day he wore dat infamous pink shirt and every1 was talkin about it and sum1 wrote a QOD on the board about guys who wear a pink shirt ...and the absent minded me not havng seen dylan was like "but y wud ne1 guy wear a pink shirt? O.o"and den every1 looked at him and i was lyk "ook..umm.." damn dat was a bit awkward :P But he has since become a really good friend :) If he likes something, he'll put insane amount of work into it! Always there to help whenever you need him. One of the most punctual people i know. Inspite of all those fights i have come to count on him a lot. In fact i dared to go to chennai for my PS only bcoz i knew dat priyanka,dylan,HP and adi would b der. Had so much fun wid him der. I still remember when i thot i wud surprise u wid my cut hair bt u ended up shockin us instead wid ur cut moustache! ( i m sure all DoPY juniors are dying to know what a dyaln widout moustache looks lyk :P) He is not just great at photography bt his guitar playing is marvellous as well! 
And the first piece i had heard him play was the pirates of carribean theme :) Dylan, u r _/\_
And even that time when u played hotel california and Ishan sang along...it was wonderful..and d song has bcum one of my favs ever since...cn still hear and picturise u guys wn i hear d song ..really really hope u guys will do it once again! I will forever cherish all those memories, will definitely miss ur 'sad sow', the moustache and d smile through the helmet gap(:D) , the incessant clicking, the neverending laughs ...I hope that dis is nt goodbye and dat v always stay in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
<p>Dylan, my neighbour for three fantastic years in BITS Goa. Started talking to him after a few months.. till then i knew nothing about him... but then we started discussing the awesome AOE moments... slowly the topics of discussions wandered away from just AOE to other things like tech gadgets, photography and formula 1.... He is the most passionate photographer I know ... And I know no one else having as much technical knowledge about photography as him.. needless to say..even those of us outside DoPY know that he is one the driving forces of the dept. . He is still so modest that he labels himself as an "amateur" photographer on his awesome photography blog. His passion and dedication isn't limited to just that. Him playing "Pride and Joy" and the "Happy Birthday" song on his guitar and mouth organ together is one of those memories which will always be cherished...  Again one of the best guitarists i know of.... Apart from this we have countless memoirs of these 3 yrs... the time spent in his "messy" room (sry, couldn't help mention it) and the stairs discussing technology, laughing over jokes of Pranav, cursing profs....  Extremely polite, soft spoken, down-to-earth person that you are, and with your expertise in various areas, I'm sure you are going to have a wonderful successful life ahead. Best of Luck :)

<p>1 of the best photographers in the campus. He has great technical knowledge of photography and I learnt a lot from him. Not just a photographer but he is also an awesome guitar player, again 1 of the best in the campus I think.  I'll always remember the great ideas of pranks he used to come up with and then enjoy watching us play those pranks on each other :P He is the biggest apple fan, who never leaves his macbook and upgrades his iphone every year. And ofcource how can I forget his trademark hand gesture when he is angry and especially the introduction of the words 'sad bear', 'sad sow' etc which became a part of our normal language as a slang while talking in BITS :P It also kind of like became a DoPY tradition. There have been so many great fun times with him that i remember for the last 3 years and I hope it continues in the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
<p>Dylan is one of the nicest people I have met and a excellent photographer. He has wonderful taste in music - one of the few people who truly appreciate The Beatles. He has a very pleasant demeanor and good natured sense of humour which makes talking to him a delight. His help over the last 3 years with photoshop and other tech stuff has been invaluable. He's a wonderful friend to have and I consider myself very fortunate to have known him. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>One of the few Goans in BITS. Awesome guitar player, GODLIKE photographer and great friend.He has one of the messiest rooms in the campus and still he manages to find what he needs (well most of the times :P). He is the mastermind behind some of the great pranks that we have played on each-other over these years. Credited with the introduction of phrases like "sad bear" and "feed the bear cyanide" that have become an integral part of our vocabulary. There have been some awesome times with him that will never be forgotten .Hope we have some more fun times in the future. All the best!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/param-prabhu-alvenkar">Param Prabhu Alvenkar</a></p>

Dylan (or Dillon :P) is characterized by his specific hand gesture that he uses when saying ‘sad sow’ or ‘u sad bear’… :D He is a tech-geek in the true sense… A very humble, polite person.. (the way you say ‘sorry??’ is very funny :P) Had great time with him and Rujuta during PS1..[The visits to Skywalk, random place (thanks to google maps) and of course Queensland, along with the Saravana Bhavan (scaring ruju with imaginary insect :D), ice cream shop and hot cake(last day)  were memorable..] You ask him some question and he stares for few moments and then gives sheepish smile, and finally answers when you ask for the second time :D An awesome photographer that he is, cares for his camera more than anything else... After any outing, he never gives the pics without editing… He is a great apple fan and windows-hater.. Also a very good debater, always argues ‘technically’… Hope you get whatever you wish for.. Keep clicking! ;)

<p>A EEE tormented fellow of mine. A talented and intelligent photographer, very good friend with nicest of the behaviors. Will cherish all the labs we had together and the times we spent making fun of courses. Keep up your good nature man! Wish you all the success in life. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>I first met him back in the NTSE classes after 10th , I knew him as the 3/4th guy since he was the only person among 20 odd people to not wear a full pant which seemed like a very odd thing back then. Fast forward to 2009 and I met him again @BITS as one of the 10 goans of our batch. Since then we've been together most of the times.  It is impossible to write about every awesome encounter that we shared in a testimonial but a few things about him that stand out can be said. First and foremost he is a Photography genius ! By that I dont just mean that he is that garden variety photographer who takes good pics and shows them off but also the fact that he knows almost the entire science behind photography. The amount of knowledge he has is insane. Right up there with the pros. He'll have an answer to every single photography related question you have. And I daresay I asked too many :P but if you ask Dylan something regarding stuff that he likes, he'll even leave compre exam studies for it :P He is that dedicated. We joined Dept of Photography together and attended every meet together and though he did much more work for it, we've formed the core of the dept and have been associated with it throughout the 3 years in BITS. In a sense he revolutionized DoPy with all the technical aspects that he introduced in still photography and editing. Apart from this, Dylan is a crazy Apple fan. Not like the kind of people who drool over the products from a distance. He actually owned an iPhone 2G, iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4S in the 3 years @ BITS. He also has a 6 year old macbook which he just refuses to give away despite of all the torture its been through. He really loves it and knows it inside out which is what matters. There was a time when his HDD crashed, his battery bulged which led to trackpad and keyboard problems and some random heating problems because the fan stopped working. He has fixed all these problems by himself and never complained when most others would've thought of getting a new piece. He is a really good guitar player and has been called the best in the campus by many good guitar players that I know. His signature song is "Pride and Joy". He has worked for 1 sem for our Music club . He can also play the guitar and mouth organ at the same time. All thanks to him, I bought a second hand guitar (recommended by him) and learnt on my own. He and Arjun have been big help in clearing my doubts about music theory. He embraces practicality and has done really well in parts of the curriculum he believes will be useful later in life and horribly in the rest :P His sense of humor is very good and is usually based around giving a very practical analogy that will make people realize that what they were saying is wrong. Dylan will also be known for his prominent mustache, his funny way of running and his unintentionally funny gestures which have been a big source of humor :D English is his forte, everything else is pitiable :P Makes you wonder how he survived the 2 months at Chennai :D During our time @ BITS, we have coined many terms together the most famous of which is "Sad Bear" accompanied with a characteristic horizontal hand rake :P which has been injected into the DoPy DNA :D He has always been helpful with many things and I am glad to have had a genius helpful friend like him. All the best and thanks for the Easter eggs 8-o !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>

Now after being with him for a long time all i can say is ......... hez a caring,friendly,creative genius..... It all started with DoPy where he had an awesum cam which evry1 liked to use :P.... Till date hez considered to be the _/\_est photographer in our campus in my view.... he used to help me a lot till the end of 2nd year as a friend......But then we became  cordis and EEE also made us flock together :D ........... The 1 single year has totally changed my relationship with him....We had gr8 time in quark Co-co as well as EEE labs :D (especially analog electronics :P )... He gradually became one of my closest  friends. and now i thank god that we are not departing in immediately after 3rd year :D . Few of the distinct qualities abt DJC are.... Hez very sincere... thinks a lot b4 he lies :P ..... has a different impressive way of humour which evry1 will appreciate if they understand :D .... a die hard fan of apple,Mac OS , Iphone... A very talented person in acads which i came to noe when he suddenly started topping communication courses in 3-2 (:O yes!!) .......creator of few trademark words like "sad bear" "sad sow" "sad Cow" with his funny hand gestures :D :D...... A true PHOTOGRAPHER whom many ppl take as inspiration...... a very good leader who always keeps himself and ppl arnd him cool........ and lastly an awesum guitarist who has a gr8 sense of Music...... He has been one such personality who has revolutionized DoPy in many aspects. We had wonderful time playing pranks on ppl , working together in DoPy as well as labs, having fun in trips....... Lets have some more when we come back in 4-2 :P :P .... ....... Lets always keep in touch forever .........hope that i keep visiting Goa jus for the sake of meeting u,ishan and pranav :D....

<p>Wow. I met this guy on BITS 360. Both of us were Mechies. Yea, both of us did get upraded to EEE later. Whether I liked EEE or not is a different thing, but it surely made me know more about this amazin dude. First of all, DONT look at his cG. This guy is DAMN smart. He would read MT 2 experiments in a minute and understand them, and then perform them for us, we would just keep looking at his awesome work !! And yes, this guy is damn patient. He withstood all my stupid questions in Commsys and TSSN and solved my doubts. I owe my grades in these two subjects to you !! Its been great knowing you, and Im sure you will create wonders in the Communications Fields. All the best !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mrinmay-milind-kulkarni">Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni</a></p>
