<h1 class="page-title">Edwin Abraham</h1><p>He is perhaps one of the very few I found to be absolutely unique in the entire campus. Good hearted and very frank, I have come to enjoy every second I spent with him ( usually accompanied by copious amounts of alcohol ). Yes man, I love you too (and I will call you to my wedding :| ). The puddle of time, the weird theories that beat sarath's philosophies will stay with me for the rest of my life and I am really happy to have been your friend. Keep up your positive outlook and you will achieve great things. Cheers mate :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishnu-prasad">Vishnu Prasad</a></p>
<p>Very good person at heart, frank, knows how to smile even in the toughest of situation. Someone you would always want to be in your friend circle. Great ideas and even great sense of humor. Though our interaction was limited, i have always enjoyed my conversation or our little bouts ( :P ). Always be in touch brother, it was great knowing you. All the best for your future life and wish you great success and happiness. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>Edwin :D....i will always remember you as the owner of www.eddusthoughts.blogspot.com :P .
The first i have to say about him is that hes immensely patient especially for tolerating me for all these years :D .Come to think about it I really dunno how he managed (if it were me in his position i would have killed me then and there XD ).Hes been a gr8 frnd & my EG lab buddy (dunno if he knows this but i managed to score a few marks peeping into his comp...never told him).You cant write about this guy without mentioning his RS philosophies (u know what i mean by RS don't you :P ) .But it was gr8 fun hanging out with him.Will never forget the cab ride back from Panjim that day and the song u made up about me(i m singing it in my head as i write this :D ) .Hope u get only the best in future and never change. PS-Thanks again for not beating me up, i really deserved it though :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>During my initial days on campus I was scared of him owing to his gigantic frame..But I am telling you every aspect of this guy is endearing..He is calm. cheerful, genuine, helpful...He has had his hard times but has found a reason to himself up all the time..This guy has a great spirit...Good luck man..You will always be fondly remembered by me..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>
