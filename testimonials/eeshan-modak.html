<h1 class="page-title">Eeshan Modak</h1><p>Bappi is one tireless guy who loves to play, be it any sport- Futsal, Football, Cricket, Tennis anything. Its like his mum didn't allow him to play when he was kid, he is that eager to play all the time. Brilliant at studies, one of the most intelligent people I know. Very humble, helpful and polite.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Bappi ! We've shared 3 farewells till now but have never said goodbye. From PTV to Golden Gate to BITS, we you have been a constant companion. From being a model student in school to laughing off an E (Opr-E :D ), you've done it all. One guy I can say who BITS has changed for the better ! Scarily smart. By his marks has created the myth that he studies a lot. Completely untrue. He has developed a lite attitude off late, which has been fun. Also he has become a fitness freak. Overcompensation for being a fat kid ( The 'Bappi' mystery solved eh). Loves playing football and cricket and pretty good at both. Loves gossiping. So Baps, it's gonna be tough parting because having you around has kinda become a habit after
these long 7 years. Live long and Prosper ! - Fungii

<p>Baapi or chotta Kabi loves to run. He has jogged from our campus to Panjim (just kidding). He has done it till Bogmalo. (which is still an achievement) A football freak who watches 1 , atmost 2 matches per semester, Bappi is also pretty good at the game. Apart from football, Bappi loves gossiping about the popular guys and gals of campus and has everyone of them on his facebook friend list. He has been my neghbour for the past 3 years and life without him would have been very dull. Though he was very shy at first , he has changed a lot since the first day I met him. He is a cool guy to hang out with and it has been a pleasure to know you. Wish you best of luck for the future.
PS- Hope you get your legspinners to spin someday.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
<p>Bappi!!!! I have known you much before BITS (though I didn't recognize you when we first met here :P) but I really came to know you well in BITS. Being a rather sincere student in the first sem to enjoying your last sem fully, you have come a long way and for the good (this bappi is far more better than the previous one :D) You are a true sprots enthusiast and love playing Cricket and Football. You are the gossip guy of our hostel who knows all the recent happenings on campus. A fond memory that I will have of you is the way you blushed when you came to know that someone in Abhigyaan (you know who :P) called you cute!!!! Have a great life ahead and I am sure you will be a very successful person. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>EEEshan Modak. The Marathi Manus. The 9P from our corridor who has even lesser marks than me in Opre. [AAOC \m/] Is bande ko bas sab kuch karna hai. Sabki baatein karni hai, Futsal khelna hai, Saal mein ek baar football highlights dekh ke khud ko Ardent Football supporter bolna hai, Aoe discuss karna hai but khelna nahi. The guy who used to have the Perfect Routine for the day. At the same time, His midnight Pee Trips and Take Fungii's case Sessions, have surely kept us entertained through these years. A Die Hard Megadeth Fan, A - Mess Lover [Must've had the most number of meals in these three years] and a Chaman's thighs' Connoisseur, I'm sure these three years would not have been the same without you. Wishing you the very best in life. Khoob Paise Kama, Phir treats hongi :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>Eeshan (this is the first and last time I'm gonna call him that) has the mot adorable nickname ever - Bappi. One of the nicest and most humble guys around, it's great fun to be in his company! I think I got to know Bappi properly only because of Chhapia's little 'inputs', which ensured that Bappi's name would always brings a big grin to my face :D You'll never catch Bappi without a smile, and it's not without reason that this brilliant chap is adored by all who know him. Some unforgettable moments with Bappi are of him proudly defending Vile Parle's awesomeness by citing its real estate prices, and walking into Chhapia's room looking smashing in a suit...only to have us burst out laughing! I have no doubts that he's gonna do very well for himself, knowing him has been a pleasure :)

<p>Bappi...such a lovely nickname to such an adorable person. Though I really like the name Eeshan, I have rarely used it. He, just like many of my other hostel friends, became first an acquaintance and then a close friend because of TT. I can never forget those awesome memories of playing TT for hours together in common room :). He is a fun loving person, you can always expect him to be in the thick of action. Was pretty much dedicated to acads for the first few semesters but then became a true Bitsian by taking li8 :D.  I have really enjoyed watching sports with you because we have always been on the same side, be it in supporting Team India(ob!!), or Federer or Barcelona. A person you know you can always rely on. Bappi has been an amazing presence in the hostel and has been a part of soo many wonderful memories. Truly a very good friend of mine. All the best for your future, you will go a long way ahead :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>Bappi...The gossip king of the corridor..He was once a sincere BITS student but now he has lost the sincerity completely. He is always interested in knowing what is happening in the campus as well as in the world outside campus. I remember him saying " Abe aise kaise wo uske sath ghum sakti hai?" after watching a girl walking with a guy. We always enjoy his comments on such occasions. During exams he used to lock himself up in his room ( we used to call it concentration camp because of his very very high CG). But now he has changed which is reflected by his behavior and also by his marks ( OPRE )."There is always a Stark in Winterfell". Likewise there is always a TOI  tab in his IE running 24*7. The movies and documentaries suggested by him are always awesome. We always discuss documentaries and movies that we have seen in the corridor. He is passionate about his T-shirts. He loves them so much that he can't take them off for days.( I can't tell you the number as I am still counting). But thanks to the guy who invented deodorant. He loves playing football and cricket and is good at them. The thing that I like about him that he never wastes food in the mess. He neither even  wastes the heat that is absorbed by the glass of tea. He uses that glass to warm his eyes. He saves electricity by closing unnecessary fans, tubes etc in the corridor which is really a good thing though he fails to do it in case of Chhapia who doesn't like his fan getting switched off. He thinks logically though fails to take decisions on time.( I think he thinks too much). Famous for his last minute preparation for labs, lab reports etc etc. I always enjoy the discussions we have on various things and its always nice to have a TV with a news channel in your corridor who keeps you updated. All the best to you Bappi ( Not for your future dude but for OPRE :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Bappi- Whenever I first heard of him,it was his CGPA,however never knew he would be so fun to hang around with. My first interaction with him-he handed me defeat in TT qualifiers,I hate loosing but not to him,the smile on his face, the will to live and enjoy life is rarest of rare qualities I have seen. The non stop day long gully cricket matches, catching up with sports in the common room, vellapanti in and around the hostel, he forms part of my best memories in the campus.He is intelligent, a health freak(daily jogging who does) and one of the best persons I have come across. Never change Bappi, ten years down the line I would like to meet you , go on a nice trip, share  stories.Best of luck with life,cheers ! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>Peeshan Todak aka Bappi.. My buddy mate during PS who has special liking to sledge hammer :P .. Awesome guy,fun loving,emotional and knowledgeable.He likes to keep himself updated about whatever happens in the world.A newspaper and sports addict.He lives life in his own way.Calm and composed,softspoken and kind at heart.The times we spent during PS will always be memorable.I can never forget the incident (though I forgot the scientist's name,when we(also durgesh) had gone to ask for project at Ceeri and how we burst into laughter in front of him.Man if you start the burst of laugther ,it's really tough to control from there on.It was such a fun time.Down to earth and humble,this guy talks on very practical terms.Hope to be in touch with you.Best wishes..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shabbar-a--vejlani">Shabbar A  Vejlani</a></p>
<p>BAPPII!!!! This guy is stupendously awesome. Always has a smile on his face, a reflection of his positive attitude. Everything for him is a challenge which magnifies his already massive appetite for awesomeness. The coolest dude on BITS, it has been my extreme fortune to meet him in my life. I have learnt a lot from him, how to be a nerd, how to kewl, how to manage public affairs and most importantly how to make friends. This guy has zero ego. ZILCH!! He always seeks the best for other (he is not threatened by others competition). As I said earlier, he has a very positive and optimistic attitude which always enables him to see tumbler always 'half full' with an opportunity to fill it. We have had our share of awesome moments playing TT, Cricket, during matches, mess gossip (Oh Yeah, he is THE gossip girl of our batch), pseudo-intellect talks on world affairs, the uncountable bogmalo trips, the random corridor masti, the time you all visited my home........... Gosh its endless!! Sadly we never were in the same corridor. Koi naa..... We will spend more time together next sem :D :D Cheers to that!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
