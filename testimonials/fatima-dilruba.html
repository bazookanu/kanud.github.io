<h1 class="page-title">Fatima Dilruba</h1><p>she's one busy girl. Talented and really hardworking! had an awesome time (however li'l that was!) working with her for Waves. shes really fond of her Mallu tradition. Extremely cultured and and pays family values a very high regard. genuine respect for her 
i have always been a fan of her eyes. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>Busy as a bee, super talented and hardworking. Came to know her in the 1st year through docw ( when i still was a part :P) and my respect for her has always increased since. A real genuine person, very jovial and fun to hang out with. She makes her voice be heard( try speaking on the mike in the audi with people shouting random stuff /\) Will always remember her as a good friend :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>She is one my best friends. We have been through thick and thin. We have been at each others throat and but we have also been there at the end of each crappy day. I will tell you this, Fatima Dilruba is a friend who will stick by you whatever happens (just don't poke her when she eats food). She is strong bold woman (although i am not sure whether she likes that). And a female who will reach places because of her sheer determination. Fatima Dilruba reaching for the stars (Cheesy I know). Make her laugh, it's contagious!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/edwin-abraham">Edwin Abraham</a></p>
<p>Words escape my mouth when I sit next to her; Mind becomes numb when I catch a glimpse; Thoughts become feelings when she speaks to me. What is this?

There have been times when I felt the urge; There have been occasions when I had the confidence; There were moments when I was about to pop the question.

I wish my silence could speak a thousand words; I wish the time would have been still when the very sight of her draped in her sari enchanted and mesmerized me; I wish I could have taken a picture with both of us in the same frame.

Yet I hope that when I go down on my knees and extend my hand, she does the very same with a friendship band :P

Jokes aside, I have tremendous respect for Fatima as a speaker (though I still consider myself to be better :D). She always seems to radiate the aura of a meticulous, dexterous and strong willed person. Besides wishing her the best of luck in her future endeavors, I hope to meet her somewhere 10 years down the line to see how she ultimately utilized her illimitable potential.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paparazzi">Paparazzi</a></p>

<p>fatima! three minutes in her room and i'm humming out all my dreaded secrets in her ear. what sorcery is this?
she sits besides me in the class once in a while and she will lend a sympathetic ear when i want to rant. she can talk about anything! and her hair! what smoooothhhh silky hair you have! imma steal them one day babe! :-*
at the end of the day, fatima is the go-to girl when you wanna have fun. she just has that charisma and more than once we have hit the dance floor and put bollywood choreographers to shame. i will miss all the epic dj nights we had. all the head thumping and tumkas. everybit of it! every moment i confessed my secrets! i will always cherish them! they were epic! Dont go away....my baby :'(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>
<p>I had a feeling i was missing someone ...took a while to figure out it was you:P. Now what can i say about this girl except most of my encounters with her was hand to face :'(  [her hand with considerable speed and acceleration on my  face......again and again..no mercy ). I still get nightmares when i think about all that. Other than all that shes a bit of a childish character. Innocent at heart,and will help out others without a second thought. Shes been an active member in nirmaan and was the head of the compering club.Wishing u all the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>I have seen you for the last three years. I just want to ask you one thing, what exactly do you do for the first 15 mins of each and every lecture? You attend all the lecture, be it CDCs, non-CDCs or even TIME classes, but you'd be always 15 minutes late, even for the consecutive lectures. Where do you go? <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>A sensible sense of humour which most girls generally do not posses is just one of the few traits u would find in this one-of-a-kind being.A face with a 70 mm smile..what comes to ur mind when u think of her..although ,thats not the only face she has :P. Talking about her face,compliment her once about her compereing skills and see for urself how each drop of blood in her body compete to rush to her face. At the same time,she never acts miserly when it comes to giving compliments....and has any1 tried challenging her about somethng??? try it once..and see for urself what follows..also Respects and values money,thinks twice before spending even a paisa,a feature that is getting fast extinct in people.and is someone who would go out of her way  to help others.I doubt if there is anyone who knows her but hasnt taken any help from her ..In simple words, someone with a heart of gold (uummmm...so does a hard-boiled egg, so.. dont get flattered rightaway :D) Too determined and stands rock-firm on her decisions (......until she gets swayed away by the thoughts som1 else succeeded in putting inside her).She does what she feels is right (wouldnt spare even broken glass pieces from Ice-n-Spice to prove that) .
Inspite of all this, a kid at heart with unmatched innocence and quite truthful...  u will hardly hear lies coming from her mouth.Cares a lot about others,can never keep hatred in her heart towards someone for more than a couple of days,is just another distinguishing & signature characteristic...forgets things  easily.  http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/3078222_700b.jpg <-- not of this kind,i meant.thats all.Probaly the only thing u should improve upon is ur ability to understand people.Read hearts , sweet words have the power to deceive you. Extremely ambitious.Never had I thought girls could be this ambitious.Has immense social awareness and a genuine sense of social responsibility.You can always see an urge in her to give somethng back to the society. And above all ,a mature lady and a true human being.Folks,if you still think all this was a part of testimonial-flattery , just see the last comment in the image and tell me if anyone else in the world other than this girl can think like this...Had seen this almost an year ago,but just couldn't get rid of this from my memory. http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/2540/reply2.png<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anonymouse">AnonyMouse</a></p>
<p>Fatimaaa!!! The one person who was with me both in my Mallu gang and in Nirmaan. I can never tell you how much our friendship means to me. I could always count on her support, whenever I was under stress. It's amazing how she can keep away her distress and work without letting anyone else know about what is troubling her (of course, by anyone I don't mean those who are very close to her!). Can bounce back from any situation within seconds. Fun loving person who likes to plan trips and treats, loves movies like anything, listens to songs 24*7, craves for good food, has an addiction to be late for almost all appointments (:P), impressive speaker (/\) and most importantly values family relations and friendship above everything else..  She can talk for hours about everything under the sun, except her ENI CDCs ( :P ) and gets excited when given a mike (its true!).  I could go on and on forever Fatima, but it will still be not enough!
I consider myself lucky to have you as my friend. (But you already knew that :D ). I am sure you'll be very successful in life. And I am sure, our friendship will go a long way, even after we leave the campus. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
<p>Dilru Didi is the one of the best orator I’ve seen. The way she speaks is really awesome…confident, frank, open minded, up to the point. Even the Zari women love the way she teaches them English, the way she explains each and every minor thing with the best possible examples (they have been missing you). It was only after I joined in NIRMAAN that we became friends, until then I’ve heard from many of my friends about her work in NIRMAAN. She is a very friendly person, actually she can hold up a conversation with any random person on the earth regarding any random topic. In spite of staying in the library for most of the tym(u can hardly see her studying. She keeps on roaming arnd :D), she managed the NIRMAAN-PR work (supposedly the most hectic work) in a brilliant manner. Especially the NGO-Confluence cannot go unmentioned, I was really mesmerised by the way she planned and organized it. It was a really huge success…Hat’s off to you Dilru, for handling the event in such a brilliant structured manner. Though I’ve never said this, I think you have a really good dressing sense and a nice smile. Keep smiling. She’s one another typical “girl” (I still remember tat dots like paint on ur nails :O :O…how can u ppl even get tat much patience??!!). Apart from being so sincere at allotted work and hardworking, Fatima is a really very funny girl; she always lightens up the mood when she’s around with her “Display of love” towards Chechi, her childish character. Cannot forget that Vijayendra Varma story, the one which we framed sitting in Bogmalo (the long lost kid, adopted kid, coma and then finally the most hilarious part…getting Setty into the story \m/ the best part :D :D) She has got a really good music sense(except that she keeps on listening to “rolling in the deep” again and again :P). Anyways it was really good knowing you and I’ll always remember the fun moments we all have spent together in NIRMAAN, and I hope we’ll stay in touch. May your dream of “Starting a school with value-based education” come true. Have great life ahead!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srinivasa-lahiri">Srinivasa Lahiri</a></p>
<p>Heads up... I hope she accepts this testimonial, coz she mite not see it amidst a whole lot of others waiting for her! :P . One of the most popular people on campus, she is/was a member of many clubs and departments. She has got one of the sweetest smiles. She is very helpful and genuinely understanding. She knows most of the people around the campus and became very popular during first year (a good reason for that was her doubts :P) . She is nice to talk to , but she is a wet matchstick(too slow, not even tube light :P. Sorry for this) .She is really hardworking and is a strong woman (well physically too...ask Aswin GIGI, he might have some stories :P). I am sure she will succeed in life. Great wishes for the future :). Keep in touch!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/seby-jacob">Seby Jacob</a></p>
<p>Fatima, one of the most cheerful girl on campus. You can never see her sad (very few times but for very short...u actually have to be lucky to see her like that). I know her since 11th standard as we were in the same JEE coaching (Vidyarthi, Chembur). From there only, i realized that she was a very hardworking and sincere girl. Always asking doubts she would delay the class by atleast 15 mins :P . But after comin to campus and meeting her again, i realized that there was more to her sincere side. She is the most kindest girl. I admire her work with nirmaan, the way she handles the work, its truely awesome. Working with her in DoCW was fun. Truely creative, she has got a brilliant mind. Also she is the most popular girl on campus. U will never see her alone. Loved by all her friends, She is a truely amazin girl. I wish her good luck for her future. Hope her wonderful attitude takes her places. GoodLuck Fatima. :D :D .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Fatima is very smart and an outspoken. I still remember i told seniors about her attitude problem and they screwed sikhil for it :P Later I realized what a great person she is! Always working for nirmaan and well being of the down trodden etc. Great orator / compere r, the crowd just can't sit quiet when she's on stage:P Had some great memories together.Will miss you phathuma!
