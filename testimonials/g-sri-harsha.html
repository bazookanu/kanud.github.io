<p>"The Ungult  / Dravidian", "Gummy " (a result of hi gay fascination with gummy bear and Patil's request which ended up as "gimme beer") , "The superstudd " !!! Sri. G Sri Harsha ;D 'Apko Pranam' :D . Well he happens to be one of my closest buddies , one off rare finds , uncut, undisturbed shards of stone that that enamour and captivate. I directly and indirectly owe him so much , it's hard to list. ( GSoC for starters ??? I wanted to go binge and he forced me to sit in and go for it ). He is one of those friends that have made a massive difference to my life and changed its course for the better. His manic frenzy is infectious and irritating but captivating, it's like he's supercharged on Viagra or some herb. An immature little git who stumps us with them wise words. To top it all, he's very talented , finally free from the "shackles of the system", I am sure very soon this kid will have a visiting card screaming "I am CEO Bitch !". I wish our paths wind up at the same destination some day and we could create something superfuckinglywhackedoutinsane. Hanging out and spending time with you has been a treat and something I will cherish for eternity. Good Luck and more importantly, STAY IN TOUCH , else i assure you a wailing  banshee shall molest your cat. ~~ Shine on You Crazy Diamond .

<p>Harsha is a brilliant guy. A talented cricketer, musician, pro at acads - a proper all rounder. He is one of the most confident people I have met. When he comes on to speak, you sense that here's a guy who knows his stuff. He's a fantastic orator.. his casual, easy going manner of speaking is very effective. He is also very intelligent and the remarkable success that he has had  - things like CIMA and Hult are a reflection of what he's going to do in the future. He's very cheerful, has a great sense of humour and it's always fun having him around. It's been very nice knowing you and I wish you all the best for your future endeavors. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Harsaaa! The Gult guy who denies. I first saw him at cricket selections in our first semester, when he was trying out as wicket-keeper. He was amazing behind the stumps, and i was stumped, so to speak, when i saw him dive and catch balls inside the nets. Since then, I've played almost all my games for the college with him behind the stumps, and its been a great run. He's caught me a few wickets too. He's the ultimate team man, and he does anything that is required of him (although he cribs sometimes) , such as batting at no. 9. We've won Spree together, and nothing beats that. Apart from cricket he switches roles between a NERD (note the capital letters), manager, business analyst, competition winner, 5-year old kid, lunatic, and one of my best friends. I had a lot of fun working in the Special Nites department along with him. If there's anyone who knows how to get work done, it is him. Be it getting the judges for events, helping out with SeaRock venues, handling the nites and managing all those surprise obstacles on the way, he does it with such ease you would never know there was a problem in the first place. Now that he's in charge of the Special Nites department, I'm sure this Waves is going to be crazy good. 

One of the most genuine people i've come across in the campus, he's very frank and tells it like it is, even if a few people mind, and that's a quality I respect. His energy is boundless! He can go on for a 100 days without sleep and you wouldn't be able to tell, although when he falls asleep, that is it. The only way to wake him up is probably an air strike. I must also add that he's been the greatest supporter of Paperkraft, and we owe a lot to him and his manajjing skills :D We've had great times throughout these 3 years (sober and otherwise), with the arrows that point the other way, on the field, off the field, making our own brand of psychedelic music and so much more. I cant keep ranting forever, so i'll stop. He's awesome. That's it. No arguments. He will make shitloads of money and then i shall live in the outhouse of his estate, mooching off him for the rest of my life :D Here's to a lifetime of friendship! 

 Of course i can't sign off before saying those words. A P Kolay. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>Machaaaaaaaa(n)! We have had lots of insanely awesome times in the last three years. If I remember correctly, it started in 1-2 when me and TB were sitting on the bench in front of yours. You went,  "Ah, Dhruva and Dhruva!" I was like, who the hell is this guy?! But damn, its been fun hanging out with you. 
I was never an outdoor person. I was quite happy hanging out with good old 'Friends' and 'Frasier' in my room. But I guess things changed after the pizza night before our last exam in 2-1. And then we had the awesome post T2 party at Bog. After that, it was all "Dude, what do you wanna do today? Bogmalo or Bogmalo?" Hah! I owe it all to you. 
One thing I admire the most about you is your people skills. You gel so well with everyone, you quite often tell them what you think of them, and even if it isn't pleasant, no one is offended. It only brings you closer to people and I don't see anyone else who has the ability to do that. You rarely care what people think of you, and that's another quality that'll take you a long way. You've achieved so much already. China, Dubai, and now a potential (some other awesome place you won't tell me unless you get in). Not to forget winning our college the Spree Cricket trophy, and the Waves special nights (starting off with a kick ass teaser page) that you'll be managing, you multi-talented NaReal! I'll always remember you telling me, "Dude, once you start achieving great things, the hunger will drive you a long long way to achieve even greater things." And in both our cases, it sure has!
Also, Econ would never have been so much fun without you. I remember our customary Frappe after MoS in 2-2 which has now been transformed into the "Strong CB" and will be Frappe again next sem since WE GOT CH-1!! Next year is going to be epic again and if all goes according to plan, PS in Bangalore too! 
You've not changed a bit in the 2 years I've known you and I wish you be the same old Gummy for the rest of your life. Wish you the best f'in luck man! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neil-dhruva">Neil Dhruva</a></p>
<p>Gummy boy. The cool Telugu dude who isn’t – isn’t anything Telugu, I mean. Insanely multi-talented, he’s equally at home on the cricket pitch, in formal attire giving badass presentations, being the youngest guy on campus to own CIMA, organizing campus events or, even, being Paperkraft’s first extra :D (sorry, dude) He’s probably the only guy I know who is genuinely getting one of those cool visiting cards very soon. I won’t say it’s gonna read “I’m CEO, bitch” ‘cause he’s capable of things beyond that. It’s unfair to set a ceiling to what he can achieve. All those remarkable stints he’s done abroad are testament to that fact (or saying it using my latest obsession – nigga’s got credentials yo). He’s got this enviable ability of gelling with anyone, never giving a damn about people’s opinions about him and stating his about them upfront. That’s something I really wish I could do. Whenever I meet him, he’s either attached to Pushkar or Neil and I absolutely enjoy taking his case about it (sorry dude :P) Hopefully, he won’t cut me off because of that and I'll end up staying friends with the future doyen of India Inc.

<p>Put a DP you dickhead. Very mainstream boy, this one. Only Bon Jovi and Inception, nothing else. Very orthodox Dravidian, refuses to accept the existence of other, far superior races. Dedicated towards his cricket and 'his' special nights. Also, the most useless member Paperkraft will ever have. Recently crossed over to the dark side, Harsha is mad fun if he's in his element, although hostile when pissed, which is often. He possesses the superpower to turn the pettiest of things into an argument. Trust next Waves to be killer, because this guy's gonna work his ass off.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
