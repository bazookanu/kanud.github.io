<h1 class="page-title">Gargi Biswas</h1><p>Gargi Biswas is a fine woman and a great friend. She is a very good singer and she performed really well in 2nd year in the Janmashtami. Moreover I have heard to of her songs that she had sung with her brother and no doubt Shubhodeep bhaiya has done a great job! Gargi is a diligent student and very intelligent person. She is sober and a calm person. I wish her a great and successful future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Now I can say that she is by far the closest friend I have made in BITS. We've been hanging around right from day one of college if I am right and it is quite a deal that our friendship has grown this far as that doesn't always happen. 

She's dedicated when it comes to studies and other work. An EXCELLENT singer. Her voice quality can be matched with a professional singer. I really wish she had gotten the opportunity to show it off in front of the campus. And not the mention, she's a great keyboard player to...the effortless movement of her fingers across the keyboard especially when she plays Fur Elise. 

Her jokes which can be really ridiculous at times actually lightens things up. As she says, you do need such PJ crackers around you. Her sleep timings are epic. At times it can be annoying particularly when she is asleep in the evenings. I guess that's all I can write about her for the public to read. Hope we stay in touch forever. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-yegnamurthy">Neha Yegnamurthy</a></p>
<p>Gargeeee ! This is how I usually greet her on Gtalk and what fun it has been. I regret not meeting you earlier . I added her on Gtalk to get help regarding some assignment but now, we've become great chat buddies ! Very sweet and very talkative, it been real fun with you. Obviously real smart too. We share the same fucked up sleep cycle. Amazing singer too(Take my advice please). One of the friendliest people I know. Its been fun sharing music with you. This year was fun and next year just because we won't have the same dual please don't stop pinging :D . Cheers and let the music never stop ! -Fungii

<p>Gargi, before writing a testimonial for her I took a huge sheet of paper to jot down all the talents that she possesses , BACK AND FORTH!! Gargi is gifted with one of the sweetest voice, perhaps her name ,Nightingale, or tweety with which i call her. I'l always thank Nehal, for introducing you to me... Your songs transport me to a whole new world of sheer peace and santity. An incredible artitst, whose works are truly inspiring. The thing that  I like most about you is your bubbling childish spirit, coupled with your sweetness , which you have managed to keep intact living in these bits-ercumstances..
We have had awesome times together, the prom night, topping the list, the salsa dance following it :P ... And how could I forget, we both runnning all around  Mumbai, surviving those blasts!! phew!!.. Three years in BITS has been an awesome journey, and even imagining it without your presence in it?? naaah!!! not possible..... Thanks for being the friend who understood me the most, a huge support and a patient listener, to whom i can ping anytime and blurt whatever im thinking at that time.... May you attain whatever you strive for, wish you all the very best for your future , tweety!

<p>Gargi!!!! The most cheerful person ever... and one of my closest friends... Gargi never fails to lift my spirits... and when we start talking we might never stop... she's the friend every girl needs, to vent it all out once in a while... to bitch about those who drive you crazy... try to understand those you have never understood...discuss academics.. never ending projects assignments... and the unavoidable topic of our utterly uneventful love lives... i  cant imagine what college would have been without all of these... Waking up to her rooster alarm... the phone conversations that i can hear right into my room... and her never ending tryst with classical music have made my life oh! so musical! :P ... And her big eyes!!! What do i say about them! its a pleasure to see the excitement move from her smile to your eyes and then gradually to the whole of her! ( characterised by SHM of her  hands...) ...She leads a balanced life... works when she needs to and has all the possible fun when its possible... and i admire her for that... She is great at making friends... sometimes she behaves like this know it all mature lady.... at most times she's just her extremely innocent chirpy bubbly self.... Gargi...its been an absolute pleasure having you opposite my room....Shouting "GORGI!!" every now and then...Our oh so memorable trips to the water cooler:P ... and remember our POM mugging sessions ?? You are one of the most understanding people in my life... and i know i can always count on you... for all the hugs and all the smiles...All ill say in i love you!! Keep smiling always! <3<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>Gargi. The girl with one of the sweetest smiles ever. We always have something to talk about, don’t we? That might be because we both have music, or because we share a natural mutual  understanding which people call friendship. I prefer the latter. Which by the way brings to my mind: what a great singer you truly are! Yours is the most beautiful voice on campus as of now –no music club girl can compete with that! And you also play some great piano (I’ve heard your Fur Elise recording) – I’m truly jealous. You totally have a big professional singer in you – I’m sure - but then you have Physics which I totally hate so there our interests do not match. :P Gargi is the sweet, cheerful, down to earth, always smiling, intelligent and humble friend you have always hoped for. She has that silvery kind of laugh which makes you wanna laugh too! And she’ll be there for you with a song if ever you need it. So there! Who could ask for more? Thank you, Gargi,  for always appreciating me. I needed that.  May you have everything you wish for in your life. With your qualities and talents, you’ll be declared great in no time. In hopes of your success and happiness… farewell!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
<p>Chubby cheeks, dimple chin, curly (wavy?) hair, rather fair and very lovely :P :). Kudos to you for being ‘better late than never’ for classes this year :P . You have a cheering up presence. You always leave me broadly smiling (and sometimes blushing) after talking to you. I miss your keyboard playing, so please get it back next semester. I am looking forward to loads of more fun with you; will be back to laugh with you a lot more. Love. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/surbhi-khetrapal">Surbhi Khetrapal</a></p>
<p> Gargi.. one of the closest friends I have made on campus. I don’t think I have ever been “more myself” with anyone else before as I have been with her. I am an introvert and I generally prefer my own company over anyone else’s, but being with Gargi is just like being with myself, simply because I am so comfortable around her. When I talk to her I do not have to think, words just come out of my mouth. Gargi is least biased, with childlike innocence and at the same time mature enough to judge people and situations correctly. She is never pretentious, and hardly ever bitches. It is a not easy to meet such a positive, understanding and non-judgmental person these days. She is firm by her opinions and choices, at the same time never judges others for differing from her. She is talkative and almost always speaks her mind. She is a complete artist. She draws, she paints, she’s a trained dancer, plays the keyboard (fur elise :) :) !!!!) and she has a heavenly voice :) :)… keep singing Gargi, it just sounds so nice… I am always amused by her childishness and laugh at everything she says… because she is just so amusing… her presence exudes some kind of a positivity which always triggers a smile to my face. Gargi, you were ri8 when you said “Mujhe rona dhona pasand nahi hai. Mera face uske liye bana nahi hai”.. :P :D That’s so true.. hasti rehna, khush rehna, hasati rehna… best wishes for everything.. hope you reach gr8 heights in whatever you do :) :) :)!!!!

<p>That Gargi ( as Pk Das used to often say ) whose loose colourful pants i used to like ...through this one year of physics courses i discovered what a bubbly inncocent person she is ! She is just like a kid so frank and adorable ! Always cheerful and and wow her room radiates her personality ! Amazingly decorated with colourful paper all around ! I like it so much :) She has her own way acing acads a large part of which along with her intelligence involves following the american clock with certain deviation ! I wonder how she manages to do it ! She is such a multitalented person , brilliant at artwork and has a nightingale like voice .I know she will always remain cheerful as a bird and will reach newer skies in whatever she will do :) Let the good times remain for ever

<p>okay....finally to write the testimonial which was long long due...gargi biswas... :) hands down my best bud in BITS goa, the start of this friendship, was however, pretty whaky....I met Gargi during my workshops in the first year...and to cut a long story short from the moment i cracked my first joke and got her talkin....i dint leave any chance to show off in front of her...be it with my ingenious filing skills or my wondrous pipebending skills....Its been almost 3 years since the day i first met her, and i am still showing off :)...and gargi the awsome person she is, still keeps it coming wid the same mischievious smile as always. and i must say its been an awsome three years ...the daily strolls arnd the campus at nite...gazing at the sky and figurin out where the fuck did orion vanish following that android of yours...or you trying to figure out 'who abheek actually is?' using your expert knowledge in astrology....gargi i am goin to miss it all. And thats the reason my friend, why i cant drag a fight wid you for more than a day or two...its cause i start mising your company too much :). Its awsome arguing wid you about how 'awsome' physics is, or how its cooler to be a 'girl' than a 'guy'...i hope you do realize i always had a an alterior motive - to get you all worked up  cause its too much fun seein you make a point wid vigorous hand gestures and those big eye.... :). You are the most genuine person i have met in the campus, and thats wat is your most attractive trait. she gives more than 100% in any relationship, and wen the road gets tough she can damn well knock some sense in your head if need be. :) dont ever change that abt yourself. I wont say i wish u good life n health n blah blah....i will say those stuff personally everyday, cause like i always say am stickin arnd and nt goin anywhere, am not that easy to shake off. Thanks for keeping me properly fed during these last three years, those brownies are the only things which kept me sane(wid a lil help from u off course :P).Keep rockin always, the orange bouncing bunny that you are (come on, i had to say it once =) ).
Cheers!
