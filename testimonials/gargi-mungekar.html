<p>Gargi.. the apple of my eye.. the light of my life… and … I may go on and on u noe.. <3  Its always been so much fun being around you. Your carefree attitude binds me to you all the more and also the way you value friendship. You have been ‘the friend’ when I have needed one . Your patience , affection and yet openness astonishes me and infact amuses me. I had never seen my alter ego before  ? and that too endowed with the qualities which I aspire to have… now since I can go on and on in this mode, lets cut it short. :P Straining to remember first time I met you..my memory fails me.. It seems you were always so adorable to me :P . u know ‘mera tujhse hai pehle ka naata koi ‘ ..  You are one of the sharpest, bindaas creatures on earth. May Lord uproot all the problems of your life and bring in only happiness in  your life. Now that there are only a handful days left with you, lets live every moment. The fact that we may not meet again brings a tremble . But since memories are to be cherished and not missed , I am very sure my name will always bring up a smile on your face becoz so  does your name to me . Stay in touch .. n Love you forever. <3<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>as much as my hand itches to write a foot long accolade, ill hold myself back and just say this. if it weren't for you, i would have dropped out of this place this place long ago and be on my way to a cooking school or something like that (i don't know, really).  a few dozen little puppies, really long gossips, sporadic night walks, the ghastly exams. wholesome, isn't it? a certain bunch of a-holes, every bitchy smirk, every mean jibe. shown every1 their places haven't we?  how uncanny is it that every single time, we wanted to do the same thing. or that we had the same opinion of everyone! its not chance that we ended up as sidies, its divine providence! Gargi, my dear! where wud i be without you?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>

I first met Gargi (called gargeshwari or gargles or gaars  :D :D not bcoz I like those names, but bcoz she started calling weird names… I had to counter attack :P) in C-mess in the very beginning of 1-1.. I think she was the first MM girl I met and I was glad I can talk to someone in Marathi! She is a black-belt in Karate (have only heard about it, she never demonstrates :P) She loves animals (specially dogs) and cares about them a lot! I remember her buying biscuits from shop-co just to feed the dog… On my first bday after joining BITS (it comes in vacation), gargi had called and she was talking about someone “He likes this, he hates that…” I thought she had younger brother (who I dint knw abt) and it turned out she was talking about her pet Shiro :P :D She is quite adventurous (!!) She doesn’t hesitate to give honest opinion about anything…  A cool minded (never really saw her tensed up), relaxed (always in room :P) and mature girl… Be as you are! All the best, gargi.mungekar! :P :P

<p>Gargi, a driven and a fun girl, open on matters of heart, craziness and desire. Our thoughts, negotiations and opinions have comfortably filled our gtalk conversations. Being able to disagree, argue, advise and occasionally chide, are few qualities of her being. Gargi has the ability to evolve in an environment and add her own colours to it. She is intelligent enough and determined to provide ends to desires she is passionate about. She has a characteristic ability to adjust carefully and let go off! at times. This makes her surprisingly adventurous and challenging. She is an understanding and a thoughtful person, ready to help her mates in times of need. Gargi is at her best, when she knows what she wants, which includes want of good taste in all spheres of her life. When we talk, it’s always about what we are, and not what anyone would want us to be. It’s been pleasure to know you, Gargi. Never cease to be the way you are !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-kapoor">Anubhav Kapoor</a></p>
<p>GARGI!!!!... she was the first person i met from BITS..infact met her even before i came to the campus.. what a coincidence that was!! u were sitting just next to me in train...and till Madgaon station we did not even realize we were going to the same place!
she has been a wonderful neighbour, a great friend and an awesome person.. she was always there by my side... i can always go to her with my problems and she will patiently hear me out and give her valuable advice!
a 'pakka mumbaikar', a big foodie, she is a very fun loving and jolly person....!

<p>I haven't known her for very long... maybe just a year. She is very unique. I haven't heard anyone else speak so frankly about anything before! She is intelligent, hardworking yet lazy (:p) and will go to any extent to lend a helping hand when you need it(Even when she asks for help, she usually ends up helping you instead!). She also likes to scare people with her pranks sometimes (I have been a victim once! and haven't repaid her for it [yet :D]). Wish I knew her better. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Gargi! We've been friends like since 1-2. But of course, we had our share of fun in the two years that followed! The first thing that I noticed in her was this sparkle in her eye and the jolly attitude! I somehow never felt any tension discussing even the most serious things with her, especially when it came to acads n CDCs. Of course, exchanging lab codes has been a regular affair!!! :D
Smart, helpful, friendly, optimistic, enthusiastic, lazy (:P) and yes, an undercover PETA activist is what Gargi is!! Don't dare to poke fun at any animal when she's around. She has this ability to bond with animals pretty well and knows how to handle even the craziest looking creature! She has the audacity to speak up what she judges to be true and that (though sometimes on the face :P ) makes her unique!! Her lively nature is infectious and certainly helps you get over a bad day's ruins within minutes after talking to her, especially if it is right after exams! My discussions with her often end up being funny, with a pinch of variety and of course having her express her love for animals! :P
One of the best memories is that of the epic dinner that u, me and Supriya had! Hours on did we spend poking fun at each other, passing random comments on random people and yes we laughed endlessly on the silliest things , not realizing that more than half the college had gone home! :D
Looking forward to 'epic' discussions when we meet again! Be your adventurous self always!! Way to go!! All the best in all your future endeavours! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
