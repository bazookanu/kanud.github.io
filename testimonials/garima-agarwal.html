<h1 class="page-title">Garima Agarwal</h1><p>Garrrrrriiiiiiiiii, 
From random night outs to epic gossip sessions. All are price less memories. Still remember that awesome bday bash you and saboo planned. From your hindi to your epic room.  I miss all. I am glad we became such great friends here. Alot of things have changed since first year. But the fun quotient when we hang out will always be there. All i wanna say is I am glad that we met, have some awesome memories. I will definitely miss you next sem.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Garima! I have so many things that i want to write for u but my thoughts are running faster  than i can type. I dont know where to start..i think you are a wonderful person. you are caring and understanding and always someone i feel i can share with and connect to. You are amazingly talented and good at so many things! and i really really respect you for that, i guess thats why u scare me too at times :P you have always been there when i needed a friend the most and thats what makes you really special to me. I will always remember studying together, walking around campus, watching dexter and touch and other random series, late night movies in my room, joking..UNO and poker, doodle jump n fruit ninja...and not to mention our EEEP assignment! coding together for DSA and OS, and other pathetic assignments as well. looking back i can only remember good times, i cant think of anything that went wrong. And yes, you are one really REALLY funny person, u make me laugh all the time n i just love that about you! always be this way, i hope to see the same Garima in the future too because u hold a very special place in my heart just the way you are.... :)

Last but not the least you are my cool and not so senti buddy( high5 for that :P, trust me i love that about you). Hope to meet you in future.

<p>Gariii!!! where do i even begin. I used to think that i was a really good dancer but the first time i saw you dance, i was like WOW!..now that's what you call a good dancer! You are just brilliant and i've always tried to become as good as you. We've been together in the club, together in almost all our dancer, we've been away from the club together, and i've loved every moment with you. Zephyr was one amazing time when we actually became good friends. All the bitching and manipulating :P And then 3rd year, when we became friends outside the club as well. All the UNO we played till 4 in the morning, taking avni's case, gossipping all night long, n sleeping all day long, they've all been so special cause of you. you've been so amazing and patient with me, listening to me every night when i needed someone to talk to. I couldn't have got through these last couple of weeks without you.. Garima Agarwal I LOVE YOU! always have, always will! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>gariiiiiiiiii!! bahut garbad ho gaya baba!! :P 

tumhe jo maine dekha, tumhe jo maine jana..
itna samajh gaya hum, ki mushkil hai tumko kuch bhi samjhana..
qualities to tumme bhari hai khoob..
amazing ho dancer aur coding mein nahi noob.. :P
tumne saath diya hamara pyar ke saath..
aur hamari hindi ko kar diya barbad.. 
yaad rahega vo din jab hum saath mein chillaye the..
dil ke arman sab us din bahar nikal aaye the..
sabse jyada bigadi thi jab tum college mein aayi..
aur hum sabke bholepan ki kar di tumne safai.. 
gari hum hai bahut lucky ki tum ho yahan hamare saath..
bahut miss karega tumko, bahut karega yaad..
bas yeh kehena baki hai - i love you so much..
yeh kehene ki zaroorat nahi - always keep in touch.. :)

take care.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/avni-goyal">Avni Goyal</a></p>
<p>Omg, we should have met before this semester! It's been awesome! (Must have been really awesome if that word applies to a CN-related thing) But seriously, I have really begun to admire you after spending this time together. Not only are you like the Code Ninja (Sometimes it seems like the programs must be thinking 'Aah! Garima is debugging! Shit Shit Shit I have to behave myself!'...If that makes sense) but your patience - with frazzled team mates and with impossible errors - and composure - even in horrible CN-induced situations - is really amazing. (Sorry if that's a weird thing to compliment someone on, but it really stands out). So. Yes. You've been a really fun person to hang out with :-) Also, your Hindi is super-adorable!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>
<p>Garima! You're always so calm, and sensible and smiling and so nice nice! I have never seen you even remotely angry, you're such a sweetie!! :D And I simply love you cute bengali accent. Also I still remember your first year waves performance and I just couldn't take my eyes off you! I'm sure you are the most perfect any girl can possibly get. Do stay in touch. Keep smiling! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
