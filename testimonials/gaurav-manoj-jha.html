<p>Gaurav Manoj Jha aka GMJ is one of the most presentable person I have ever seen. Everytime you see him, he will have calmness and composure visible clearly on his face. He is one of the best speakers and a really good coordinator. The best thing about him is his ability to convince people and not just by imposing his ideas onto them but to make them understand how it is good or bad for them. He is a very social person and he can almost talk till eternity about almost anything and everything especially food! I would advice everyone not to talk to him when you are hungry because the way he will describe a recipe and its aroma, your mouth wouldn't be able to hold your hunger any longer :P He is a great cricketer. I still remember his power sixes over the AH6 in second year. "Dhai Kilo Ka Haath..." :P I wish him a great and successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>I got to know him 4 years ago while writing one of those FIITJEE exams and we started talking when we discovered that we were from the same school in Dubai. Much later we discovered that we share a very strange common history which dates back around 17 years ago. We happened to be classmates in Jr. Kg.. Starting with KG, a little gap in between and then middle school followed by and here were again in the same college.

His writing skills are simply amazing. I remember reading one of the testimonials written for him long long ago. It was written that he is a lexicographer. Quite true I must say. He is capable of using such words which might require you to use a dictionary. I had to a few times.

I wish him all the best for his life ahead. Let's see where all we land up together further in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-yegnamurthy">Neha Yegnamurthy</a></p>
<p>GMJ _/\_ A decent, talkative economics pro who is extremely confident about himself. He knows what he wants and will try to convince you relentlessly until you get his point. A social outgoing guy who can easily talk to people. A great speaker and a good cricketer. Dude I wish you all the best and a great life ahead.

<p>Gaurav- The most helping, down-to-earth person one can ever find. I have known him for more than 2 years, he has always been so helping, caring. I would ping him randomly at times for some suggestions and he will leave all his work to help me out. Thats Gaurav!! I am pretty sure not to find a more humble and beautiful person than him. May you achieve all success in life and be the top-most Economist  :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>

<p>Gaurav aka GMJ is a very calm and down to earth person. I have never seen him stressed at any time and he excels in whatever he likes. Me and Gaurav also share the same music interest and have also recorded a few songs - gaurav singing and me playing d guitar. He is very helpful and has a vast knowledge of Economics. He is also a fantastic speaker and can impress anybody with his communication skills. I wish him all the best for future! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Gaurav is a good singer, has a good taste in music(imho), will help you whenever you need it. He coordinated well with us during zephyr and im really grateful for that! He also has the gift of the gab, so moments of awkward silence are usually absent when he's around :D

<p>Gaurav is an great senior, friend and brother. He is someone who will always be there whenever you need help or advice. He is wonderful speaker, who can talk to anyone, about anything! Oh, he sings and whistles really well too! You can never be bored when he's around. He is also one of the most patient people i have ever met. Gaurav was one of the first seniors I interacted with, and im glad that i got to know such an awesome person. I keep pinging him randomly and he actually takes the trouble to reply to everything i say, however busy he is. :P Also, Gaurav has worked really hard to make MATRIX what it is today and has been an amazing president, someone we all look up to. :) 
I wish him all the best for his future. Stay in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/riya-">Riya </a></p>
<p>Gaurav is an awesome guy, extremely down to earth and a rare talent. Very good orator, pro in Eco subjects and a very reliable friend and bf ( i believe so ;) ) Very committed to his work in club and depts and good at managing people and time. He helped me discover some great songs and i thank him a lot for instilling my taste in good music. I love talking to him and admire his frankness about any issue. We have had some great sensible talks in NC and i must say this before i forget, he sings well :D .. and well ofcourse hes a loveguru _/\_ ( gave me some useful tips :D) .. You have no idea perhaps but i must say i should learn so many qualities from you. I have NEVER and i mean it, never seen him getting angry at anyone which makes me wonder HOW!!! 

you are a remarkable guy and a rare friend. I wish all the best for your future and hope to see you just the way you are as of now.. i will miss you buddy :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amrit-mann">Amrit Mann</a></p>

<p>I have always had immense respect for those people who show courage to take the initiative and Gaurav happens to be one among st them. I distinctly remember you walking into harsh's room right at the beginning of our second year, the sheer zeal and passion with which you spoke had a great impact on me and less did i know that, that one meeting would result in we sharing a memory that both of us will cherish for many more years to come and that memory is MATRIX :) The meetings, the discussions, the planning all that went into matrix was incredible. But one thing that stood out was the way you lead MATRIX in our 3rd year. The number and the quality of the events speak for themselves. What also was commendable was the way you inspired the juniors to work along and that's a trait of a true leader. I wish someday i could incorporate the leadership skills you exhibit. 
Apart from that you always came about to be a mature person who had wonderful insight into things. Oh and both of us share a common passion for speaking. We love talking for long time :P In the end I'l say that its your professionalism and a no nonsense attitude that I truly admire and if given a chance i would love to work along side you in the future because i know with you around, things start happening and they start happening in the best possible way :)  wish u all the best for future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-kawley">Ishan Kawley</a></p>

<p>Gaurav is 1 of my neighbors here in BITS. Always looks calm or relaxed. A big fan of music. I hear music on in his room almost the whole time. Talks a lot about the singers and bands. He himself can sing very well. Always starts studying very early :P and he has a lot of interest in economics especially (his branch). He also likes to take initiatives and follow through them properly. Will always help in anyway that he can. A very social person, a great speaker and friend. It was a pleasure being your neighbor. Best of luck with your future, You will definitely reach great heights!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
