<h1 class="page-title">Gauri M Mangalgiri</h1><p>In a world where most people try to be what others want them to be, GMM is a delightful exception. Never fazed by anything and comfortable in her own skin, Gauri is a true example of what you can be if you be who you are. A little geeky, a little round eyed and a whole lot adorable, she lives in a world where ACK is god and MEMS are candies, where classical music is her background score and physics is her staple! If you are lonely, if you need someone to talk to or simply need someone to share a coffee with, she will be there for you. And that makes her, not only a wonderful friend, but an amazing person too.
These three years have been crazy Gauri! From celebrating your JEE birthday to sharing awesome moments on amazing road trips, it's been a whole lot of fun and more!
Good luck girl! You are one of the stars!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>She belongs to an extremely rare category of girls who care more about their projects and assignments than other girly stuff... she is just so very comfortable in being who she is... The people she likes are almost always decided by their qualifications.. except ofcourse RPJ :P  She is extremely blunt when it comes to some things she doesn't approve of but then this is what makes her special.. her no nonsense attitude makes her an extremely trustworthy person... The never-say-die attitude has earned her many laurels and will continue to do so.. You are one heck of an awesome friend Gau .. I've enjoyed your company a lot....Best of luck in life and don't you dare forget me after you realize your LA dreams ! Enjoy :)

<p>Gauri is one of the most down to earth and original persons I have met in BITS. There are so many qualities of her which makes you fall in love with her instantaneously. Firstly, she is super smart and intelligent. She has a JEE rank more than all of us and is really enthusiastic with her projects and "Hi fi" acads stuff. Apart from the brains, she has a keen interest in music and has a really sweet voice herself ! She is really a delight to hang out with :) If at all we are bored or just simply need to talk to someone, she is ever present and always ready to join in for a cup of coffee at mongis. All this combined with her straight forward and positive approach towards life, makes her one of the treasured friends I have made in BITS. Im sure she will achieve all the goals she has set for herself :) Best of luck and do stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>

<p>Gauri : someone who lives in a world of physics with all her Hi-fi projects. She is one of the few persons who rarely cares whatever people thinks of them, and why not!! She herself is such an amazing person, from being super smart, intelligent to such a down to earth person, a friend who everyone want to have. No matter what time I call her, she is always ready to help. We both have a common crush- my little study table, and trust me, she can kill me for it. Her never say die attitude is inspirational. These are only a drop in the ocean of her qualities. I wish her all the best for future and pray that she achieves all her goals and dreams :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Dedicated, intelligent, knowledgeable and more importantly, willing to learn. Her confidence and the way she carries herself is admirable. I remember the first time we spoke was in cc just before our Workshop online quiz. But we came to know together well during the mt2 labs. Its always fun working with you in labs, given the fact that then i can relax and let you do all the work :P. Mostly calm and composed, your are ever willing to help, not just your friends but anyone who asks. Its been great knowing you and after 2 sem of physics CDCs together, we have got 2 more sem of ENI CDCs and m sure, they will be as enjoyable as the first 2. All the best for your future plans and keep going the way you do. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>One of the better people I have known in campus, Gauri is an amazing person. She has always been super busy and very successful with her projects. Her passion for MEMS and whatever she is interested is inspirational. Wish you all the success in life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sourav-banerjee">Sourav Banerjee</a></p>

<p>I would rather call her GG, not GM. Godlike Girl. From working till late night in the optics lab (& then goes to EWB meetings after that!) to her new canvas, as she puts it, RF and MEMS, she has done more projects just this year alone than what I had in my entire 4 years. Add to that, internships every year (right from 1st year!) and the crowning one, Fraunhofer this summer, I am simply awed by her. [No wonder rsp was confused and asked what you are interested in & if it is management side :P But seriously, how do you manage all of this stuff?]. 
She is very inquisitive and always willing to learn new things. I was lucky to work on my mmp computational project with her (and enjoy watching she and Surbhi fight over silly things :P ), I ended up getting the highest marks [Yes, the stuff which you did was really great & you deserved more marks]. But projects aside, (whoa! did anyone notice? just describing her projects took up this much space :P ) she is a true friend one can always count on. Always willing to help. She has a powerful voice, literally! I must say, I was a bit intimidated in the beginning when she used to questions in the class :P  It's interesting to watch her speak to her mom on the phone. Nevertheless, all this made my physics cdc year very lively and fun. Needless to say, you'll soar high in the sky. My best wishes with you always. – Nisheeth

<p>Gauri can stand as an inspiration to all aspiring scientists. Her pure joy in learning and her zeal for research are refreshing to behold. Once she commits to a project, she pours her heart and soul into it, and never shows any resentment, no matter how great the workload. She embodies the true spirit of a scientist. But apart from all these things, she's such a fun person to hang out with. From her multilingual tidbits, to her insights on Mumbai life and culture, to her strange rants about certain couples on campus, it's always a good idea to strike up a conversation with her. I'm sure this is just the beginning of an incredibly impressive career for her! All the best, Gauri!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>
<p>Confidence, elegance, simplicity and humility… that summarizes Gauri. I have known her well only since our MUP classes and the physics CDCs we did together. Truly, Gauri is one of those cherished friends I have made during my physics year and she will continue to remain so. She has amazing confidence which reflects in her characteristic way of walking and talking. She is not the bitchy, gossiping types; you can say she is more of an intellectual; genuine and pure hearted, she is always absorbed in her work… I am awed by her literary skills and her determination and dedication in whatever project she takes up. She is also one of those few people who share my love for classical music and old Hindi songs. She is always willing to help and miraculously always seems to have everything you want at any point of time… be it extra A4 size sheets or notes or coffee or a free advice for that matter. Breakfasts, lunches and dinners with her and Surbhi have been some of the most memorable times this year.  The little fights between the two always amused me. All in all, Gauri is a funny, witty, unique, no-nonsense type, smart and hard working person I have met, who has also been such a wonderful company that she has added many more memories to my physics year. Wish you all the best for the future and hope you attain tremendous success in anything you undertake…<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nisheeta-desai">Nisheeta Desai</a></p>

<p>Gauri is one the most amusing people I have met at BITS. She's a batshit crazy nut job from Malad (which is quite far away from Bombay ;-) ). Gauri is so much fun to talk to and she's always trying to learn new languages and makes an effort of sorts to improve her atrocious Gujarati. I am in awe of her dedication and effort towards whatever she picks up. Hope you have a great life ahead. See you around! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-pandey">Tejas Pandey</a></p>
