<h1 class="page-title">Gautam S,Srinivasan</h1><p>Hmm ... Gautam ..!!!  What a dude he is ..!!  A great competitor , a nice frnd , and a practical person is enough to sum it all .. I still remeber the day wen we first met .. It was our common room , when you were playing _/\_ carrom from hrs and only the opponents were getting up to get a chance to play on that board .. That's when i first heard about you ..!! One day i got a chance to play against you ( luckily ) and somehow managed to overplay you .. that match we were surrounded by all the carrom players cheering both of us .. after loosing  all the 2-3 three matches that we played ( my good luck that day ) , your response was .. dude actually I'm a cricket player , carrom to mai bas aise hi khelta hu ...lol ..!!  HAHA ... that was epic.. and then the countless hrs spent on that board will always be cherished ...  My only consistent partner from first year in slam .... will always remember the epic match we played against ah6 ( dixit) in slam finals and we won 25-24 ..!!  That was one heck of a match and we we both supported each other beautifully ..  again a great cricket player you are with a beautiful technique of striking the ball .. It has always been fun to play with you in hostel and CP ..!! You always managed to praise me in whatevr i did .. thanx for that .. although i knew u and omi were flattering me ..!!  It has been very nice to discuss carrom with you all these years and one thing is for sure .. when it comes to all the carrom memories in bits , your name would be very high in the list .. best of luck for future , i KNOW U LL MAKE IT BIG IN LIFE  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
<p>Funny, entertaining and lively are the words when I think of this one-of-a-kind creature. Always takes jokes in good spirit. Your uttering of "Paru" is simply hilarious. It was really a quality time that we spent during TRW and POM presentations. I always enjoyed all your jokes that were cracked on me. In short, it's "Gautam Effect" that makes  the entire hostel the way it is.....People in your vicinity cannot escape The<i>Gautam Effect</i>, ......Finally  I hope you will certainly do something big in life. All the best for all your future endeavours!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>They say some friends are worth everything. Gautam S.Srinivasan, a magnanimous personality with heart of gold, an altruist who can do anything for his friends. On a normal boring start of a new semester, I met this fellow in MT-2 practicals,the very first thought that came into my mind was "Billion Dollar Man", but soon I realized that there was a lot more to him than just being an aristocrat. He is an extrovert,a gregarious person, a very humble personality having immense respect for every other individual. We have had so many crazy moments, literally been the best of friends for more than a year now. Can never forget how his 3-1 ended, how fucked up that day was for him; his recent BRAHMINISM craze, certain CRAZY FUCK thoughts and ideas that he develops once in a while(referring to that "brahmand" like personality in our PPS and how much you used to stare :P), the project struggle which is still going on, our hour-long discussions on any random topic, apeejay discussions, our regular visits to all the food joints in the campus, will miss all these things. Like a true friend you have supported me during all my hard times. Have had so many wonderful memories, we have laughed together, lamented on stupid chemical subjects together. You made my journey through the 3rd year very awesome. And my friend if everything goes well, then PS-II " Mein Phod ke Rakh Denge". All the very best in life dude. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aruj-srivastava">Aruj Srivastava</a></p>
<p>I met in him during our PS1 and I regret the very fact that I didn't meet him earlier. He is an easy going guy and it is always fun to hangout with him. You will definitely love his company. He is an outspoken guy and frank in his manners. He can make friends very easily. He is a great public speaker and debater. He is a good cricket and carom player. I have had some awesome moments with him in Bengaluru which I will cherish throughout my life. He is the kind of guy whom you will remember for a long time. He is a dear friend and I am surely going to miss him. All the best for your life ahead bro. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rajat-koujalagi">Rajat Koujalagi</a></p>
<p>well!! what can i write about him. There aren't enough adjectives in the English dictionary to describe him.He is that good!! Its been a privilege having a person like him as my neighbour. Every moment spent with him has been memorable,although, like many a poor soul i too have been on the receiving end of his countless jokes. However much i resent being the butt of his jokes,i know i'll miss that part the most. If today, i have finally become a less reserved person then the credit goes to him, for some of his extrovert nature has surely rubbed onto me, not to mention that he has an equal hand in increasing my tolerance levels, for i have learnt  the art of enduring 'his' taunts! Whatever said, he is a brilliant person and someone who values friendship a lot. I can safely say that he'll be there for me always, no matter what the situation.i'll surely miss all those times we spent together. wish you all the happiness in the world buddy!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>
<p>Takes jokes in good spirits... smiles even if you make fun of him beyond limits. We chat regularly for time pass... it is fun as this person has diverse knowledge... an extrovert... if we end up debating over some issue, he mostly wins as he approaches everything in a unique way. Keeps watching lot of movies and sometimes asks me for suggestions. A good cricket player... swings the bat in style and manages to beat the hell out of everyone's ball. His otherwise silent corridor comes to life only because of this guy who attracts friends if he stands outside his room otherwise keeps playing some or the other music. Hope to see you sometime in future and all the best. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Gautam and I have bonded since the time we both knew that there were more similarities than differences in our thinking and in the way we wanted ourselves to be in the future. We both sincerely wish to keep having fun and make lasting friendships with almost everyone we meet in our lives. He is that social being you would want to merge your own circle with. He is funny and spontaneous, yet driven and focused at what he wants. Both of us are immensely passionate about suits and luxurious corporate life! He is one of those guys who would work hard and remain consistent to get to the top. He is curious enough to know and remember how much his friends scored in almost all exams since first year (an actual ftp)!!! He is updated about any gossip in the campus and has fun sharing it too. Our occasional hangouts are one of the most memorable moments of my college life. Conversations with him have always been diverse, enjoyable and fruitful, though killing time in every aspect. We are not exactly separating, but I hope our paths keep crossing in the future. I should confess that I once tried knowing myself, and then I thought if I can know you, I would know a bit about myself too. It’s been a fun ride with you, all along. Cheers mate!! Just be the way you are!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-kapoor">Anubhav Kapoor</a></p>
<p>Gautamaa!!! HE is one hell of a story teller...!! :D Just love his narration ... It's like watching a typical bollywood movie with all that masala; and even though they sometimes fail to make sense, you still enjoy listening to them! :D I have put up with Gautam's nonsense for 3 years now...:P (He lives just 3 rooms away) and still sometimes strangely wish for more!!! A multi dimensional Tam-Brahm, he's seen and done a lot of things in life!(Okay. I m not sure of the 'done' part :P) The guy is a SAUDI often going to Dubai to sign checks :D Gautam is a PRO at socializing and I know He's gonna make it BIG one day... It's been great living with you, Wom-kaar and Baar-gavaa :D Gonna miss it nex sem! Wishing all the very best for your great future!! :)

<p>Having Gautam as a friend is a wonderful example of friendship in itself.  Open-minded, genuine, compassionate, and practcal, he can always be counted on to listen and provide support when needed.  His wonderful sense of humor, adventure, and life experiences have given him the ability to see any situation in a positive sense.  Personally believing that ‘people come into our lives for a reason, a season, or a lifetime’,  I’ve known for a long time that he is a lifetime friend.
Fate chooses my relations, I chose my friends.  I am happy with my choice.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/balaaji-mahadevan">Balaaji Mahadevan</a></p>
<p>One of the best friends I have made in college life, hardly i got words to describe him. Starting from our crazy anime to nature documentaries to other wierd stuff there are innumerable things that we have always done together and those memories are sure going to last a lifetime.
He has got one of the most prolific knowledge of english vocab among those i have met and am sure anyone who knows him will feel the same. Apart from his habit of taking nearly an hour to get ready when he has to go outside campus or even to the mess for that matter ( thank god hes gotten away from it this sem, atleast i think so), hes got no other ill points to speak off. A good cricket player and also an exceptional carrom player making him a good sports personality. He carries an aura wherver he goes and people find it irresistible to talk to him and befriend him.

Also last but not the least, the only guy whom i might have criticised more than anyone else in my whole life till now but yet not even once he's become angry for it. I hope all the best for the future and will surely know that hes a legend in the making!

Have fun man!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>
<p>The only good thing chemical engineering has ever done to me is that it gave me Gautam as a friend. He is a very frank fellow who has good terms with almost everyone and a good sportsman... amazing cricketer and unbeatable carrom player. He is a very lively guy and is always ready to take challenges. He said to me once "Jab main tujhse pehli baar mila tha to laga tha ki tu kitna shareef ladka h... aaj pata laga ki tu mujhse bhi bada vaala h :D" Haha.... but honestly tu bhi kucch kam nhi h. Remember, MTO lab me report chura ke copy ki thi :D I will miss those wonderful times spent with you. All the best for your life ahead... I know you will scale heights. Always be in contact dude..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>Gautam! Got to know him from EG lab that we had together. ..initial impression I formed was-“this fellow is quite talkative “ (n that’s quite true :P:P)!  A hardworking, helpful , fun-loving and a good-at heart  person, you can never get bored with him! Was fun working with him during PDD project. Be it those EG lab sessions or the pdd project-library times, it was great knowing you. I wish you all the best for your future endeavours! May you scale heights! Stay in touch :)?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
