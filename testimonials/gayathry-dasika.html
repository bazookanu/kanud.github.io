<h1 class="page-title">Gayathry Dasika</h1><p>Even though we haven't spent a lot of time together, the times I have had with her have been memorable. The Benolim trip remember....what a crazy day it was! She is a very dedicated and strong headed person. From being the mess rep to the Girls convenor, she still manages to be pretty humble, so that is a great thing to learn from her. All the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>A very kind hearted and innocent friend of mine :) Will do the most evil thing also so innocently that you will think hundred times before accusing her!! A very sweet, caring and generous person :)  She is an Awesome Quality control :P ... can break things in minutes :D A Gadget fanatic. An awesome person to hangout with. Had my best outings in BITS with her. A person who totally follows her heart. Once on the correct path, she knows how to keep her feet intact on it. And last but not the least - she is the only person who washes clothes when she is frustrated - be it midnight 12; you can always hear her beating up her clothes ;) Very interested in spirituality; and hence a AOL dudette of campus. Wish you a very best luck for your future :)

<p>Gayathry is a unique person in herself. It's very difficult to meet people like her who are so generous, mature and full of enthusiasm. This girl rejoices each and every activity she is a part of and does everything with full dedication. I remember at around twelve in the night I met her and she told me " Shruti, I am frustrated ! I am going and washing clothes." Lol. That was so cute. Absolutely kiddish at heart and very sportive, she is spiritual and is a total LEO. :P. This girl who used to sit in front of her laptop playing AOE during exam time will be missed so much! I wish you all the luck for the future ! And I am pretty sure that this amazing capability of yours to excel in the field that you are fond of will take you to heights !! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>
<p>Well, i have known her since the first year but we haven't had that much of interaction. But whenever we got a chance to talk, her humble and polite attitude, her knowledge and that silent desire and passion for success is so evident. Just the way she carries herself demands respect and is respected by everyone indeed. You are a very sober person and it was a pleasure knowing you. All the best for times ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>She is the one who is so interested in spirituality... On any day if you are feeling low ,she can cheer you up by telling you spiritual thoughts and make   you see the bright side of life.She is a person who easily mingles and befriends everybody- a quality worth imbibing.Her thoughts are always dynamic.She is always updated with news- be it world news or our campus news :P 
The way she talks is always mature.. She is a connoisiuer of books and very attached to her family . May you have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>Sweet, humble, jovial these are the few words that come to my mind, . I remember our first conversation was on dc,, and then a few more on gtalk before i finally met her in person. She is fun to hang out with, She's a great listener,will listen to your opinion very earnestly before she can give hers. She is an immensely spiritual person. She almost all the times sees the brighter sides of things, be it a bad exam, or a crappy day and that rubs off on others she knows ( it sure did on me).She has a very innocent smile,( please don't change that)  All the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>

<p>Gayathry! My oppie for the past 3 years and next year to come as well! I met her on the first day of my arrival on campus as she was leaving her room and I was arriving on mine. Since then I have always thought that she is the bestest oppie one can have. A sweet girlw with whom i have had some really great and humorous moments - be it cracking random jokes or discussing studies and the various problems of the messes :P, etc. I have always had a blast. Gayathry always has great ideas with respect to different things. I cherish those moments when we made music ( !! ) together. She on her synthesizer and me on the guitar. We strummed for hours and that was just one stanza, but i had the bestest time! Her room has the most amazing breeze and she has always offered to share that breeze with me and always told me in the pre-netlon era -  'Namrata keep your door open so that the wind can come into your room'. Her room has this fresh feel to it and devotional songs often heard from there are really peaceful!.... :)
I have always cherished having her live opposite me and one thing I wouldn't be happy for had our hostels changes is that I would have lost Gayathry as my oppie!
I wish you all the very best in everything you do

<p>Mess Rep. Girls Convenor. This girl is a true leader who knows all girls and most boys in the campus. Addicted to DC, i first came to know her as somebody doing daily tp on DC++ and thats it. Finally met face to face in 3-1 as a well mess rep and her dedication towards campus is truly commendable. A true foodie, she can accurately determine what are the ingredients in food prepared. Food sampling were great fun with her. Other than that, her smile is really infectious and she is a real fun to hang out with. Conducting Bio experiments were real fun with her, She really knows her bio! She is exceedingly caring person, i remember she used to wake me up by calling me on fone and gtalk! Also used to constantly advice that I should sleep more :) A recently converted fellow Madridsta and Cristiano Ronaldo fan, I hope to spend 1 more awesome year with you and hang out more (especially during Madrid matches :D)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Though we havn't interacted much, I can still say she is of the most inquisitive, curious person on the campus. A caring and fun loving person with dedication and enthusiasm, and friendly too. 
Hope you have a awesome life and fulfill all your dreams. And it's also a previlege for me too to know you :)
All the Best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>If you start a conversation with gayathri in a few minutes she will gather all the information needed from you in a very skillful and innocent way. She is a very curios, innovative and spiritual person and very kind hearted and always ready to help. She has a very keen interest on the things that she love very much like art of living, BIO and a love towards over environment . I'm happy that she also started following football and is a Real Madrid fan :) I wish her more and more success in the career she pursues. All the best!!

<p>Gayathry!! What do i say about her!!!!! It would not be any exaggeration if i say that she is one of the most unique persons i have met in my life.. She is smart, bold and daring.. She is someone who does not follow crowd but makes her own way to do the things. She is extremely talkative and probably can speak on anything, any topic of this world :P.. She is the one with whom i used to hang out the most in the early days of the campus and i still cherish the memories of that time.. I really see a true friend in her.. She motivates you when you are depressed.. (like as in my case i was depressed coz of my priority no. in 1st year n she showed up and waved her magic wand :P ).. she cares for you.. she helps you whenever you need her.. I really love you so so much gayathry and my life in this campus wouldn't have been the way it is if you hadn't been there :).. She is really very cute in person (this i am writing on behalf of my sister too :P) and a fun loving person who is living her life to the fullest. I wish you a very best ofluck. May god fulfills all your dreams :).. Have a great journey ahead Gayathry :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/barkha-gupta">BARKHA GUPTA</a></p>

<p>Gayathry! She's one person who shows a lot of enthusiasm in learning and doing new things! That is the first thing that brought us together to be good friends. But seriously, the level of enthusiasm and love for life she has deserves respect of its own accord! A friendly, simple and humble, outgoing person with tremendous determination is what you are! Though we met less often after first year, the kind of discussions we've had were really various with spirituality often making an appearance! Of course, she has this streak of Bhakti within, which is reflected in her determination! Simply put, she is this spiritual and mature person with a radiant innocent smile! Keep smiling! All the best in all your future endeavors! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
