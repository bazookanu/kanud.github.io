i still remember our first meeting.!! In the railway station, we were the last ones to get down.!! and i scared u while we were getting to the campus :P i dint mean to :D
Remember how we tried to get our rooms on the same floor.!! how much ever we try to get things common for us, we end up in two opposite ways.!!Nw even though if the CDCs are common u rarely turn up :D 
and our palm reading session in lib..!! :D and how we used to wake up and go to breakfast at 7:30 during the first week.!! (limited only to first week though :P )
u are the cutest, sweetest and the most innocent frnd i cud get.!! srsly.!! how she believes anything u tell her.. and its so easy to trick her..! and thats the fun part.!! got to see her expressions after that.!! Oh God.!! Shes soo damn cute.!!! :D 
She may appear calm, but ull get to knw her real self only if u r close to her.!!
very talented.. and yea tooo lazy to use any of it.!! very creative, but again, laziness covers up all these talents of her, a singer :P a dancer ( :D) and for those who don knw.. she even staged shows.! :D
Little miss fantastic.!! :D
and her smile is soo cute and infectious.. and she is even more adorable when she cries :P remember first year maths exam?? ;)
and yea the girl with attitude ;) u shud get her angry to see this ;)
and a shopaholic.. how much ever she shops, she wouldnt be satisfied.. !
A totally lazy creature... and so a regular customer to shahi.. ;) :D 
But totally interested in stuff like YBI.. to the core..!! 
an easy prey for all our fun..!! :D
the moments spent with u are soo memorable.. be it the stupid talks, or the horror movies, or the night walks behind sac ;) or teasing u :D or anything else.. they are ones to be cherished.!!
i just can keep writing abt miss pretty.! ;) :P :D

<p>hey my frienemy..!!!:P (friend+enemy)The first thing that flashes in mind when everyone thinks of her is her laziness..!!But the first thing that comes to my mind when i think of her is our silly fights on the silliest possible things..!!I love to fight wid her on silly things though some turn up to be a disaster..!!!
She is my cutesttt frnd..!!! :)She is gorgeous,very talented,lazzzyyy.!!! Her cutest actions makes u cheerful(though they are irritating sometimes :P).She has a gr8 grasping power but neva utilises it.She never tells anyone about her talents;she has many like skating,classical dance..etc.She falls for stupid pranks..I can neva 4gt dat SMRC prank.U were so stupid to fall for that :P .It was fun watching u get scared for the silliest possible things.And yeah,U promised me that we will watch a horror movie together.Don't forget.
There are a lot of similar things(many bad things ofcourse) in u n me..the ego factor(:P),not able to express how you feel..etc etc 
Sorry for hurting you sometimes.I never had any intention to hurt you.I Just wanted you to be happy and not careless.Only thing i wanted to say is don't be so fickle in taking decisions about future.U may not get a gud and caring friends(:P) as u got here..Learn to take care of yourselves and be strong..LOve you..!! :-*<3 And yeah,lets rock next sem..!!!Lets do all the things vch are meant to be done in a crazzyyy college lyf!!!! :):D --ur frienemy pranathi :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranathi-reddy-mandadi">Pranathi Reddy Mandadi</a></p>
