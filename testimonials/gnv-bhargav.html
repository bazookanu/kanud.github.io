<h1 class="page-title">GNV Bhargav</h1><p>Bhargav!! The first thing that comes to my mind is "Sachin (Tendulkar obviously) Bhakt"...i mean seriously a bhakt...he probably knows more about sachin than  sachin himself ;)....
hes an awesome mathematician...cant forget some of the discussions we have had on certain problems.....one of the very few good friends i found on campus... : )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sontakke">Vishal Sontakke</a></p>
<p>Kira! That's how I know him (it is his DC nick). One hell of a guy, really good at chess and very passionate about Mathematics. Kira is one of the friendliest people I met on campus. I had a blast with him as a co-admin on Titan. Will miss him a lot next year :)
No bye here, we'll stay in touch! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>A very helpful and selfless person, interested in practical knowledge and exploring new methods. One of the best downloaders on DC. Always cool and fun loving.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankeerth">Sankeerth</a></p>
<p>The funny man of the group.One conversation with him and you would be his fan.During the third year ...our conversations were basically about cursing EEE/ENI and making jokes about the profs..(Bhargav is a huge fan of Bacher and Reddy and has given very insightful views about them  :D :D ) .A source of  outrageous opinions and ideas. Watches anything and everything ...Has recommended very good shows  and movies which I got addicted to. A mathematics wizard and an awesome cricketer. The biggest Sachin Fan. One of the Gods of Titan (Kira ....). An ever-entertaining Friend  and one of the best friends I made on the Campus. All the best and have a happy and a successful life. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>Fun is synonymous with him.He has the knack of making people laugh by spontaneously dishing out the most hilarious one liners.His room was always a refuge, when i needed some cheering up.This dude is a fun factory. He is really good academically and is very passionate about mathematics. He may appear geeky but he is a walking and talking encyclopedia on movies, cricket, tennis, football and the list goes on. The amount of knowledge he has about most of the things is just astounding.He shares the same ardent passion for Tendulkar and though we have our own favourites when it comes to tennis, i'll miss his company while watching those matches. I can't quite assimilate all my thoughts in this one testimonial,for he is so much more! stay the way you are buddy!! wish you all the happiness!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>
<p>Kiraaaaaaaa!!!!!!  One of the most popular guys in the campus. I didn’t interact much with him in the first year ( which i regret ) because his blaring sound system made me think he is arrogant :P...........but on the contrary,he is too simple and humble.
He has a child like innocence and a heart of gold.........has the ability to make every1 and ne1 laugh :D............Also a brilliant orator i feel ( wait till you hear his sarcastic and witty comments in his own peculiar tone :D).
What makes Bhargav special is that he voices his opinions(howsoever wierd they may be :P)  openly w/o thinking what other people might think of him.
His working knowledge of mathematics and computers is just amazing.
He is overall also good in studies ( because Phd students in the campus ask him doubts :P)
A pro-downloader ( but doesn’t download australia’s highlights :P ) and the no of movies that he watches is unbelievable.
He is undoubtedly the biggest sachin tendulkar fan that i have met in my life......i have a feeling ( and i hope i am wrong ) that this guy will stop following cricket the day sachin retires .?

There is hardly any doubt in that you are going to make it big in life.....all the best for your future.
CHEERS!!! For being such a wonderful friend ?

<p>Bhargav aka kira... Another one of a kind person i know in my hostel. Its really hard to understand at times what is he thinking. We haven't had much interaction in these years but got to know him while playing cricket and this sem in the Semiconductors course. He is quite excited at times for various things that he likes. There always seems to be something going in his mind. Is quite passionate about the things he do or likes. Is fun to hangout with most of the times :P But all in all a very decent fellow who cares about his friends and is ready to help them in whatever way necessary. Wish you all the best mate. Take care and god bless...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Bhargav or rather kira as he is popularly known, is the funniest guy I have ever come across. He has an inimitable quality to crack witty (intentional/unintentional) remarks on almost anything and everything. His sharp wit and even sharper tongue will have you in fits in no time. One can never have a dull moment with him. But for all his sarcasm and funny one-liners he is an extremely sensible person and has many layers to his persona. Once you get past his often unintentional sarcastic remarks, you can see how awesome this guy is. Although, his greatest quality is his openness. He is extremely amiable and friendly, and can be friends with anyone in a matter of minutes. He has a deep love for mathematics, and Sachin Tendulkar. He is an expert downloader and has been one of the greatest admins on DC. You will always find him ready for a ride out of the campus. There have been many a bike rides with him around Goa and every one has been epic. He also happens to be a fellow anime lover, and one of the best friends I made in BITS :D. 
<p>
Here's a toast to all the trips in Goa, the infinite amount of time spent discussing chudaap at your room, all the anime and movies watched, to the climb up that fort, to bike rides, to the underarm crickets, to all your hilariously and often unintentionally witty sarcasms and one-liners, and of-course to hulk ;). Best wishes mate, and always stay in touch :).	
<p>
P.S :  Stay the way you are, that's why people love you :D.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
