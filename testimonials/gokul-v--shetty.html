<p>Goks for some folks!!,  but friends call him Shetty as if he owns A mess :P. He is a dear friend of mine .I met him in the first semester at first he was all taking in English in an accent but when we bonded , i came to know the desi gokul. Since then we've been hanging out on numerous occasions whether it is my first trip in bits to netrawali where we both were wondering are we in group or alone.Of course goks had many special friends there (names not to mention :P) and the memorable trip to Bangalore where we  had an awesome time coz both of us were knowing the city (yeah he also didnt knew much about it :P). He introduced me  to the world of movies and from where there was no looking back. He is smart(probably the smartest of my friends),witty,he has this all time laughing face which sometimes put him in  awkward situations (actually his face is like that only :P), kiddish looks as if he is aloof in this world.Least bothered about what's going around in other lives , but when it comes to friends he is always there. He never cared about academics and pursued his interests.He loves physics, table tennis ,movies (ob),updated on current issues,great taste in music too.I can go on and on, goks is a special friend to me and will always be, with your coolness and determination every dream of yours will come true and you have all the potential in you to make it big!!! All the best goks!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-ahuja">vishal ahuja</a></p>
