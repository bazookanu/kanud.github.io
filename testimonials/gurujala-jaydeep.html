<p>Jaydeep- One of the very few I absolutely admire in my department. He's as cool as cool things go. Never ever attends a class, still scores like hell ( and the ideal guy for predicting quizzes) . With a perfect carefree attitude that goes hand in hand with his delightful personality, he's one of the best guys I know on campus. With his destination so perfectly pictured in his heart, I know that he will achieve great things in his life. Good luck for your future :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishnu-prasad">Vishnu Prasad</a></p>
<p>first time when I saw you..thought you were a rowdy..  den as time passed we became close. U cared for me like a guardian ... The way u see things,the way u want to change them ,the way u take actions really inspires me..bt i dont get one thing.. you bunk classes ..study just a day before and score a min of Av+20.. how do u do that?
anyway I am glad that i got a friend like u.. congrats in advance for getting into to ISB( im sure that u ll crack it) All the best for your future..!!!

<p>first of all, i am really jealous of u. it's because of ur cg and marks and u (as u say) study just 1 day b4 xam and manage top scores. i am sure u r very intelligent and talented but still d fact remains same. u always think negatively both about urself and others. it's d best thing about u because u correct them in u urself and also try 2 correct them in ur friends (even when they take it negatively sometimes :P). u r an all rounder and can do nything u want including sports, cultural activities and what not. ur dreams are big and i am sure u will acheive them. u r a caring person and u try to guide all ur friends and a gr8 person to be hanging around with. all d best for ur future. keep rocking \m/.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krishna-murthy-b">Krishna Murthy B</a></p>
<p>guruvu gaaru, seriously this guys is kul , i mean i never believed what every1 said until i actually got close to him. he is a very analytical in his approach and does things very methodically. i like his thought process and the way he perceives things. i really admire ur focus on career and the care u take to shape it perfectly. i sincerely wish u enjoy everything u do and achieve everything u aimed .. stay in touch always  :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>"Jaydeeeeeeeeeeepppp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" we cried in unison when asked by a senior that who was the topper among us..Yes buddy I am proud to be your friend.This guy has a special talent-"INTELLIGENCE". Infact, this is completely true but sad because only both of us share this gift among all of us...:D ;)......A big fan of Chelsea, where about two days ago we fought for our teams.......To be frank, he is da most kind hearted person and a food freak I am aware of. He is always helpful and approachable but a bit of a pessimist at times, though this behavior of urs had always entertained me when u and others keep arguing.Its very nice to see u playing fifa and swearing at the programmers for the fault of ur players...:P . I think these praises will motivate u to write a bit positive about me in my testimonial ( if u write any..;))....Anyways a cute boy with an amazing talent of perception with a blend of humor and sarcasm along with a pinch of friendliness.Take my word buddy, u can make an amazing director by the way u describe things. Enjoy lyf to the fullest. Wish u luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/j-harish">J Harish</a></p>
<p>Finally getting a chance to speak about my guru garu....of course the first 3 sems i used to see him very less as i was mostly in ah-4.....but ppl used to talk a lot about his marks ,his acads and i really wanted to meet him and talk to him....we kind of knew each other from second sem....and he also taught a few of my one night batting subjects....it was because of him i made out of those subjects in compre with ease.....big thanks for dat :)).....and from the 4th sem it was every birthday party in cp , every b'day outing it was all fun....every weekend cricket, me and him being in same team and his left hand batting when he is back to form is a treat to watch(believe me it's a treat :D).....he is so confident....i wonder how he gets such amazing ideas regarding management concepts, start-ups,....and do remember me if u start anything i will be ur first employee in dat :))......he's got so many ideas about everything and hope they all turn out to be as the way he wanted to do them......i will surely stay in touch guru garu....all the best for ur future here, in ISB, and everywhere u go..... :) :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bharath-janyavula">bharath janyavula</a></p>
