<h1 class="page-title">Gururaj Rao</h1><p>Fun and frolic loving, this guy can make anyone smile with his his infectious laughter and humorous speaking style. However let not his superficial overtly large smile fool you. He is dexterously intelligent and highly versatile (given his free-lance writing skills). Will work his ass off to complete any goal he has set for himself. Will always remember him for his humongous laughter bursts, fastidious nature and perhaps the cleanest possible room that he maintained in BITS Goa.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Guru is one of the most whimsical guys I have met. He often takes irrational decision and more often goes back on them trying to provide justification to the irrationality. He has huge ears. Ok, I don't know if this fact has any bearing on my opinion of Guru. He is one cheap bastard to put it mildly. Can smell a treat a mile away. Vignesh always being his scapegoat. Likes to drive a lot. Oh yeah, he is really into MBA stuff, dreams of being a great manager someday. Ok, so inspite of his various (and one particular) "short"-coming (Sorry, couldn't help !) I'll always remember Guru for his epic laughs and the panic attacks he gets when insects enter his room (He offered me Rs.100 once to get rid of a moth from his room) .

<p>A person who above all is afraid of insects. He knows which lectures to attend (the ones with surprise quizzes :P). He is going to be a great manager I believe. If anyone wants to make money then he should probably open a PIZZA shop in front of Guru's house.I won't be able to forget his laughs and his epic logic. I will always remember his clean room and his backup plans if an insect enters his room. But overall a cool guy, a cool friend..(with huge ears :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Gururaj and his pearls of wisdom have made my stay at BITS epic! His irrational logic defies all common sense and yet one cant help but love him. An aspiring manager, he has all the qualities to be one, the only vice being laziness. This fear for insects and love for pizzas are the two things about him I can never forget.
This guy is always happy, laughing and joking around, his wise cracks without fail make me laugh and once literally roll on the floor. This guy is desperate for free stuff and will do anything to avail a treat.
 Love him or Hate him, you simply cant ignore this guy.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>My PS1  wouldn't have been the same without this  guy. A really fun guy to hangout with. He never fails to make me laugh not always because i find his jokes funny :P ,its just that once he starts laughing there is little u can do but join in. A huge fan of pizza hut (especially if its a treat). Overall an awesome guy to be around.Hope u all the best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>Gururaj Rao - Technically speaking we are distant relatives, but that we came to know only once we were here. This lanky Arsenal fan to my memory has not a match of Arsenal be it exams or anything. Also never missed out an opportunity to have Pizzas! Though not so generous he always meant good to people. He is that person in group who if present there will always be laughter and joy around(mostly because of people taking his case:P). Thanks guru for making life in campus memorable, and hope you achieve your goals in life!!
Cheers and All the Best!!

<p>Guru , popularly known as Chindhi is well known for his ridiculous theories. He will use his best efforts to save money in every every possible way and then spend all of that saved money on a pizza. Apart from having his own hypothesis on a number of things, he is known to take irrational decisions and then some more irrational decisions to back them up. He is very scared of insects. A cool guy to hangout with ,  I can never forget the countless days we've spent strolling in Vasco , Panjim or elsewhere. (though you haven't come in 3-2!!) He is a very sincere , dedicated and a hardworking guy who aspires to become  a top manager in the world. I have no doubts that this is just about round the corner. It has been my pleasure to know you and have you as my friend. All the best for the journey ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
<p>Gandu!! One of my best buddies on campus.....crazy, whacky, self ragger, chooza, chindi, rich freak, dumb freak what all can I say about Ganduraj that hasnt already been said. Guru has got to be one of the funniest persons to be around (and by that I mean laughing AT him). We've been through "Sophrad" together and now with "F&P" and both experiences have shown a more professional, focused and industrious side of him. Good luck for the future, Gandu and lets hope we make F&P big!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>Chindi!!!! Firstly, wat a pic dude!!!! A true filmstar look....:P 
Guru has been and will always be one of my best friends on campus. He is a big Arsenal fan (also plays Fifa '12 with Arsenal big tym) and a real fattu, given the way he screams seeing any insect!!!! He is a guy who is born to do MBA and be a manager of a big organisation....but having said that he also phodofied his Mech CDCs (being called the CDC King after Sukrut). He always keeps his room clean (he once told me he cleans it 10 times a day!!!!). His laughter is infectious and he is a real cool guy to hang out with!!!! We'll stay in touch surely.....Hope you have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Guru, chindi, nanhi and nano! All point to the interesting traits that he possesses, except for the phattu part, which is evident in his actions all the time! :P
Lives opposite to my room, but never opens the door(one of the cleanest rooms on campus though)  while I sweat it out in the scalding heat of my room! Helping nature?? Not one bit! But the insects are to be blamed for the same, For, there is this theory that goes on to say that insects have threatened him for life that if he'd turn helpful to anyone, they would do a mass attack one night and go sit in precarious spots in his body to tickle him at the wrong times and make him do strange things! :P
Yeah I was showing off! :P But what I did show off was a skill learnt from the GURU! His body of knowledge is revered by everyone and is fondly called Guruism!
Bluffing like a boss while cleverly concealing pearls of truth within, only to be noticed by those who know- he's simply a pro at that!
Street-smart, clever, intelligent, diligent, friendly (though initially reserved)  and of course freebie freak with a special love for insects( part of Guruism :P )!  We've shared some really interesting moments. The first time I saw you in front of my room, you were up with a straight face not knowing how to respond! As Srini came around, we got you started talking! He's one guy who can do anything to get free stuff and his ideas to get them can at times be annoying! We've shared many a laugh with all kinds of lame jokes! I don't know how I managed to laugh at such horrible jokes. It's probably his characteristic hearty and extended, high pitch (somewhere between a snort and a soprano) laughter that made me laugh! :P
We take digs at each other quite often and his worst prank ever was the Tea thing on Google Buzz! Being an impostor and posting random stuff!  LOL
Quite often when I get out of my room, I get this ' Ah viggy' call from Guru which is promptly returned back with an 'Ah Guru' call! Phodu is a word that got cliched long back in our dictionary. Both of us have shared some secrets bound by a pact that they shouldn't be named/mentioned!! ;)
That apart, his business acumen is impeccable! Not even a Seth (for ages) can challenge him in hisaabs! He does everything ijjat se! He knows how to set goals and achieve them like a pro! Fifa is his drug. At other times he's really hardworking and is committed to his work!
If you know him, you can trust him completely and he'll return you the same gesture! He has no malice at heart and is quite childish at times. He helps those he trusts. His LAN cable is what I;ve been using till date! :P
A great friend to hang out with indeed! I'll surely miss all those funny moments and the sweet memories of all the trips we had and times that we spent together!
All the best in your novel business plans dude! 
You'll be missed! Keep in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Guru aka Guddu aka Chindi aka Kamla ka Hamla(long story...), hes one of the reasons i love my corridor,  random bashing, guru ke saath keede, food at 1 am in the night(okay,whole day), night canteen deliveries, guru has always been center-stage. This guy is a true extremist, if he plays fifa he'll play for five hours straight(often losing to me.. ), if he studies he'll ace courses. He was one of those who gave up studying cdcs, because they were 'too tough' and resorted to studying lowly AAOCs, but come compre, he got av+50s in cdcs and well, Cs in AAOC, never trust AAOC woh kisi ke nhi hote! We have had great times together, the Angrez night, pizza delivery from panjim, viggys treat at pizzeria and the srini bashings in his room, fuddu saala!. Abbe 4-2 ekdum party karenge, ghar se chakna leke aana ! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Hardworking, friendly and a humble person -  these are some qualities he possesses. Although we dont each other personally, but have been sharing many of exam hall jokes before and after examinations. Wish u all the best for your life :) and yes I will definitely say 'yeh mera mech buddy tha :) :) '<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Guru a.k.a. Chindiraj a.k.a Chindi is one of the most unique persons I have come across.And certainly deserves to be in that weird corridor of his. I vividly remember our first meeting- in Srikant's Biology Class, where Guru was fervently taking down notes. I took him for a Ghot initially, but he turned to be quite the opposite! We hardly interacted in our first year(Actually i was a Ghot back then :P). But our friendship really took off after that awesome road trip to Anjuna in 2-1.An absolutely fun person to be with.Guaranteed entertainment! His 'Guruisms' are a part of Ah4 folk-lore (Probability remember? :P). A die-hard Arsenal Fan (gets realllly upset when Arsenal loses). RVP and Arsenal posters adorn his freakishly clean room. Has an insect-phobia, gets totally freaked out on seeing them. A FIFA addict. And a gadget freak---comes with some brand new, high-end gadget every semester. Hates the CDC's but has started acing them off late. Aspires to be a manager someday, which I am sure he will. We've had some truly memorable moments in these 3 years, be it- Bogmalo, or those  numerous road trips (Did I mention his love for driving?), and am sure there are many more to come. BITS life wouldn't have been the same without you. In a few years from now, I hope to see you flaunting the  "I'm CEO Bitch" card. Long live and prosper!
Cheers!
PS- Insane times await us in 4-2!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>
