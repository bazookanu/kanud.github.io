<h1 class="page-title">Harsh Vardhan Bagaria</h1><p>Don't go on this guy's height. This guy is going to be a big man. He is a simple and practical guy. I think his nick BOSS, totally right because he is the boss in real terms. When you talk to him you don't see any kind of pretension. He is one of the finest friends I have. I wish him a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Harsh is a brilliant guy. Very friendly, very social, seems to know a million people and always has something interesting to talk about. He shows maturity way beyond his years and is the best person to go to if you want clear, practical advice. He has a fantastic approach to work and remarkable clarity of thought. He is also one of the most interesting speakers I have come across with a very natural, informal style that makes you sit up and take note. Honest, trustworthy, cheerful,  dependable - he is an excellent friend to have. It has been wonderful knowing you and I wish you a glorious future ahead.

<p>The thing about Horse is that when he speaks, you automatically begin to notice and pay attention. It isn't that what he might be saying is always relevant, but his nonchalant and smooth speech never fails to catch your notice. He will regale you with hilarious tales of his school (the most simple of which are borderline scandalous). His banter with the perennial inhabitant(s) of his room as he attempt to shove them off his own bed are outright entertaining and his reactions while playing FIFA are simply side-splitting. He is genuinely gracious and friendly, a quality which endears him to all.
Harsh is truly brilliant...Truly the BOSS.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>"Dude seriously! kya bol rahe ho boss? matlab aisa kaise ho sakta hai? dekh lo mere saath mazak mat karo. I wont stand up to argue as it's not gonna make a difference! " That's all he ever says.. He's too funny! My foreign return buddy, wish you all the best! :) Tanmaya
