<p>A great painter, F1 fan and Android lover, has remarkable knowledge in many fields, very straightforward and honest person, a great debater - his views on some topics are something worth listening to, a great friend and a true Artist.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Multi-talented is what comes to your mind when you think of Harshal (HC). The ease with which he sets about coding is matched by the fluency of his art work and the depth of his photography. His passion is always on display for everyone to see and nothing is more visible than the larger than life painting of Jimi Hendrix which HC made.
Also, he is always open to a midnight meal of maggi, chips and a can of coke for which many are grateful!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>HC is one of the first people I met on coming to this campus. He's an amazing artist, and that one geek friend everyone has who's their "Tech Guy". He creates the coolest sketches, clicks beautiful photographs and suggests great music. He can achieve anything he sets his heart on doing. Not to mention the fact that he's a loyal friend, and the only twenty-year old I know who survived without a cell phone for over a month! Stay the way you are, and hope you achieve great success! Wish you all the best, amigo!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>My neighbour, popularly called HC, was not known to me for about 2 months after joining BITS! If I remember correctly, our friendship was forged due to long AOE matches and post game discussions between ‘The Goan Group’ and his. Later we realized we had a lot more in common, like love for computers and everything technology related, hatred for Microsoft :P, both fans of pink floyd, F1, photography, etc. I will surely miss the long discussions about random stuff including cursing certain professors, exams, mess food, making fun of Pranavs QODs, ... He is the person you can go to when you need to know what to study and what not to in a subject! He is also the person who made me start watching HIMYM, House and a few other TV series. And how can I forget, he is just TOO GOOD an artist! All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Harshal! Great guy I've known since my very first sem, all thanks to kala :) I got to know him better in PS1. His art is well spell-bounding, his knowledge of his subjects is amazing but most of all his simplicity is what I admire the most. We have had both awesome and not-so-cool times together and what we share in common is that we both crib a lot (a lot is a lot :P). I know he will do well wherever he goes and I wish him all the best for his awesome future. Keep smiling & cribbing \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Harshal is one of the most passionate artists of my generation . Ask anyone who saw him make the larger-than-life Jimmy Hendricks portrait for WAVES 2011 and they will say the same . His handwriting is also print quality. There have been times when I have seen people who dont know him, gape at his writing (literally! Its that good). He is also someone who is never bogged down by lethargy. If something important has to be done, he will get it done. Whether its getting up for an 8'o'clock tut or studying for a paper throughout the night. We share common interests (mobiles, coding, games) and we have a lot of fights over them , which is what keeps us close. He is also a practical electronics guy and has done the core level electronics programming that I fancy. For this (and a lot many other things) he totally worships his genius brother. He is notorious for complaining about stuff. he can complain incessantly about any damn thing! And you suddenly start feeling that your life is so much better :P One thing is for certain though, Harshal wont hesitate to help you with notes/acads/drawing over anything from a graph paper to a pirate hat (this ones a big help) . He even made the DoPy logo for us. The first time we met was over an AOE game. And the first thing I noticed was that deeeep voice of his. A lot has happened since then and I am glad to be his friend. I am also exactly one year younger than him ( better way of saying it :P ) . Heres to all the corridor masti that we did. Best of luck!

PS - If you want to see a very adorable side of harshal, just get him drunk because that's when he showers his love over you :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>
<p>The first word that come to your mind when you meet Harshal is "Artist" and he is one in all aspects. He is a simple, caring, humble nature person who doesn't care what people say or do, he always follows his heart. His paintings and sketches are just way beyond appreciation. His love for Pink Floyd, F1, Android, Robotics and Coding is truly commendable. Out of which Android holds a special position very close to his heart. He just loves the gadget world may it be mobiles, computers, cameras etc etc. He is an aspiring photographer too. He is a very straightforward person and always speaks to the point. He is a great debater, those long lasting discussions we had with him at the snacks table were great fun and his views on some topics are something always worth listening to. He never says no for any kind of help you need and he does everything he can to help you out. Cheers to all the talks we had during snacks & NC and all the fun we had these three years, I have great memories of all these. I wish you all the luck for your future and I'll surly be in touch with you (this wont be a problem coz now you have your phone also :P )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Probably one of the pro-est guys in this campus. Mr. Technical I would call him. Not like those muggu types in CS who study 24*7 in the library to get good grades but the ones who are always ahead when it comes to lab practicals, assignments, projects..the things which require real technical know how. A great artist as well who has made many awesome drawings in his time in BITS which I guess still grace different parts of the B Dome. I would always remain thankful to you dude for the encouragement you gave me on my blogging. Keep in touch and Jai Mata di lets Rock ( No idea why I wrote this).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>A great artist, Harshal makes totally mind-boggling paintings! Love 'em! He never shies away from self-publicizing those paintings and sketches either :P
His technical knowledge surpasses that of most people in BITS. And he is always ready to help out the less adept, even if he has to go out of his way to do so. Truly, multi-talented and yet, no airs, that's Harshal for you.
He abhors most of the course-work in BITS (and rightly so). And even mentioning a particular name from the teaching staff here can get him all fired up! Have had many a heated discussion with him on that :P
i bet you'll go a long way with all your talents! All the best! Stay in touch :)

<p>An amazing photographer, talented artist and a nice human being defines HC. He is truly a multi talented person. His paintings are unforgettable (ex. Jimmy Hendricks) and his love for his camera is paramount. Just got to know him some time before when we had awesome masti at monginis, I realized one thing about him that he is very hardworking and a dedicated person with a great sense of humor. I wish HC all the best for his life. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>I wanted to write more, but to sum it all up : You're awesome HC! YOU ROCK! :D  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Maha. Board,  Zakhlela marathi pana ( maybe your marathiness shows more because of your voice, Bombay, Pradnya,scholarship blah blah competitive exams mumbaikar kids give to get a trailor of the rat race, BTS ( he got the NTS too !!!) and BITS ! ... No our camaraderie does not go that far back into time but the impact of all of these commonalities we shared without knowing each other on our way of thinking got us going as good friends ! On those initial long Mandavi train journeys he was quiet to himself ...suddenly transformed into this super talkative , filled with some much information about operating systems, his strong passion for robotics and all those of aviation and F1 trivia i was not even aware of ... i have enjoyed every bit of those discussions. His mind is probably a perfect combination of Michelangelo's creativity and artisitic stride and Steve Jobs technical expertise ! From making Bots to scripting lines of codes with mind boggling logic to bringing Jimmy Hendrix alive on canvas to drawing the sketch of an urban Aphrodite on a train ticket this guy has cast a spell on everyone ! A die hard coke fan and with an amazing appetite for sumptuous food this guy has been an awesome company for food trips in one of the most amazing places in Goa and campus eateries too ! With his impeccable knowledge , sharp coding skills and the grit to challenge convention this guy is sure to make it big in any sector of technology ! I am sure with that blend cynicism and the critic in him his work will have the great mark of perfection. Mr Chaudhari this testimonial aint any good bye or good lucky for life signature mark ... maybe a few words to commemorate yet another commonality we will soon have called  BE (Hons) from BITS ; I will have an Msc (Hons ) too :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>
<p>I 1st met Harshal in 1st year while playing aoe. Goans vs Mumbaikars aoe matches lasting for atleast 4 hours followed by long discussions on them, that was the start of our friendship which continued even after we stopped aoe. We are also in the same cooridoor in our hostel so meet n talk very often. He kind of became a psuedo goan I guess being with us :D An awesome artist, Seriously his art works are of professional quality. A big fan of music and loves to play his guitar, listen to and sketch famous guitarists like david gilmour, jimi hendrix etc. He is also a tech geek, keeps in tab with all the new technical gadgets. A really good programmer and especially likes to program microprocessor devices. Normally he takes acads lite, never attends any classes :P but during exams I'm jealous of his ability to just learn everything so fast with so much concentration and doing full night outs and then end up with good marks. He always sticks to his beliefs and can argue on them for hours to prove his point if others disagree. He'll also help you in anything, just have to ask. We have had loads of fun in all our years at bits and its sad that its just last few days left together in BITS. Best of luck and hope we keep meeting in future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
<p>The Android fanboy (or fan-buoy), Harshal is simply awesome. Not only is he an awesome coder, his passion for photography is also commendable. Apart form this, his hand writing is probably the best I've seen in a long long time. As if this wasn't enough, his skill in Art is mind-blowing. It was always a delight to see what he drew. Whether he drew on the back of a train-ticket, on a sheet of paper, canvas, his mobile or his laptop, each of his drawings were awe-inspiring. I'll always remember the time we spent discussing Android and gadgets in general. I guess he is one of the few people I've met who love Pav Bhaji as much as I do :P 
Will surely miss you. I am sure you have a great future ahead. Have fun :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
