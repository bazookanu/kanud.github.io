<h1 class="page-title">HARSHIT PATHAK</h1><p>Jhaad... Mr. Philosopher. He is a thoughtful person with a different approach towards life. He can be easily found making plans. Waise bolta zada hai, karta kam hai. He likes making arguments which he calls his "knowledge building sessions". 
He is a true friend at heart and is always keen to help others. With his sharp mind, he has a long way to go. Your principles sometimes annoy me. But always keep your principles high, they keep you grounded. I wish you find your purpose in life very soon. 
Keep rocking! \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-agha">AKSHAT AGHA</a></p>
<p>He lives not more than a city block away from my house back in Lucknow but we were destined to meet far away from there, here at Goa and become good friends. He is someone whose conscience, intellect and passion I really appreciate. He is one guy who really has a deep rooted aesthetic, philosophical side which pops up generally after he gets some low scores and stuff :P :P. A very caring and considerate friend who is always very soft-spoken and witty at the same time. Can get along with almost anyone and has this amazing ability to impress all at the first meeting by his genuine intellect and softness of verbal style. He is someone with whom one can confide almost everything and trust him to keep mum. Has very ideals and strives to keep them intact at all situations. Takes to his interests and work religiously and will never give up until the last moment. I learnt quite a few things from him, most importantly that of "believing in oneself" something which he is an epitome of. I will always cherish the time I spent with him and all that he had to teach me. Wish him all the best for the future and hope we remain friends forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>

<p>Jhad ! I feel proud to be the name giver for this guy. It's completely nonsensical about how he got this name. I say Auguste Rodin must have used Jhad as his subject in The Thinker. :D He is Mr. Philosopher ! I am amazed how one can stay so thoughtful all the time. I can't even imagine being so. His kindness and care for others is a level apart, the one we only get to read about. He's one of my companions in the numerous journeys from Goa-Mumbai and back. Ah ! How I'd miss those priceless journeys. We've had lots, I repeat LOTS of fun together. Be it the time Murder 2 was put up in the bus and how we mocked the old guy sitting next to us or how I mock him with the UP scene (no offense meant :P). Or how he mocks me with Pink Floyd and LOTR (Gundaalf :D). He's one hell of a friend to be with. My efforts towards learning to be down to earth and compassionate towards others from Jhad continue till date. Be it acads or be it pranks, he aces them all; especially pranks :D Remember the one friend in need we've read about in books ? Yes, he's the one. I remember when I returned to hostel with my other two friends from Mumbai in not a decent condition (*wink*) and he happily let me sleep in his room and himself stayed up all night. Man, THAT is something. I'm so so happy to have him as one of the jewels in my crown of friends. The one good thing I like about you is the you never wanna seek attention or gain footage and just be what you are. Hats off to you ! All the very best in life. I don't hope, I know we shall be friends forever :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>he was my neighbor till the first year, then he shifted to the floor above, believe it or not, he really made us feel his void. he was the best neighbor one could have asked for. too lazy but really charming. 
us shaitaani khopdi mein hamesha tafreen soojhti rehti hai :D 
i still remember waking him up before the morning class and finding him in his bed after i returned to my room. 
he also taught me how to bolt the door from inside while you are standing out using a thread! (dunno if he remembers that.)

hes a man with a gigantic heart, cares for his friends in the truest sense. extremely amiable, trustworthy and patient, you would never see him angry or pissed off with anyone.
Always eager to learn (guns, automobiles esp! ) 
this is something surprising about him but yes, he's a spiritual and a God fearing man. :)
he can be anyone's best friend, very easily! 
All the luck for your future, and remain in touch. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>Harshit aka jhaad –Spider-man of our group!!  He is a unusal mix of ‘prankster’ and ‘man of principles’.  He loves to take out time to look back at his actions in past, trying to find “THE AIM OF HIS LIFE”!!.... I myself have participated in some these sessions with him. But the time when he was not ‘thinking’ he was one of the best friends one could ever had. Definitely one of the best hearts I have ever known.  Just follow your heart and I am sure you will definitely rock it in life!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-bharadwaj">Aditya Bharadwaj</a></p>
<p>Jhad - If want to know the origin of this nick name for him......just look at his hair :P. I still remember, he was so thin, shy guy in 1st year. Always used to sit chup chap n all....sab masti karte uski toh bhi chup chap betha rehta......n anyone who will look at his face will say he is such a nice guy. But after a year, he showed his true colours......n whtever i said above turned out to be the opposite. All that runs in his mind is how to harass others. Still remember the prank he played with someone.....that guy went to washroom n in tht time using a thread he closed his room from inside n no one being inside the room!!  He has a Devil's mind.

All his philosophical thoughts are of EPIC level. Thode thode dino mai iske andar alag alag logo ki aatma ati hai.....aaj kisi scientist ki ayi toh thode dino tak padhta hi rahega.....fir pandit ki ayi toh thode dino tak puja path......bas aisi chalta rehta hai......:D

All those pranks played with you were awesome.....n will miss those days forever.......n will miss u too bro!!
