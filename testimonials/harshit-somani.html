<h1 class="page-title">Harshit Somani</h1><p>somanyyyy... great things come in small packets! he is one such small packet! simple and charming (cute would be more apt! :D ). i had the privilege to travel with him to Delhi from colg, spent quite a few memorable hours there :P
trips to palolem, vasco etc with him and his light attitude (which did annoy sometimes) will be cherished. 
P.S.: Friends \m/

<p>Harshit Somani is genuinly helpful and understanding person, he is very resourceful and has a solution to everything. He is well composed. Its fun to hangout with him. He is an avid reader of books and sitcoms freak. He is a diehard for Friends (tv series). He is so  lazy that he can skip the whole day meals due to his laziness. It has been fun to be his neighbor. I wont forget the time spent in group studies, waking me up for exams and classes, late night futsal matches and the time spent together doing time pass. Able to manage his activities with elegance, success is soon to follow him. All the best for your future!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>Harshit ! A guy who is extemely calm and has an enormous potential. Decency is imbibed in him naturally and he is so much fun to be with !! He would be always ready to help without an itch !! A guy who prefers skipping his meals because he thinks the mess is too far. (lol..although I don't approve of that :P ) !! The one because of whom I will have to watch the whole series of Friends !! And yes I have not seen it !! :P ;) Great going harshit !! You are complete in every sense. A decisive guy who has all relevant stuff to say ! :D :) I wish you all the very best harshit for a bright future ahead and I know you are definitely going to scale the heights because of your get going attitude !! :D :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>
<p>Harshit bhai....kya bolun tere bare mein!!!! You are a totally awesome guy to hang around with and a true friend. You are a really sweet person who enjoys his life. Studying during fests is one of your specialty (i mean kaise yaar!!!!). You have one of the best rooms in our hostel and you keep pulling my leg in that regard. A die hard 'Friends' fan and an ardent Dia Mirza fan, your laptop is full of 'Friends' wallpapers and your room is full of Dia Mirza posters. You always know how to take laaaiiiteee....:D. Harshit, I'll really miss you my friend, especially your constant requests to take you to the mess daily (even though I still believe the other way to my room is shorter :P) Wish you all the best for your future and may you live a very happy life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Hum dost ke dost hain :) From the few but fun meetings I have had with this cool guy I have observed that his calm and friendly nature makes him approachable and fun to hangout with. I will always remember that PICTIONARY during Zephyr '11, epic as it was and so was the SUIT trip to Panjim. I wish him all the best for his future, may it be as awesome as him and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>

<p>I came to know harshit for the first time during our microbiolab. Actually got to interact with him during 3-1. He has amazing computer skills. He is very humble and down to earth person. As far as I've observed he is a computer geek and never shows off which is a great quality to learn from him. He is a great friend (from the conversations his friends have with him)  and a fun person to talk to..  . Very dedicated ,dependable person. Best of luck for a great future ahead :) Simplicity is a great virtue and you have it Harshit :)  We'll stay in touch for sure :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Harshit! The first person I met on campus. Turns out both of our parents are Batch-mates. Thats something common. Then, turns out we had our rooms very close to each other and since that day Harshit has been a steady rock for me, someone I can rely with my whole heart. He has helped out on many tight situations. It is his calm demeanor which brings a zen-like feeling in me. We have shared many epic trips to different places :) The unique feature I noticed id his love for Dia Mirza. All wallpapers are of her only! Im sure his DREAM would be Dia Mirza stripping for him and then proposing to him :D :P :) Slightly short in stature, he reminds me of the good ole hobbits, always happy and smiling, not a care or frown on their face and every helpful. Harshit dude, never change. You are \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Harshit... a very calm and nice person who is known for his 'laaaiii8' attitude (which he probably acquired from his li8 branch :P) He is a very sweet and genuine guy.  We had many awesome moments together... palolem trip, forcing tyagi to play chammak challo, his efforts at carrom (costed me every game) and zephyr photography event. I'll miss those times which could not have been so great without you. Have a nice life ahead (be it with or without Dia Mirza :D)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>

<p>Harshit is the the Mr. Dependable, Friends & 2.5 men fan, and a resourceful guy.
Tall in his calm nature, tall in his perplexed & unparalleled Studying, tall in his helpful nature. Man, you are the ideal personification of innate human-ness.
His love for Dia Mirza made me realize that he was the first member of the Dia Mirza fan club in this whole Freaking World! :P

It has been an absolute privilege to have known you. May you reach high heights in your life, fulfill all your ambitions & marry Dia Mirza one day!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Harshitaaaaaa!!!!! One of few people who makes me feel tall everytime I see him! :D In a parallel universe, he's married to Dia Mirza. (Or is it Diya?) Unfortunately, in this one, he's married to his books and his phone. EVERY SINGLE TIME that I've been to his room, he's studying something or the other. And I'm yet to see someone over-utilize his phone as much as he has. Studious, friendly, truly lazy and always calm - I've hardly seen him lose his temper or shout at anyone in the last three years! And having a personality like that, he's done a commendable job living right opposite Puneet! It's been great having you around all this while and I hope it stays that way for times to come! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>

<p>My best friend and at the same time my biggest enemy. We have been through almost everything be it good, bad, evil or great we have shared a lot. I can't write a testimonial for you because testimonials are written when people are bidding farewell to each other I can't even imagine a situation where we won't be together anymore. From his peculiar taste of music to his laziness and from his inspirations to his charisma each and every trait is adorable. His love for Dia Mirza is worth mentioning and I seriously pity his wife to be because he'll convince her to change her name to Dia or he'll find a girl named Dia :D . Every moment we shared was special be it the countless trips or the labs or the discussions (u know what i mean) or the combined studies or the debates or the fights or the times I kept irritating you. Your the most laziest person I have seen on this campus i'm sorry but you are, and the way you used your phone even the manufacturer's wouldn't have realized that it could be used in so many different ways. His attitude and nature earned him lot of respect and friends and you'll struggle to find reasons not to like this guy. His charm is unique. With him you'll hardly notice time fly by. I respect your ambitions and the way you look at life at each step and also the care you take to make in making each and every decision however insignificant it may be. Just be the way you are and I'm sure you'll fulfill all your dreams and ambitions because you deserve them. My cheetu, my kutta, my kamina, my stone cold beeyatch I'll miss you. All the best!! Cheers!! :) PS : sirf facial hair hone koi zyada mard nahi banta :D XOXOXO :* :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
