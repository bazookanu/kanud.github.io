<h1 class="page-title">Harshvardhan</h1><p>My first friend in campus.... well i l forever be thankful to him for introducing me to some of my closest friends...Shashi, Chintu, Prathamesh, Raghav, Pandit, nd Pranav.
Harsh is more of a brother ...He would scold me for bunking classes, lecture me on grades and most importantly always ready to loan any amount i want :)
As far as his professional life is concerned, I can describe him in two words -  hardworking and dedicated, quite important qualities which most of us lack here  :P 
Thanks Harsh for being there for me. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nawaz-nasar">Nawaz Nasar</a></p>
<p>Harsh, you're undisputed best blogger of BITS. I loved reading your blogs in my first year and i'm amazed how could you still hold that freshness.. After Tuhin i guess you're the only person to master both English and Hindi... Your blogs about love and relationships are a great hit.. Apart from mastering the art of writing you're also master the art of making a conversation interesting. It's always been fun to engage you in a conversation. Thanks for making every moment spent with you special.. Will miss you a lot.. Have a great life ahead and keep posting blogs.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Harsh is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. He's very friendly, very humble and always makes you feel welcome. He's very creative too. His work for MATRIX has made him a legend for the juniors who'll join in the coming years and his blog is one of the most enduring memories that I'll carry away from BITS. The most popular blog in campus by quite some distance - it's simply brilliant. He has a very rational approach to life and offers excellent advice even in the trickiest of situations. It has been a pleasure knowing you, Harsh. I'm certain that you going achieve great success. But more importantly, wherever you go, you'll make it a much happier place. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>

<p>Love is all that matters..his motto for life I'll put it as. Never judges things rationally but for his love towards them.  Remains stupid in love (by choice) . And you love him for his love, and trust him for his love. Hard to replace piece of a puzzle..  i'll make sure i will not misplace it. Living to love is hard and he admits it, never mind it will be  comfortable when you find your feet. .my shoulders in your pocket ...speed dial no.2.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-nalawade">Pranav Nalawade</a></p>
