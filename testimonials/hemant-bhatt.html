<h1 class="page-title">Hemant Bhatt</h1><p>A jovial, jolly fellow who really talks sense. His charisma is overwhelming as it evident by the entourage of girls surrounding him always. Do not be fooled by his diminutive physical appearance for he does pack a verbal punch should you begin to argue with him. It is always a pleasure talking to him for he really does understand other people really well and is considerate towards everyone. His "walk-while-you-talk-all-over-the-hostel", "hair-spikes" and "permanent-earphones-glued -to-ears" styles are well recognised now. Intelligent and hard-working(evident from him taking 3 elecs this sem), he is a good student (attends all classes).  He is always fun to have around as a friend. All the very best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Hemant-The Business Mind.. He is a person who can gel in with any kind of group very easily. We have been lab partners in almost all mech labs, and this one of the reasons of them being worth remembering for me. He, with his jokes, riddles will make you smile always. It has been a great experience knowing him, and being tagged as 'Karti Devi'. :) Wish you all luck and happiness in life :)

<p>My buddy from "THE CHD". Hemant is  One of the better futsal strikers on campus, it has always been a pleasure playing alongside him. He is a gifted orator and possesses brilliant writing skills as well. His is  one of the first doors I knock when I leave for my mid-night food-hunt and this guy never disappoints(plays hard-to-get in the beginning though). Also,  I have disturbed him innumerable times just to have a sip of water :P. and that has led to many, long pointless conversations He has been one of my closest friends on campus and I hope this is just the beginning. An avid gamer, and someone who has briiliant amount of business acumen , I am sure he'll make it really big in the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Hemant! There's a distinctive style to him, with his habit of roaming the entire hostel while on the phone, wearing earphones all the time, and spending more time just outside his room, than inside.This guy has always has a smile on his face. Whenever I got bored, I'd just randomly go n talk random stuff with him. I guess that's the perfect way to sum it up. Random. It's always been fun with you man. With a sharp wit and a good sense of humor, you'll go a long way in life. Keep in touch always.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Hemant aka Hemu (there are a lot of other names but lets go with this one) is one of my closest friend in BITS. He is very decent and true friend. He a person who understand others feelings quite easily and always ready to help and  can give you the best advice when you really need them . He  is a die-hard cheese lover because of which I had to eat many farm house cheese burst pizza. Apart from cheese he likes computer games very much and spend most of his leisure time playing games like CS,assassin's creed etc . He has a great writing skills and often helped me a lot with his great  vocabulary. 
We both have done a lot of thing together in BITS like going to dominoes , beaches , playing futsal ,CS,  football in corridor, cricket with badminton, TT , kick-volleyball and well exams too. Lot of the above testimonials talk about his business skill well not one knows better than me because  I was the one with which he actually had a small venture  whose net profit was only "100 rupees" but it was a really good experience that we both will never forget.  
He is one of the greatest friends one could ever ask for and  someone who'll be there for you, cheer you up, and inspire you.  Hemu ,I wish you all the best of luck in your future endeavours and this is not a goodbye, only “hasta luego” or “see you later”.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tushar-mandar">Tushar Mandar</a></p>
<p>Looks can be deceptive. This holds true for hemant , when you first see him you might write him off but wait until you get to know him!!! Don't go on his height, he will bring you down with his wit. Hemant has some great skills, he is brilliant on the mike, you might have heard him a lot of times in the audi. He is also great when it comes to managing stuff, saw that during waves when he was conducting the informals( good work!!) He is very dedicated any commitment that he takes up. A great futsal player, though i hardly see him in the common room for any football matches his love for the sport is a well known fact( he scored the winning goal in the slam final /\). All of you might have read about his others interests above so i won't go into that. All in all he's a good friend, pretty reliable, witty and fun to hang around with. It's been a pleasure knowing you . all the best for the future :)

<p>Hemant...By some weird coincidence you've been in every single lab of mine that I've hated  and dreaded till now.You made them a little more tolerable for me :)...I owe you one for that.It's been fun talking to you about completely random stuff sitting idle after EG labs or while having meals .I can never figure out how you managed to know every girl in campus :P.
All the best for your future..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/meghna-mehta">Meghna Mehta</a></p>
<p>Hemant bhatt is an incredible person I have met in my BITS life. "He showed up here as a tiny infant capable of infinite number of possibilities". He is very helpful, talented and a genuine guy. I enjoyed every single moment I spent with you, be it our corridor walks in which we used to latch the ppl from outside,  night-canteens, treats, combined studies & our plans to do ch**aap. He is nice to hangout with. He is intelligent, hardworking and focussed. He is a pro gamer (CS, assassin's creed, COD etc). He is a pro futsal player too. Able to manage his activities with elegance, success is soon to follow him. wish him all the best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
