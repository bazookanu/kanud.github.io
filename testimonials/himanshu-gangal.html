<h1 class="page-title">Himanshu Gangal</h1><p>My neighbor! In spite of that, our preferred mode of communication is Gtalk, and at very odd hours too (Himanshu never seems to sleep). He is one of those guys who can talk to anybody, about anything. His TT skills are out of this world and it looks like he’s on his way to becoming a Frisbee champ. Also, thanks for motivating me through one month of gymming at 5.30 AM!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>He may be God for the rest of the campus. For me he will always remain Gangal, the guy from Ajmer who doesn't find Jaipur girls pretty enough. He is one of the sweetest guys you will ever come across. He can easily make friends and sustain the friendship for a long time(which is a harder thing to do) He is very kind and helping in nature. He is a fun loving li8 guy who does not give a damn about the future. He knows one thing and that is to be cool in the present (baki baad me dekh lenge) There is a reason why he is called God(well there has to be) In the first year he came to the limelight by playing some world class TT. That's how people started to know him. Well to call a guy as God once or twice is one thing but to sustain it for 3 years is remarkable. And that is what Himanshu Gangal has achieved. He is extremely humble in his manners and a great friend. You will definitely love his company and always want to hang out with him. He is a great sportsperson who can play all kind of sports comfortably. tt, cricket, football, badminton, basketball and now ultimate Frisbee(no sarcasm intended). He is a dear friend with whom you can share your secrets with(but you should let him know that it is a secret) A decent guitar player. One may feel that he doesn't care much for his acads which is not entirely true. I believe he is one of those guys who are blessed with great minds but don't perform well just cause they don't want to. I think he hasn't fully utilized his potential and he could do more with his life( not that what he has achieved right now is any less) He is the kind of guy who you will remember for a long time. I have had some awesome times with him which I will never forget. He is a great friend and I am surely going to miss him. All the best for your life ahead bro.

<p>The God as he is generally known in the campus. A pro TT player who also is good in Badminton, Football, Dance, Guitar and what not. A true multi talented guy. A all rounder of the highest degree. Though he has been a proud member of the Chu Club I dare say he is the last guy one would call a Chu. A smile on his face and stupid status messages on gtalk will be the things I will remember him for. Nice knowing you man and hope you keep in touch <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>In the first 2 yrs, I knew him only as GOD but all thanks to Ultimate, I came to know of Himanshu Gangal ! In a nutshell, he is an ideal friend ! Always calm and polite ! I so admire his humbleness ! In the play, if there are more players, he would be the first person to step out and let the sub in, a true sportsman in all aspects. And your forehand needs a special mention man.  _/\_ ! One thing i can never understand is that how can a person be always hungry ! Nothing seems to satisfy his hunger. One of his three gtalk ping says "m hungry  man" ! And about gtalk, We have had some of the best conversations over gtalk :D ! (( god, plz make sure the saved chat is never out coz our pride is at stake :P !)) Anybody would enjoy his company and his witty humors. I m so mad at time for it is limited ! He is a kinda guy who's absence can be felt !! Gonna miss mongi ,central lawns, lib lawns and above all the gtalk chat! (( god, u better start making plans for the cafe of yours coz its definitely happening )) No doubt he has a rocking future ahead . cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anantaram-varatharajan">Anantaram Varatharajan</a></p>
<p>Himanshu - Words aren't enough to describe this guy. Sheer, pure Respect.. It is very difficult to find people as good as you. I am so glad that i made an acquaintance with you in my life and since then there has been no turning back. We hit it off pretty well with Table Tennis being the first adhesive of this great found friendship. Himanshu (or God as i and many others call him) is easily the best table tennis player i have ever come across. I remember those nights in the common room pretty well.. I block u hit.. U hit i block.. and this went on for hours.. Sweet memories.. 
Both of us have shared so many hungry nights together. Each night gtalk pe ping "Mudit, kuch khane ko hai".. and then i would be in denial.. then the sad face :'( and then the long wait for 7.30am!! :D 
And then comes the Guitaring.. Those amazing jamming sessions with Shady in his room. The Tears in Heaven, Laylas, Aadats and Lukka Chhupis and innumerable others. Is there anything You can't do!! You learnt guitar so fast.. one day i'm teaching u how to hit the G-String <nasty> nd with the blink of an eye ur jamming with me and shady and we are nothing but glad to have u swinging with us just lost in Music!
And then comes Ultimate Frisbee.. Something that i think both of us can agree that we can die for.. I now realize that there is so much in common between us yaar, God!! And it just makes me happy!! Tu dekhna.. Ek time aisa aayega jab hamari national level ki frisbee team hogi and usme koi ho na ho, tu, Jassi, Ram aur shayad main hoenge hi hoenge!!
These three years have been nothing but sheer bliss in your company Himanshu nd we have 1 more sem to Rock the hell out of this amazing journey.. The Random knocking on the doors, to the frisbee at lib lawns, to the late night walks to mongi, to the precision target frisbee practice, to the short movie which we planned to make but it never really turned out for good!! I could just go on and on reminiscing about all our small and sweet moments but i guess i'll run out of space!! its been one hell of an experience man and u have been to say the least - The Best and Perfect friend.. I seriously love you beyond limits, bro!! 5 of us - U, Me, Jassi, Ram and Shady - Its a Bromance afterall.. All the very best in life.. And this is not the end.. It is just the beginning to a lifelong friendship!! U'll make it very big in life nd i'm sure all of us will be there to witness it.. Love nd Peace!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mudit-sinha">Mudit Sinha</a></p>
<p>He is God. Everyone knows that. His amazing table tennis skills leave every spectator in awe. Give him any bat and any footwear, he will still whoop your ass with unmatched finesse. Will also remember him asking about  good films he can watch in the dead of the night through g-talk...Looks like after TT, its frisbee that he is about to conquer. All the best God. May you bless yourself...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>One of the nicest persons you can ever come across. His talents are known to everyone..He is good at a number of sports plays guitar and his politeness knows no bounds..With this guy there is never a dull moment around and always keeps the air cheerful. I have never seen him depressed and handles everything coolly(this is for the way you took over and made happen Shuffles when nothing was going the right). It was always fun to play TT with you as well as conducting all the TT events in the campus..Your presence made the TT hall cheerful!
Whatever be it may tu hamesha maje mein rahega...I ll always look upto that quality of yours...GOD_/\_<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>
<p>Universally accepted GOD and deservedly so. Hardly a sport or game he isn't good at, even if he is playing it for the first time. Its like he has been hard wired to excel at everything. Proud to have been in the same century as the man himself. Very soft spoken and humble person. A great personality whom I have always admired. Truly inspirational and an awesome friend. You should try hosting your own sports festival, call it Gangalympics if you can. Best of luck man, for everything!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>Gangal! I still can't get over the fact that you heard me singing man, My apologies for the pain i have caused! :P Gangal or GOD as he is fondly called, is one of the nicest people i know. My go to guy whenever i needed a wake up call in the morning since he's mostly up the entire night! He's one of the best TT players i've ever played against and i still remember all the times i tried( I think i won once!) beating him at it in the 1st year! Great memories! I still remember that SLAM game that you'll played against AH7, you were absolutely brilliant! I remember telling abin this guy could make a brilliant CB! He's also picked up the guitar to add to his many talents! Gangal is truly one of the nicest and most talented people here and i wish you huge success in life!

<p>Jungle, or all sorts of gaaliyaan jo aap de sakte ho, I address him by those :D I knew him before we got into Msc Mathematics together. I knew him as the GOD of Table Tennis. Later on as I got to know him better, I had several new revelations. He just simply excels at any, I repeat, any sport ! Baddy, TT, Frisbee, Cricket and the list goes on. I've shared uncountable (being a Maths student I should say countably infinite :P) number of songs with him. He worships Clapton. Like me, even he started learning guitar on his own in the recent years. Have jammed with him sometimes :) I still remember during POM when I was bugged of the mugging and this guy would ping me every half an hour, "Kitna hua ?" "Nahi padhna yaar" "Ghar jaana hai bc" :D Such an awesome year we've had in Msc. Mathematics ! TK and Anil doodhwala have been the target of most of our jokes :P One thing about him that I respect is that he wants to do everything in life and never stops learning anything new. Hats off to you yaar. Will miss you a lot. Especially times like Filing during workshop :P Keep up the same never give up attitude and have a wonderful life ahead. We will stay in touch !! :) Cheers ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Himanshu, the understated mathematics maestro and the overstated sports genius. This guy has it all. He is the perfect blend of coolness and pro-ness packed into human form. Add to it his artistic endeavors(guitarist, table drummer) and you begin to understand why he is known as god by quite a few. It will not be long before we have a religion named after him by his followers. 
Cheers to all the grinding, dumb jokes, taking peoples case and the most random discussions in class, without which i wouldn't have survived maths, workshop & life till now.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/debanjum-singh-solanky">Debanjum Singh Solanky</a></p>
<p>Oye Der ? :P . Himanshu Gangal ,  the patron saint of Gtalk . If the guy is not online , no need to check on DC , ur net is indeed gg . Doesn’t speak much (not a gud quality :x). Even on Gtalk , the most I can get out of him is the annoying “hmm hmm” routine or occasionally , one-two “Han be” . The day I first met this guy , had to walk 2-3 hrs in scorching heat on the highway. And the irony, all the way I was talking about playing TT with him >.<. Needless to say , the guy toasted me in TT the very same evening . A real modest person , I remember in first year calling him god on mainchat with different nicks, and he wud immediately ping me asking my name and pleading not to call him dat on mc. That modesty is still der and I hope it always remains dat way (although wont play tt or baddy wid me as I m too ‘noob’ for him :x ).Really got to know him in second year and he has been a very dear friend ever since . Seriously man , Gtalk , the best invention ever. I can just open his gtalk window anytime and vent out anything I want. And we have had some really great conversations on Gtalk (Hope u r saving them). And also, a mention for the mails in PS1. That was one awesome period . And talking about conversations , the discussions we have had about music ....the blues vs folk , the Clapton vs Dylan , the music vs lyrics.... really enjoyed all of them. And ya, he will always ask for song recos and will never listen to any of dem :x . And yes , have to mention ur guitar skills here, u have really progressed in that regard in a very short time. A true sportsperson , want s to play every single sports in the world . Does not care too much for competition, plays for fun , which I don’t quite get , but still respect his attitude. Don’t know when the guy sleeps , always pinging u shit all day. Have had too many great experiences with him ....the whole movie making experience , the numerous attempts at song making , all the future planning , all the flak I had to take for my attempts wid harp , all the gtalk chudaap(the numerous “tu das saal ke baad apne aap ko kahan dekhta hai” :D )and ya all the cold wars in between .... it was a life changing journey with you...and I m glad I took it. Hope u get the guts to get everything u want in life.
P.S. The herb . You’ve promised now.

<p>Gangal....prooo(est) person .....kya nahi karta ye.....TT guitar frisbee and somethings which he started in PS...."jahan roj bhagwaan shiv k bhakt baith k mandali lagaate the " . I remember that trip to puri....when u threw away ur one slipper and that horrifying walk .....and u walking down the road with only one slipper on. U were the one who used to entertain us by ur live concerts at the roof. It would have been very difficult to pass those 54 days without frnds like u. I wish we can relive that time ....karein kya reunion angul mein....hehehehe. U will always b a special frnd .....best of luck for the future...and stay in contact :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anchit-saini">Anchit Saini</a></p>
