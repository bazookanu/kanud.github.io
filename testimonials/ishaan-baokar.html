<p>So Ishaan ..The 'Punekar'!! One of my best friends in Bits.. He is basically a cartoon, funny and unique in his own way..He is very Brilliant, hard working, supportive, very lively and yes! Courageous !!.. I have never seen any guy as sincere as Ishaan.. He is basically a very good planner. He loves chatting and can talk continuously for hours..Some of his philosophies are very interesting. He loves to tease all the people around him..he has nice humor.. The one thing I hate about him is when he tries to explain family tree which is his own creation :):P   So in all, very jolly and understanding and super-li8 !!Best of luck for your future endeavours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tanvi-parekar">Tanvi Parekar</a></p>
<p>Chocolate boi...aka referee...aka pandaa...its an endless list!! Probably one of the most 'talked abt gys' esp. in ME! This is the only person in the entire campus who is literally amazed by the hovering fighter jets each morning...mind you.. he can even tell u the engine make of the fighter jet just by hearing it...very passionate about anythng that relates to these jets! I could stiil not figure out the reason behind his indulge into 'forced bhaichaara'..belive me, not many are left in the campus who are yet to fall prey to his family tree! If not found in his room....CH5-roadside is the place where he is! Most sincere when it comes to studies...helpful...u wont get bored talking to this guy!! always@gtalk...and one thing i must say...he's one of the best friends i'v found in this campus :) Dude...u have a great career ahead...just keep the good work going...wish u Luck...cheers :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sahu">Siddharth Sahu</a></p>

<p>Ishaan Baokar, panda aka biotech sweetheart aka someone’s OUR ISHAAN aka encyclopaedia of IAF and MOSAD :) CH5 bench is his second home and as per rumours he is the owner of Borkar’s franchise in campus and also he likes to identify him as a Ted Mosby of our group which he is not. He likes to get high with breezer only (hahaha) and always ready for fun.  ;) LOL.....keeping jokes apart. First of all, he is very funny and “studious” guy. :) He is also quick witted and the king of comedy in our group. He is also a hard core "metal" fan and only partner in head banging in concerts....high five.... \m/ (will miss it after college) ;) He is very sincere and hardworking when it comes to studies, projects and seminar. He is my one of the best friends in BITS-G. I am sure he will be a very successful person in life. Dude, wish you very happy life ahead.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhruv-vyas">Dhruv Vyas</a></p>
