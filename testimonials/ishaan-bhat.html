<h1 class="page-title">Ishaan Bhat</h1><p>Easily recognizable from a distance due to the bulky structure :P and trademark shorts :D .
Always willing to help and just like me one of those few physics peoples who loves the second degree more.A _/\_ coder and the biggest fan of TV series , he has watched almost all of those that I know :| .1 great yr gone by and still another one of EEE to go by.All the best.
We also met at Gentings right???? :D.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-satish-kulkarni">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Fungii is cool. With a good sense of humour, a strong technical inclination, and a passion to work, he can tackle everything. You can always trust him to help you out when in a sticky spot. Though we never got a chance to know each other better, the neural classes we shared were great fun. He's truly interested in research, and can spend hours perfecting an algorithm. Here's to a bright future to you. Best of Luck.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>

<p>Here I am writing my first testimonial and seems only right that I start with you.....
It was just another rainy morning in Mumbai, and Ishaan walked into the school wearing a fungus laden raincoat. And that's how Ishaan became 'Fungii'. I have never called you by your first name ever since. Fungii is one of the most talented people on campus, Physics and EEE being his forte. He is very passionate about Electronics and has done an amazing job as Electronics Club Sub Co-ordi this year.The speed with which he grasps concepts simply amazes me! That apart, Fungii has a good sense of humour and knows perfectly well how to chill (a regular at boga and velino :D). He is a voracious reader, and can speak about everything ranging from classic literature to economics. There are many epic moments we've had-- you passing out in Bede's washroom with a washing machine on yourself being one of the most notable ones! And I am sure there are many more to come :)
It was great to have your company and am sure you'll go places in life.
Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>
<p>Fungiii!! This guy has got impeccable taste be it books, music, movies, tv shows etc. He not only phodufies Acads but manages to find time to do random bullshit which includes exploring new cultural stuff to playing LAN games. This guy has introduced me to a lot of awesome stuff and having debates with him have always been intellectually stimulating. Probably best known for his sense of humour, this guy has the loudest laugh. I remember watching Delhi Belly with him and he was laughing so loudly that everyone around us in the  theatre started staring us :P This guys regular visits to my place during PS made my stay bearable in Chennai. A true mumbaikar with "chalta hain" attitude (trademark kachchas in classrooms) and mumbai style of diction, this guy is an amazing guy to hangout with. Now that we are neighbours next year in CH1, cheers to that! The next year will truly be EPIC!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Fungii, has been one of my first friends on campus. He is a very smart , hardworking and intelligent guy. An avid reader , he also enjoys music , TV shows and movies. He loves to sleep in "comfort". I will always remeber the random walks in Vasco, bogmalo trips and many other outings which we've had togerther. A great guy to have in the corridor, we've had an awesome time on the second floor. A shrewd guy , who knows whom to go to when broke, Fungii claims he's merely practicing for facing banks in the future. (:P) He is the guy to have got lucky at a beach last year. Electronics is second nature to him and in sure his dream of researching something great in this field will not go in vain. Hope you have a great life ahead and earn loads of cash!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
<p>Fungii...the name itself has it.."fun"..:D.I got to know about this guy around the middle of 2-2 when we did an "EPIC" project ( credits to Shobith..:D). He is damn intelligent but lazy to the core. With zero attendance and 1 day preparation he can rape any exam.. His laugh is one of a find. It is sometimes more funnier than the joke. You can hear it even if you are 5 rooms away.He believes in enjoying life to the fullest...( you know what i mean). He is a goooood friend and the best Lab-partner. We share the same views of manipulating techniques..:D. He made physics CDCs easier for me.. I m glad that I hav one more year to spend with this awesome guy.  All the best for the future and wish you all the luck for achieving great heights..(ob he will)...:D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>Fungii.. its hard to find him by any other name. Vey hard. When I saw his name on my wall saying Ishan Bhat, took me atleast 2 mins to realize he is the same person.
Likes linux, and I remember going over to his house back in mumbai and doing some linuxgiri over there. Other than this, a common thing we share, is something which wouldnt really make sense to a third person. It goes by an emoticon \_________/ and an acronym BBDs, but thats about all I can say.
Frequents Velinos, and preeti more often than B dome, which in itself is a class. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhaavan-merchant">Bhaavan Merchant</a></p>
<p>Bhat Ishaan Rajesh...whatever i write about this human being is not enuf....He is simply the coolest person in the world. The first time i saw him, I badly wanted to comb his hair :D . He always wears shorts, even for exams !!! Circulation of air increases efficiency was his reason :P . fungii as we call him affectionately, is the most helpful guy. He clears doubts better than the teachers . His grasping power is so evolved that just a look at the textbook and he can derive entire laws :O . We study together for physics tests ,assignments and exams. I don't think I could have studied those dry subjects without the company of such a cheerful person . We always laugh at least once per sentence when we speak  . His sense of humor matches mine and hence we connect very well through jokes. We both love 9gag and for once we wanna upturn a table :D . His taste of music is so awesome man !! He made me realize that whatever i was listening till 2nd year was absolute bullshit. Fungii is a typical "mumbaicha porga" .Life mein khao piyo aur aish karo( last day studies ) He is always suggesting me new places to eat in Goa and believe me they are amazing. Even though he started gaming just recently, he has already become a pro in aoe .He even broke some records in games on my mobile phone. Even though we get notes from goddess ranjita, fungii is the saint who preaches them XD. We had lots of fun during IMA lab. The best thing about fungii is his frank nature. His clear mindedness and ability to analyze any situation and come out with a solution is worth a special mention. Even though he is not religious, he likes bhajan(if u know what i mean). I hope(and i know it) next year (with all the EEE cdcs) will be even more imba \m/ . M sure this lucy's sky diamond will shine brightly in future (>.< srry beatles)... keep laughing and keep hoohaaing :-*

<p>Five o five o! I only got to know you this sem, thanks to our epic AoE marathons, and I was amazed at how much we had in common when it comes to our tastes in movies, books and tv shows. Fellow Wire and AD fanatic, this guy's stories are truly epic, and still make me laugh when I recollect them. Here's to an awesome sem. See ya next year!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Fungii!!!! When I first heard this nickname of his, I wondered why would someone be called Fungii when it has no relation to either his name or his surname!!!! It was only later that I realized the actual reason for it....Fungii is a guy who will always be remembered by me for his never-ending list of stories....especially the ones you told while on the dining table :P. I have always admired his ability to do things when they are supposed to be done....he totally enjoys most of his college days, and when the tests get near, he is seen studying and phodofying them. His understanding of concepts is marvelous. He is one guy who goes in shorts everywhere, even to the tests. He is a really cool guy with a good sense of humor. I am sure you will rock the EEE  CDCs. All the best for your future life. We will stay in touch always :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>FANJI... First of all I must tell you this that i spent half an hour searching for your account but then I realized the name is ishaan, not fanji..Was trying fan , fanj, FANJIM and so many other  combination but  couldn’t find you.. Finally...I don’t know where to start from.. This last year was so much fun and it wouldn’t have been so without you.. Had an awesome company and let me tell you that sometimes I wish should I have studied more and taken EEE in dual I could spend another awesome year with you.  If I were to describe funji I would say he is one of the most amazing  and charismatic personality  I have seen in our batch.. Always exited to do something new and a good friend, he’ll never say no to anybody.  Will always remember our zuari trips and all the time we spend together. I know that you will achieve a lot in life, so don’t forget to donate half of your income to ISABCON..!!
Be the same.. Always!!

<p>Fungii! My friend with the coolest nickname and the coolest source of the same. Fellow AB devotee, Pappu fan, Grateful Dead & Doors fan (L.A. Woman FTW), Velino buddy and Rahul Gandhi duper.  Fungii, generally dressed in his trademark shorts – worn to classes and exams alike – heavily downplays his brilliance and academic prowess. One of the few people who are good at academics and actually have knowledge. He’s an avid reader, has an eclectic taste in music & TV shows and has the most epic BBQ nation stories. I cannot thank him enough for introducing me to zenpencils and accommodating me in the periodic AH4 binges. Cheers Fung! Bombay party on the 15th !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Fungii!! He's this smart, intelligent, chilled out guy with this pure diligence for things that he likes to do! For all other reasons he's too lazy! :P (the name Fungii says it all)
Robotics and physics brought us together. I've worked with him on several things starting from the bot for IITB's techfest (with little coming from my side though due to my lack of experience in coding! :D )  and have had some interesting discussions with him while working side by side in ERC. Truly deservingly the sub-coordi! His coding skills are too good!
Of course, he made neural networks labs so much easier for me! That apart, we've shared one many funny memories together and I should say, Kasam se yeh meri bahut leta hai!! When he teams up with the Maharashtra mandal of the second floor of AH4, I know I'm a total goner with no respect to lose after a streak of attacks from them all! His ways in it are subtle, yet he spearheads all the prank attacks on me!   :P
No malign intended though! 
Two things are his trademark: the name Fungii and his (pale and discoloured) boxer shorts. It was never hard to recognize him from any distance! :P
Good (intellectual) company! Chill maar n enjoy life as you've always done!

<p>Fungg! Heres one physics phodu, with amazing taste in music, books and tv shows. We only got to know each other well in third year, but what a year it has been. Aoe marathons, bogmalo nights, and that concentration chamber night at velinds!. CrimeMasterGogo is also one of the few people whos seen and loved the Wire! He has this very chilled out demeanour and yet he phodofies every course, well except Opti (Taare Zameen Par...remember?) . Its been amazing being with this guy, last sem will be even more EPIC!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>The Fungus is fellow Physics fellow, and manages to do well after dismissing the life out of the subject. Huge Beatles phan, he's also got a thing for the arts. Appreciates Pu La and Pulp Fiction with equal fervour, and knows a mind-boggling number of pornstar names. Very vocal about being from Parle Tilak, he's one guy who goes all out when having a good time, and verbally pwns people he does not like. One of the few people who I can talk at length with about any subject. One of the prospects for some path-breaking research in the next few years. Keep calm, Zandu balm.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Fungiii!!!  Extempore brilliance. Reads stuff just before the exams and despite that, does well. A very original guy. He is one of those people who really doesn't give a damn about what others guys think.. Always a pleasure at Bogmallo (If i have got to find you sometime, I would rather start looking for you at John's ;). And with that witty sense of humor(I would know that part quite well since it was against me that he used to pull of all those tricks ;) Btw.. I always liked it) he is great to be around with. Has a really good taste of music. Porcupine tree yo \m/ and several other bands which you and Jinx used to suggest during the classical mechanics class (whenever you bothered to come :p).. It was great to have you around with that signature individuality and I-dont-give-a-fuck-all-I-need-is-an-old-monk… I will always remember that spontaneous panache. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Fungii.. !!! :-D :-D My NOCTURNAL SAVIOUR ! Whenever he pinged me at night,you knew something awesome was coming ! I can hardly thank  him for understanding the need of the hour and delivering freshly complied notes at my door-step just when i was about to ask for it , through-out the semester ! :) Ishaan doesn't believe in attending classes at all ! He loves to get screwed before the exams, grasps as much as he can, gets the paper and stares at his own impossibly possible excellence ! And this process goes on consistently ! I Sometimes envy him for his efficiency ! ;) I know that he loves music and sieves out a nice selection of songs for me at the dullest hour of the night that completely strikes my chords ! That's really sweet of you :) And not only does he like music, he likes life in general and is a one of those person who seldom holds any grudges against people ! His motto is "Live and let live" and though simple, its really inspiring because of the way he illustrates it ! :) I have known him for not a very long time, but it feels as if we were bound to be friends ! Very smart , very funny, especially the way he laughs ! :) U wont laugh at the joke, but will surely laugh because of his laugh ! Btw, today's short insane 'physics -khatam-ho-gaya' dance was hilarious and very mood-lifting ! Well, we have one more year to go and I hope to explore more fun out of you ! :) Cheers ! :) ------Gargi !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gargi-biswas">Gargi Biswas</a></p>
