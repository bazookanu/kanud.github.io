<h1 class="page-title">Ishan Joshi</h1><p>I have always found Ishan's company to be great fun. He has always had an immense amount of energy and intellect. His programming skills has not only brought him glory, but has been the primary source of  code for numerous people. His ever-growing passion for photography has been an inspiration for me and many others. I'm sure we'll all miss being your subjects in all those spontaneous photo-shoots. I'll never forget all those times we spent playing pranks on others and gaming together.
Its' been a pleasure trolling with you. Best of luck for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>Ishan, will always be remembered for his orange peel eating abilities! He is also a great programmer and a movie freak(he watched Pride & Prejudice n times on a portable device screen!). His classes with ‘Panda’ led to our groups use and abuse of the word ‘bear’. Both of us are crazy about technology, and we do have different opinions- which often lead to arguments. I guess thats one of the reasons we’re good friends! We were also two festival coordinators of the same department(DoPY) and he is probably the best videographer in it. He is a good singer too, and we really need to do a recording before leaving campus!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Ishan Joshi - one of the most honest, uncomplicated and simple goan friends I have made in BITS. He has been an active member of Dept of Photography and even been the coordinator for one Waves. Hence, as goes without saying, he is a really pro photographer. Being in CS, he has a keen interest in coding as well and I must say he is really smart with that stuff. Apart from this, we share interests in music as well! I will surely not forget the endless time pass sessions we had during the blackouts and the momentary random jams we did. As a neighbor, I always enjoy the evenings when he will be singing along with his guitar in his room ( I dont think I have complimented him on this particular point... anyways better late than never ). After all this, he is a good sportsperson as well and is one of the best badminton players on campus. On the whole, a really nice, simple and beautiful person. Best of luck for the future and Im sure whenever I want to catch up with you, I will find you online on GTalk ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>Ishan is one of the most straight-forward and simple guys I have met. I always see him walking or chatting with his 'Gang'. I really enjoyed 'Proteen', the comic strip he writes- so clean and smooth, yet witty and hilarious. Whenever I go to the third floor, there's always a stop at Ishan's. Then some small talk. Then Suraj joins in. Then it becomes a riot. Incidentally, Ishan is Ganpati's favourite...(You know why!). His photography skills are exceptional, and he can flip you with the things he does on Photoshop (to be frank, I dont know what software he uses) It was a pleasure working with him in Zephyr '11, especially the hostel video :-D. He is my 'Goan Yellow pages'-anything I need to know, places to visit, where to get a certain thing, he is the person I ask. All the best, Ishan!! Keep Proteen going strong! :))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>I've spend one of my best moments in college life with Ishan who lives just one step away from me. He is a great friend, a simple person who is always humble and has a charming personality. He is a great photographer, one of the best i've ever met. He is always ready to help you, I remember him making a video for my assignment when he had an exam the next day. He loves singing and playing guitar. I've been unintentionally listening to him singing in his room with his guitar since the 1st year and im sure both his skills have surely improved since then :D...The best quality I like about Ishan is that he is a true appreciator of things, may it be any movie or song or game or anything he always analyses it as a critic and his views are never influenced by someone else. He loves coding and is damn good at it too and has helped many people in it numerous times. He is always up to date with whats going on in the tech  world whether its mobiles, computers, cameras or anything and always provides his valuable guidance to people in this field. His love for dogs is unparalleled. I'll always cherish the moments i've spend with him ;  randomly knocking on his door and asking him what he was doing to which his reply would ALWAYS be that he is on gtalk talking to someone (GTalk by the way is an essential part of his life :P ) or chasing down rats from his room some 3-4 times or the few days i spend with him and his family at his home, or the random bakwaas we did in our corridor , the list is endless. I wish you all the very Best for your future, may you achieve what you wish for and we will surely stay in touch :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Mr. Wikipedia . The guy whose thirst for knowledge is so huge that mere slides and text books are not enough for him. I always wondered why the hell he was so much interested in protein with gtalk id and all. Then I realized it was something else. Jokes apart  Ishan is real gentleman who never takes offense no matter how much you tease him. A selfless worker who took much pride in working for DOPY and helping people remember the moments in this awesome campus forever. I still remember the help I used to get in completing MT reports from him and numerous others in the last few years in BITS and I would be eternally grateful to him for that. Always keep smiling dude and stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>I 1st met Ishan for NTSE classes (after 10th), then we became 2 math geeks at our jee training classes after which we joined CS in BITS and then DoPY, probably we'll end up in the same place (or even company) in future also :P. He is an excellent videographer and photographer. Also good at changing a normal pic to an awesome funny pic in photoshop or making some small funny videos. Well I'll always be jealous of his incredible passion for coding especially of assembly languages. He also likes to sing and play his guitar frequently and has gotten really good at it. Big fan of sports cars and motorbikes. A pet lover. Also great badminton player. He likes to try out all different computer games and be good at all of them rather than just focusing on 1. He has incredible knowledge in computers, mobiles, cameras, cars and all such other tech gadgets, so it's always preferable to take his advice before buying them. He shows a lot of maturity especially while handling everyone around him when they are in any bad condition/situation. He has great communication skills and can get along with any new person very easily. A very simple, friendly, helpful person and a great observer of everything around him. Best of luck for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
<p>Ishan is very passionate about everything he does and has an infectious sense of happiness about him. He is a great friend and has been very helpful throughout the 3 years that I have known him. He is an excellent photographer and a very good singer. Singing with him has been one of the best memories that I have over here. He has a great sense of humour and some of comics that I have seen on fb are absolutely epic! He's very courteous and well mannered and it's always very nice talking to him. It has been wonderful knowing you Proteen _/\_ Wish you all the best for your life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Ishan, firstly, he shares my birthday.. so its kind of obvious that he is awesome... he's good at whatever he lays his hands on.. and I mean it.. WHATEVER !! ...The best videographer I know, he makes the best comics.. totally ingenuine ideas ! His comes up with most awesome concept photography ( I don't know what else can I call it :P ) .. His knowledge in technical gadgets is unparalleled... and I am always surprised about he manages to stay upto date with the latest news about ALL his interests.. and the list of his interests is unending ! He's the epitome of the term "GEEK"...and his knowledge in these areas makes me very envious ! A great badminton player and an avid gamer ( I met him through AOE gaming , and in our first talk that I remember this guy convinced me to play AOE on the night before a compre exam !! )He's also a movie buff... and getting awesome at playing guitar too ! The thing I love the most about him is his dexterity in coding !! He is THE best programmer I've seen. I just love the way he goes about in debugging the problems in the code.. and I've been extremely fortunate to have him in my group for a few programming assignments.. It was one heck of an experience... I can just go on and on talking about this guy and his varied skills.. apart from all this, he's a wondrful human being.. and I must agree, he's way more mature than most of us and manages to stay calm in most complicated situations...He's a very helpful and friendly person who gets along well with anyone...Ishan, I am sure that with your skills and attitude you are going to be a very successful person in life. Stay in touch... and thanks for the awesome memories that we share ( whether debating or coding or trolling around ) .. Wish you luck for future.

<p>Well, I don't know where to start! Tall, gangly, quirky and funny, Ishan is a truly wonderful friend. He's intelligent and hard working( known him since the MuP days!) He's one of those people who's always there, lending a hand, cheering you up, or sharing in your sorrows. Technically strong, great at photography, plays awesome badminton (supposedly) and likes cake :D  Its so great knowing you, and talking to you, my ever-ping-able friend, and I wish you weren't going away next sem! Its hard to find people who share the same interests, I'm glad you're one of them. I'll never forget the Kala Academy experience, thanks a ton for that! I'm going to beat you at badminton one day. Hah. So don't you dare fall out of touch. All the very best for your future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Ishan popularly known as Proteen is one of the few people i know before coming to BITS. He was the guy who actually made us start playing AOE , then you joined DOPY and stopped playing :( . An awesome guy who loves doing random shit that makes no sense to others ( watching P&P multiple times just before maths 1 compre and then getting a D, eating oranges with their peels,etc..) He loves watching Top gear and random episodes of other Tv series. We have had some really amazing times together , though u missed out on many of pranavs Qods, the shining shoes incident and the soap powder incident, being on the ground floor . The long, completely pointless gtalk conversations abt random topics, we have had throughout our BITS life were priceless.An awesome Badminton player, great photographer and a pro at UT2004.I am lucky to have had a friend like you. All the best for your future, see you in 4-2 ... stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/param-prabhu-alvenkar">Param Prabhu Alvenkar</a></p>

<p>I strongly felt that hez a HiFi bandha who speaks only "Pro" stuff with "Pro" ppl..... that was when the first time i met him.... and Then came DoPy :P.... He was still a _/\_ in our batch in the dept with awesum VIDEOGRAPHY & Video making  skills ............. But still he was a gud frnd of mine and used to help me whenever i asked him for ..... Things changed drastically when both of us were part of WAVES co-co on behalf of DoPy.... we came to noe well abt each other.... Since it was also my 1st festival as a chief co-ordinator I enjoyed his company a lot during festival..... As a Co-ordinator  hez jus too good ....... When hez on a full swing of either enjoyment or work ,,, No 1 can stop him.. .... He can be completely relied upon while giving some work.... and can be HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL on people with his skills...... Hez a  Badminton champ in our hostel, reputed Guitarist of his corridor,an elegant singer (has a voice of his own kind), a gr8 videographer , a gifted programmer/coder (ur moodle application is simply "AWE")  and wht not!! In a nutshell hez multi talented giraffe (:P)....,... Personally hez one such person with whom evry frnd likes to hangout with ..... always in the center of the attraction  cracking jokes ( really witty & sarcastic) and cheering ppl enthusiastically...........Hez really helpful at times when we srsly need him , very much understanding,mature and finallyyy.....Funny!..... The jokes we used to crack in Co-co meetings and during WAVES were Lol!....... He has been one more such personality who has revolutionized DoPy by setting himself as an example for many things...... and is higly dedicated to Department .... which was evident when he used to help me in dept. issues even after his festival was over....... He has been one of the best buddies on campus with whom i share almost evrything i feel...... Will surely keep coming to this place to meet  this GOAN DUDE....... ALL the best for evrything BIG ANNA! ..... bye ( lets rock in 4-2 again... \m/ :P )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/m-s-sandeep">M S Sandeep</a></p>
<p>Ishan aka ProteenTM (really liked his concept of nick). Have known him since first year. I don’t remember meeting him first time. But we had great time in DoPY since 1-1. He is an excellent videographer and a very witty person. You need to listen and understand his jokes. Sometimes even think over them :P They are really good ones though. His comics are really good, especially that global maxima one.. another example of his great sense of humour... He walks like a machine or robot (:P) The way he looks is quite scary at times, some ppl can’t even stare back :P He is a good gamer, pro at subjects he likes, good observer and a tech-geek in true sense.. He is kind of person who is difficult to describe. Wish you all the best for future! Hope to stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Proteen when i first knew him and Sir Proteen nw :P (knighted himself on his 20th bday :P)
In fact the first tym v talked ws bcoz of dat..my friend pinged him frm my gtalk and started teasin him abt his id :P Till then he was just another dopy guy who ws der in control room n who i knew ws good at videography n videoeditin n someone i had blocked for a long tym on my gtalk immediately after addin coz of a particularly hideous dp :P
But once i got to knw him i realised he is much more than d dopy video guy.
Have known him only for a year but that one year has been really awesome :)
He is seriously good at too many things >.< (hurts my ego sumtyms to accept dat :P ). Firstly, after priyanka he is the youngest one in dopy ..in fact he is even younger than sum second yearites :P And yet, he is looked up at as though he's sort of an elder brother and its all coz he behaves dat mature and responsible..whether it is during the meetings or during fests or even during our trips, he can b counted upon when it comes to handling things properly.
Secondly, he is, as earlier mentioned, really gr8 at videography and videoediting and has put in many many hours into it for d same..for dopy as well as for fun oderwise (the dylan 'sad bear' vid :D). On top of that he loves coding..calls it his passion and is really gr8 at it. Oh and dats nt all, he can play guitar as well (saw a performance ystrday itself :) ) and can sing along nicely with it (That hotel california performance as i mentioned in dylan's testimonial :) Still cn hear his voice sayin dat "hotel california" part everytym i hear dat song.) And he's good at badminton too! (dis i havent had d chance to see yet). Also one of the few people i knw whose english is so damn good i have to google words he says sumtyms to find wt dey mean (h8 dat :x :P).
Oh and he loves cars! Had so many discussions on top gear wid him wid both of us tryin to show off wt v know abt cars but wid him having the last laugh unfortunately :P Is in CS bt cn still solve my doubts that i ask about my electives lyk automotive vehicles n all.
Oh and how cud i 4get >.<, ob really gr8 at photography too :) Experiments a lot!
Is more enthusisatic about and keep tracks of all the happenings in the tech world than i would have about Sherlock Holmes :P
Knows anything and everything about the lastest gadgets.
Always always there to help me when i need help. And u knw how gangsters n all have guys for everything, there'll b a gun-supplyin guy, there'll be a driver guy, der'll b a stoln-goods guy, lyk dat he's my jelly-supplying guy :P Can always rely on him for dat :)
Oh and my last minute dance partner :) (i was stupid enough to think i wud b d guy and hence went wid neha but realised dat ws nt feasible :P )Had so much fun those two weeks(minus the last day of course :P that song still haunts me >.< )
And i cant thank him and pranav enough for skyrim ! :) had so much fun playin it :P
All in all, my third year would've been much different if it hadnt been for him! A truly awesome guy, who's just as witty as he's chivalrous (always has to b d guy and treatin me lyk a girl all the tym >.<), can eat A LOt O.o , and someone i m immensely grateful for, for a lot of things! :)
Hope u get everything u want in life! :) All the best! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
