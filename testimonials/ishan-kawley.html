<p>I met him in 1st year but got to know him in 2nd year. His fun loving nature made him one of my best friends in the campus. He is rightly "the most eligible bachelor" in the campus. Spent countless hours in Monji, nesci with him. His meal cannot end without a cup of coffee.  He is always ready for a mature discussion on any topic. I am glad to have friend like you. I wish you all the best for your future en devours.... Be in touch..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>A tall handsome guy with a brilliant smile, that's Ishan. He is an amazing person at heart. Very friendly, approachable, helpful,kind, sweet...and now i am falling short of words to describe what an amazing person he is. 
I wish him loads of luck in life and hope he finds 'the one' soon, such guys shouldn't stay single for long ;P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>I really admire Ishan for the work that he has done with CEL. Being the CEL President is probably as difficult as being the President of the CSA because of the sheer magnitude and number of activities that we have around the year. And Ishan has done remarkbly well. The way he conducts meetings and manages work is comendable and this is something that I  tried to emulate in the way I handled MATRIX. Kudos! Ishan is very cheerful, humble and pleasant mannered. It has always been very nice talking to him. He's sincere, dependable, honest and quite simply a very nice person. He has a brilliant approach to problem solving and is very clear headed when it comes to dealing with issues. Naturally, this means that he is always full of fantastic ideas. Even after we pass out of BITS, I hope that I get an opportunity to work with him again. That'll be awesome. :) I'm sure that you are going to achieve grand success in your life. I wish you all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>

<p>As President of CEL, Ishan was an inspiration to work with. 
Always calm and cheerful, never getting flustered handling everything practically on his own, it's been a pleasure knowing him.
Hope you always stay the same.
Good luck:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Ishan, I first knew him when someone told me that for thermodynamics, he is the man to approach. He converted my D to comfortable C. I must say that like all other, i am too mesmerized by his aura. If someone writes definition of a  complete man, one should end up with "ishan" as example. I look to him if i have any problem, and he never disappoints me. He is so much fond of DJ nights that he will be the first person to hit there and the last person to leave. No matter how much dusty, humid condition prevails, he is busy with his dance. (By the way he likes gossiping) :P He has potential for literally everything, be it studies, dance , music any thing. Though use of those potential is subjected to his interest. Now, when i am getting testimonials mentioning my blogs, many of my blogs are the child of our chit-chat from hostel to nescafe. Yes, he is fond of monginis, nesci too. If he goes to library, he spents halfof his time sipping coffee or tea at either if the two places. Though I am jealous of his abilities, but yes i do love him.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
