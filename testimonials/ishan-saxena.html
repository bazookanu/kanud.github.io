<h1 class="page-title">Ishan Saxena</h1><p>You were my first friend in Bits and since then we have just shared each and every day of our lives..going through all sorts of highs and lows together..laughing, fighting, cribbing,bunking or just doing nothing..But with you I never needed anything or anyone else..and thats what is amazing about you..U really have got it all figured..whether its what should I do about my problems..or where to go eat for dinner..!! For all those who dont know him well, heres a tip- he is a very gud friend..all you need to do is trust him, give him a bit of space,and be honest. He is funloving, likes to remain chilled out (so m telling from personal experience,dont play with his temper :P), but cares a lot about things( although he wont admit it ever:P). He is intelligent and very clear in concepts but prefers to have one more hour of sleep(:P)One of the very few I have met who dedicates himself totally into what he likes..he is very good in things he chooses to do..He has a certain charisma in his personality,a very good speaker, its hard to beat him in an argument..mischieveous at times, and with a wonderful sense of humor..I assure you u ll never be bored with him..
I just want to say that u have been with me through the years..helping me come out of all the lows..and sharing all my happiness..bearing with my endless bakwas..we have shared many great memories..those awsum road trips to palolem..the kfc addiction..long hours in the lib..the big big fights..and the n moments of teasing and laughter..I am really going to cherish it all..!! And although i know u will say that this is not the end, but yaa its the end of a phase..and I hope that u acheive all that you desire from your life..!! (baki me to hu hi dimak khane ke liye hamesha :P) Just be yourself forever..coz no one can compete with  the awsumness u have.. and i dont know what i would without you..! Keep smiling..!! All the best.!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tapsi-dubey">Tapsi Dubey</a></p>
<p>Netaji is the shaitan khopdi of our group,simply bindass and ready to do any chudaap any time of the day.spent awesome time with him all these years,taught him 'how to tolerate jokes on self' :P :D.his peculiar laugh and those funny expressions that he makes is an epic sight.But besides all this he is very intelligent and a very good friend.knowing all the godlike people around him (that includes me) he still dared to enter our group :D and successfully passed the test and now is one of the core members of our group.All the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
