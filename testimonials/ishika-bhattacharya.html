Oh what to say about this girl…she is a total fun….very intelligent, topper of the class… honestly she studies just before exams... she has supper brilliant neurons !! ;)
She is very helpful, charming with beautiful big eyes… there are some extreme things about her..like she hates every species  of insects … hates curd, milk..even smell of it… loves to go for outings..shooping with her is lot of fun… Also she is a very sweet teacher …her explaining skills are too good…. Her room though it is always sort of messy.. is study room for us…So Ishika …god bless u dear …may u win noble prize one day in nano research !! :D
