<h1 class="page-title">Ishita Gupta</h1><p>I may not be that good at expressing myself but whatever I am writing down is straight from my heart because whatever I am writing is for a person who has got the purest heart,soul and conscious......ISHITA........ her calmness, caring attitude,concern,commitment to friendship,sensibility all in a single person is THE thing which make her stand apart from rest of the crowd.She is a person whom you can trust to to any extreme, she is one who might or might not be by your side in your happy times but will always be ready to support in your bad times,she is the one person who never asks for anything in return,a kind of person difficult to find in today's world.It was a privilege to have a friend like you.The time,the trips,the outings,the classes,the moments shared with you will be cherished through out life.It won't be easy to depart from a true friend like you.You will always be deeply missed, not just by me but all those people who had opportunity to share moments with you.
Please be the way you are because you are the best the way you are, and I am sure this nature of yours will get you long in life and help you achieve the best of all happiness in life.I wish God could make more persons like you and bless all with a friend like you.May God fulfill all your dreams.All my best wishes for your future.....!!!!!!!!  :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kapil-aggarwal">Kapil Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>I really don't remember when we started talking..but your presence has always been comforting to me. Its funny how we spend days without talking but end up sharing our darkest secrets ;) I never gave u a proper card (u know me :P) so here comes everything that i wanted to say.. Ishita is one of the greatest friends I got in college..coz she's just dere..always..when i need tea late nite..when i don't have my laptop to watch pretty little liars..and even to discuss if i should study or sleep :P With her, it somehow feels family..!! I am really gonna miss our untimely chats about everything..and just wanna say that whatever life brings to you..don't ever change..coz not many people are left in this world with as pure and serene personality as yours..hope u get all that u dream of (should be realistic though :P) ..!! just love u gal..!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tapsi-dubey">Tapsi Dubey</a></p>
<p>"Do I know you" i said, "I'm Anjali's friend "you replied. These were our first words when we had chat on fb for the first time. You've been a good friend of mine since then. You're the MOST genuine girl I've met on campus. You're gentle, calm, helpful and always willing to go beyond your comfort zone to help your friends. It's always been fun to hang out with you, be it a voyage on Palolem beach or Dancing in Royal Orchid or tasting Spicy stuff at Jones... For me, you're an epitome of benevolence... I've never seen you cribbing for anything but still you listen to everyone's grief and always willing to provide a helping hand. Every moment spent with you will be imbibed in my heart for years to come. Always be the way you are, Dont change yourself...
Finally I wish you best of luck for all your future endeavors and have a great life ahead...!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

<p>Hmm .. Ishita ..!!  Ek Changli mulgi ... .. my most obedient student .. always ready to learn something from me ..  She has been my student from the 1st holidays on campus . I must say she is a fast learner .. I taught her marathi , gujurati , bhindi banana , car driving , photography etc etc effortlessly ...  She has always said that she considered me as an inspiration and has always been under the aura of the multiple talents I have .. She has the unique ability of copying me in every situation possible and succeeds most of the time .. A continuous expectation of tr8s  on small matters  has been the USP of our relationship .. U own me a dozen of tr8s .. actually more than 25 if counted from the day 1. very ignorant you are about this ... A very competitive photographer who tries hard to click photos as special as i do .. and has has gone on to the limits of changing 3-4 phones having cameras upto 5 mega pixel or more as compared to my 2mp camera but all in vain .. I can only say .. dont worry .. practice makes a man perfect ..In spite of all this you are a person with  an OMG  nature .. the best nature a girl can have .. no crying , and cribbing about things .. I find you one of the most interesting and genuine  persons to talk to .. You are a great listener and always comforting evryone in their tough times . Be it less marks , gf/bf  ka locha  or anything else ..  your sheer presence makes one feel relieved .. You have this unique ability to feel other's heart and how one wud be feeling in any particular situation .. I still remember incidents where you actually asked me kya hua when evryone was busy in their own world .. and then followed by the words   "bataaa deyyyyy" after evry denial ...!!  You will always be missed as one of my most dear girl+frnd who i can actually talk about anything with the belief that it would stay to u ..!! One can be sure of all the help possible from u r side without expecting something in return ... except tr8s .. bhukkad ..!!  A great and caring person who knows the importance of relationships and gives them top priority irrespective of the present condition.. you are not dumbo as evryone calls you , just innocent , also which evryone knows . Also you copied me in my love for dogs .. jsut when i told you I loved them .. you brought murphie ..!!  Limits  ...haha :P. He is indeed very cute but landed up in wrong place between wrong people .. # tragedy   :( ..!!. Also you have a trdaemark way of getting scared ..!!  which I can only laugh on .. ;) , You look very cute when high on __ life  :P You will always be among the few persons whom i cannot afford to dishearten ...!!  I respect you for what you are and you will continue to hold that place for long time to come .. Keep smiling always and mujhe bhulne ka to sawalich ni uthta ..!!  chal ab tr8 ..!!  :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
<p>Ishitaaaa... you are one of the best people I have met! a great great friend! The earliest memories with you I remember were when we would sit beside each other when we went to shahi or somewhere outside and I would pass comments at other people around us and you would try to stop yourself from laughing.. everytime you would say "shreya aaj kuch mat bolna, main hass dungi" :P the time spent with you in bits has been great and i am lucky to have known someone as "saaf-dil" as you  :) all the best for the future yaar.. i will really miss you and anjali in campus! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreya-kedia">Shreya Kedia</a></p>
<p>"Shittaaaaaaaa" ....that is how I used to refer her and she used to get mighty pissed with me ....!!!Met this girl in 1-2 ......and at first glance she came off as a studious ,sincere and introvert  who would demand the moon in return for uttering a word ...:P!!!This was my first impression but "first impression is not always the last impression ....." .....come summer vacation when we were both jobless we got to know each other better through long chats on gtalk ....:D!!!!!Then came second year which though was filled with turbulence turned out to be the high point of our friendship ........the numerous outings , the zillion "suddenly planned " dinner trips , the voluminous amount of time spent in hanging out with each other ... and a lot more made it one of the most cherished periods of my life .....!!!!!Then came the mother of all revelations in third year which left me pleasently surprised .......:D!!!!!!I have teased you no ends by just using a four letter word ...:P..and now that we part ways in a few days time I feel sorry and happy about it ,.....:D!!!!!!You are one of the most selfless ,genuine and understanding person I have ever come across in life .........always the one to concede and always a patient listener ...your kind is a rarity ....:)!!!!Thank you for all that you have done for me ......and sorry for all the times I have wronged you .....!!!I wish you all success in your life and may you get everything that you wish for (everything including ___________:P)in life .........!!!!!Thanks for being there for me .....:)!!!!All the best for the life ahead...:)!!!1<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-choudhury">Rahul Choudhury</a></p>
