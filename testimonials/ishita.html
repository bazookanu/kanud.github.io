<h1 class="page-title">Ishita</h1><p>"Morning shows the day";"Half begun is almost done"-If you go by phrases like this then my friendship with Ishita would be over before it began.I had met not on the college,rather outside my tuition center,the cold shoulder she gave,I was in for a toss.But luck has it own way and we end up in the same college.For a year of almost no talk to sharing a 36 hour long journey,things changed for good,so good that the following month she ended up my sis(Reason:Chocloates,she loves having them and I love gifting,so the mutual symbiosis),being more specific we liked each other's company.I love talking and she listening,not only listening but sometimes even scolding,hitting(only if I am worng).She is a blend of cuteness and intelligence,someone who reflects independence  both through actions and decisions.She will always stand by herself and her values,a quality which is a rareity.She will always walk the extra mile(Sometimes two or three)just for the sake of happiness of others. Given the talent she posses along with the firm belief in herself,I can say sky is the limit for her. All the best sweet sis :) :)(Dare you forget me !!!)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>ishita! I met you in my second year and since then we have spent quite sometime together. I have always admired your dedication towards studies, and your principles in life.You are sweet,sensitive, pretty ( chinki :P), a great singer and a brilliant paintor ( you still have to paint my portrait someday :P). Extremely fond of food, chocolates in particular, she is my non-veg food partner :P. I shall miss the outings we have had together, dressing up for certain occasions, discussions at mongi and IC etc. Always keep smiling and stay in touch! :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>
<p>Ishita you are the sweetest girl I've met on campus! I remember those first few days on campus, you would come to my room and wake me up for breakfast on Sunday mornings because nobody else would wake up. Always hungry this girl! Apart from that you are this perfect girl who is pretty, smart, extremely sweet and a wonderful artist. And when I say a wonderful artist, I really mean it, I'm seriously a huge fan of all your paintings I've seen so far! Also I cannot help mentioning that its awesome the way you sing "chacarron" :D Thanks for being the sweetest neighbor for all these years. I'll definitely miss you a lot. Love you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>Ishita!! I got to know you in my third year, when we attended  or rather you attended those maths classes! I have to say the only reason my maths year went reasonably good was only thanks to your notes, Thanks a lot for that! An extremely helping, caring, sweet and one of the cutest people i have met.All the best for future! Stay in touch! :)

<p>Ishita....if there was ever a living example of what they say 'Beauty with Brains', it has to be you. You are cuteness personified (I still believe you should have won the Cutie Pie award :D). You are great in acads (not to forget your 82/80 in Algebra I compre :P) and always ready to help others. I will always cherish the long chat we had in IC and the amazing Math trip to Anjuna. Your smile is enough to lighten even the toughest of situations. I am sure you will do well in CS and also in your future endeavors. I hope we remain friends for many years to come and hope that I am never a victim of your Karate moves :P. Thanks for being such a lovely friend and all the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>

<p>A most short-tempered girl with a heartening smile and great choice of music.. Ishita knows the right things to say, even to the wrong kind of people. A super-fun nerd, standing tall amongst others! And a darn good person to go for advice... Oh yeah! She also got a great eye for art! People get older with age, but she only gets cuter :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-tiwari">Akshat Tiwari</a></p>
<p>Our uncannily similar preferences in most of the things (food, people, clothes, music, movies, subjects, etc) has led to numerous animated chats and discussions in the past 3 years, She has grown, from a little (extra-tall) kid in the first year, to, well, what she is now. A lot has been said about cuteness so wont repeat again. A great person to hang out with and sometimes, when she passes by you, you feel like "aaah...girls...!"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jayant-dalmia">Jayant Dalmia</a></p>
<p>Ishiiiiiiiii... how can one be sooooooo cute and adorable. Such down to earth, sweet n amazing person. A great artist, lovely singer, awesome at acads and a pro karate-girl. Not to forget a huge lover of food. You are one of the ppl who contributed towards making all three years of my BITS life so memorable. All those times when you would come to room to have little chats about random things ... the ni8 outs wen you would be the first one to go to sleep :P.. the opti classes and studying together (got to know many others sides of you) ... those singing sessions of u and pinku (btw i love your voice) and many others... all are really close to me. But all these years you never taught me tayakundu :P. I am glad we met.. thanx for being such a lovely friend..Also thank you for adding some  beautiful songs to my music list. 
Keep smiling, Keep in touch, Love you<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/garima-agarwal">Garima Agarwal</a></p>

<p>Ishita!! (now m wondering why dont you have  a surname?? :P) 
I gt 2 know ishita initially as sum guy had crush on you and was asking around gals to sumhow befriend you!! :P poor you!
I got to know you pretty late, guess during the time you teaching Singhi to sit in chair and not hide under the table! It was fun wid you around in dose chasing laddu n kajal and singhi!!! 
Ishita is d sweetest  aand the most helpful person around! And i love the way you go all cute n chinky eyes widout your glasses!! Guess  We do have another year to catch up!! tc!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shahzarin">shahzarin</a></p>
<p>I could adopt you, you know! The way I have taken care of you, since 1-2, you have been like a princess to me.. like a little cherished baby, who I felt is mine, who I took immense pleasure in taking care of.. who I thought will go crazy and lost without me, which you did! Unarguably the cutest person I have met, extreme child-like.. with amazingly funny and entertaining expressions.. Extra-ordinarily sensitive and emotional ( she might cry if someone sneezes! :P )


I can laugh about your silly things when I am alone for hours ( I actually do that when I am in Mumbai ). All the ranchi jokes, the way you get possessive about it, the way you hate my regional bias, our food and sleep arguments, the attempts you make to get me off my laptop, your chicken cravings, your amazing sitting styles and pink talks :P you are one hell of an entertaining person.. maybe that’s the reason I handled SO many of your tantrums from you :P that, and the fact that I love you, I might not love my own kid so much :D


All I hope is, the Chinki-Pinki never break apart.. over the years, a lot of people have come into your life, and mine too. We have shifted our priorities, have had amazing fights (well, the whole hostel heard those.. ), have found new people and left them too.. but it’s like a spring which binds us.. however far I go, physically, emotionally and mentally, I have to come back to you. To tell you what happened in my day, how I didn’t study atall, how you hated the mess food today, how some stupid random guy sent me a message today and how someone whistled at you at shopco, how excited you are about the chicken+jalebi day, how our other silly friends were so irritating unlike you.. “It’s not like I HAVE to tell her, it just comes.. it’s a natural thing, if she is there, I just say it anyway..”.. not for your opinions ( duh as if those would be smart enough :P ), not for the understanding, not for venting things out.. but just because it’s you! :’)


Anyway, fun thing is, CH5 320 will have Anmol Srivastava for you next sem.. Don’t kill her please. :P no one will be as wonderful neighbor to you as I was (OBB!!!), and although you have my sympathies, I am secretly extremely smug and (very)happy about it! I want you to miss me, because I know I will. i will look forward to calls from both of you, and I know your respective cribbing will bring a wonderful smile to my face, when ill be there all alone, without any of you! Grow up a little bit for the next sem, and I can make it up to you by being extra-angelic when I come back. Love you loads!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritisha-laungani">Ritisha Laungani</a></p>

<p>Chinki!!My childhood friend.well this testimonial has been due for almost a decade.Lets see.When was the first time we met?class 6th?class 7th?I think the first time I talked to you was in class 7th and you used to be a mystery girl back then(you never spoke!).Gradually and thankfully you did and since then we have had amazing times together.Remember class 8th when all of us used to sit in the last row and do nothing but tp all day long-the monday tests,the geography classes and (:P)...well you know what transpired in the later half(read,january) of class 8th.I still think that year was the best year we have had together.And then class 12th!!the nerdy ishita!you and your silly jokes and your never ending chocolate craving!You have been an amazing friend.From acads to personal life problems-you and the other three have helped me like no one else would ever have.Still remember the scoldings and advices you gave me in 11th(rally thankful).We have a fair share of secrets and lets not delve into those.I was so happy when you said we are going to the same college!!Although we might not meet that much in college or back home(i hate you for that) you will always have a special place in my heart. No words can describe how amazing a person and a friend you have been.It has been such a great 9-10 years being your friend!!I wont be asking you to keep in touch cause i know ranchi is always there and we will be always there in ranchi,hoping that some time you will agree to join us in our bizarre outings!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-prakash">Pranav Prakash</a></p>
