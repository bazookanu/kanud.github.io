<h1 class="page-title">J Harish</h1><p>Ah? Ah?! Ah?!?! Well that’s how I guess I met harish. He definitely makes a great first impression but don’t be trapped by his innocent looks. After our first conversation, thinking of all those crappy questions asked by him, I first thought he was completely nerdish and of course an asshole. But less I know that he is a complete ..no a perfect asshole..love u bitch :D. Harish jayanti.. He calls himself an open book.. yeah u sure are one (haha kidding.. I am never gng to agree :D) , My favorite komti partner :P ( what’s the status of AV- Goa chapter? ) , Witty (LOL), Sarcastic(In your dreams :P), Humorous that’s harish in some unsuitable words. I am sure u get this but I have say it.. dude u have an awkward(typo..awesome*) walking style. And god knows what is wrong with your tummy :D.  Jokes apart, he is always open to heart and is always cheerful. Even though sensitive at heart he ll for sure gives u courage and stands your problems in your toughest phases. I can never forget all the kamapanti we did together, “punches” we exchanged, pranks we played (remember the coat incident?! :P) , dances we did(thanx for being my gal partner :P) , talks we had(stupid though) , Times I beat u ( like a boss :D) , all those night canteen night outs , parcels u bought for me and ash after our very own ayurvedic session, laughter we had, memories u have shared, Songs u have sung, those awesome train journeys we had, food we shared( in 9:1 ratio may be) , all those hydarabadi hindi conversations we had, all those bargaining’s u did, accidents u made, dilemma’s u were in,. I am greatful for bits for admitting some one soo stupid and sweet like you. Sensitive, caring, loving, intelligent, optimist, honest….that’s harish in some words. Dude u better opt for a psychiatric profile in your near future :P. Don’t even go near to chemical. U suck at it!!( at least I don’t wanna see you in that profile..remember the deal?!... we are supposed to hate chem. :P ) . You shd stop staying invisible on fb and gtalk…and learn some CS. Idiot, i know we ll be in touch and now I don’t know how to end this without saying good bye or gng a bit psenti. Stay alive bitch!!(Sounds good, aint it?!)

<p>My neighbour who is a complex creature, Harish - harish 'ga', that is - has been a constant friend for these 3 yrs. All those times he came to my room and begged for the flute!! Once in our life at BITS he must have asked me to wake him up but somehow everytime when he meets me in the morning, he says 'utaya nai yaar'. wtf. But the fact remains that he has been a decent audience to many of my songs, and a good audience at that. And also a good friend, easy to talk to and easy to pester. Don't go on blaming me for that aero-d thing for the rest of your life, given that i gave the parts to you! But we did have fun and that's what i'm gonna miss. Most importantly, i'll miss being your neighbour. Goodluck see you in 4-2!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
