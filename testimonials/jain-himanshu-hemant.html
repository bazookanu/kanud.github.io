<h1 class="page-title">JAIN HIMANSHU HEMANT</h1><p>Himanshu aka GETCRACKED aka chu aka chudaap aka hj aka Singham
All the nicks above just reminded me how he got each nick in different semesters . I still remember the time when me ,him and Tomar studied together and he benifited the most after which he was thrown out from group study as he was found guilty of snatching the luck. He is one of the most intelligent person I have ever met but not at all hard-working.
I always wondered why gujjus are called KANJUS and then I met him and now I stand here having no doubts.
Hj whether you take bath or not u will always be a great friend and a great companion to hang around with. Its been a very special journey with you and hope to continue for a long long time.
PS: Do not take that bath thing seriously…..naha liya kar, nahi to paas rehna mushkil ho jaata he :D

<p>HJ the dude as we all call him is a great frnd of mine. Although he joined our grp a little late but boy his entry was nthng short of ajay devgan style. He was the most studious guy of our grp in first sem but today he redefines li8ness ( exam ke 2 ghante pehle chudaap hindi muvi dekhna choti baat nahi hoti ). Respect 4 u. It’s always funny to listen to the fight between him and baba over the issue kaun mahine mein jaada nahata hai and the winning score is like 10-12 in favour of baba. I truly believe he deserves an award for that and should be the face of poster citing ‘Save Water’. A sharp and spontaneous mind, he could certainly achieve anything he wants. I personally feel he is the luckiest guy I’ve ever came across and at times it seem he steals others luck too :D ( well just kidding ). We all (me Hj and grp ) hv been to some great places together and did some wackiest thng I couldn’t possibly have imagined. It’s been absolutely fun to be with u for past 3 yrs and wish you a great, happy and successful life and career ahead…. Never underestimate yourself and live life to fullest!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>
<p>HJ the dude, the chu(irony), the singham, most importantly GETCRACKED.. u are seriously a lucky lucky bastard.. never seen or heard of this kind of showering of luck that u r blessed with.. bas shower k niche aa jaaya kar once in a while.. :D

<p>HJ is a li8, fun loving and bindass guy. I have rarely seen him tensed. He is the kind of guy who will start and finish his work in the 11th hour. He has the brain of a genius but limits its potential by his laziness. He can achieve whatever he wishes to. A CS, poker and an excellent chess player. I wish him all the best for his future and may he excel in life. Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rajat-koujalagi">Rajat Koujalagi</a></p>
<p>Gujju dude. The guy with the awesome hairstyle next only to Chujaat. Jokes apart I think you are a real nice guy with a big heart and a chu brain. Always the one with the jokes. The new year 2012 was awesome. Although we ended up in you know where at the end it still seemed good due to you all guys. Chu Club_/\_. Best of luck for CAT.
