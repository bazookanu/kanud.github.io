<h1 class="page-title">jammy srikanth</h1><p>Srikanth : i feel weird calling you srikanth because no one does(i never did) so Jammy!! The first thing anybody notices about you is your witty nature and never give up attitude. You are always positive in whatever you do and are never afraid of any situation. With your attitude and desire you can succeed anywhere you go in the world. You are the most frank, truthful,helping, caring and genuine person i have encountered in BITS. From the combined studies in 2-1 to the never ending labs in 3-2 and from the trips we've been a part of to the countless hours we spent at IC just chatting i'll remember each of them and i cannot even start counting the infinite times you make us all laugh with your jokes. The thing I like about you most is that in any situation you'll always stay cool and composed (just like dhoni :P ). I should also mention your love for pictures of yourself and all the weird poses you give for them (most of them good though :) ). Your one my best friends that I earned during these 3 years and hope you'll always be in touch. Every aspect of you is unique and refreshing and i wish you with all my heart a huge success in all your future endeavors(especially ENI :P ) and a happy and peaceful life!! Cheers!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>

<p>Not Jammy its Jimmy. He was my workshop partner. Listening him speaking in Hindi was hilarious. But he didn’t mind trying. You won’t feel bored when he’s around. He would try something to make u laugh. Has a good sense of humour. A stylish person, likes to dress up. A good person at heart, he speaks his heart out. I have always cherished his company. From workshop to never ending labs it’s been a wonderful time with him. The chitchat at IC and labs. I have troubled him soo much in the labs and in the classes but he still held his calm. A good friend. I hope he succeeds in his future plans.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Jammy !! A Die hard Aamir fan. A guy who follows all his shows and movies and yes.. keeps on asking others to do the same.. :P Especially me !! :D One quality he is best at is talking about life !! He can give endless lectures to help you solve your problems !! And those are indeed true.. ! :) One guy who is totally carefree...loves cricket like crazy.. and is extremely funny.. :P He has his own style of enjoying everything he does.. :) !! Jammy, you are so much fun to be with..!! So friendly, helpful and at the same time someone who knows where he is supposed to reach in life.. You hindi is the truly amazing... (seriously) :P !! One person who stays calm and composed no matter whatever happens..(perhaps his best quality) :P :) !

<p>Jammy, a crazy little freak who spreads his charm wherever he goes....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This rascal has pissed me off a lot of times by his lame wisecracks which however intended to make every1 laugh ( I still wonder y am I the only targeted one...:x). He is one of "da" dudes among the ones I know. He is a great philosopher who gives great advices, half of them he himself doesn't follow. He is a great friend and we are always the top priority for him.....hahaha....Who am I kidding....."ladki mili tho patli gali...dost khali wali".....:D. Though many of them donno, he is a big kameena but always a great friend to be with. He is very humorous at times but a very sensitive guy from inside. A big sports freak who is still trying to work on his abs....God knows when!!!!!!!!!!!! This seems to be a bit sarcastic from my side which i am sure he is gonna kick my ass for my comments.....but buddy truth prevails!!!!!!!..:P.
  I am sure that any number of years from now...he will be pulling somebody's leg or the other..This is Jammy and my BFF....Wish u luck and a good lyf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/j-harish">J Harish</a></p>
<p>The name rings Jingle bells for everyone who knows him. Highly Enthusiastic and Energetic. He has the best mimic skills I have ever seen. He is humble and gives a lot of value to everyone he cares about. He is always jovial and a fun loving guy to be around with. Hidden in him is a very good planner who always thinks in all possible ways to optimize the situation. He always is happy and keeps everyone lively. He is one of the most happening persons i have seen. One peculiar quality you would notice about him is he analyzes any situation in all possible ways until you are exhausted :P Analysis king :D . A highly practical person. Hez the “dude” as we refer to him. Highly motivational and pretty sensitive at heart (but then again not too much psenti :P)  A chatter box , he can continuously speak for hours at a stretch without boring the audience (I cant do that for more than 10 min :D  damn you :P) . Jammy, I can never forget those long walks with you at all possible odd times on and around campus at all possible odd places :D , those jogs where you were always 2 rounds ahead of me, the mess you have made after going to Bogmalo , Speeches you have made , philosophies u spoke about, moments when u have seen some video and then just kept blabbering about it to every first person u see after watching that video , dances we did , Pranks we played with you know whom, and last but not the least Jokes you have cracked :P.My best reading partner:P. He is always open to anything and most happily welcomes change. He adapts himself very well in to any situation and mingles very easily with just about anyone (Excellent survival skills!! :P). Hidden in him is a great story teller too!! . he loves working out and I am jealous of you when u are regular and disciplined and for getting in to Bio and getting all those easy grades and projects you got (You are doing your cop under ?? :P) And if I keep on writing it’s a never ending story between you and me so I guess I will “pause” here and we ll rock The Bells in our 4-2 so the psenti part can wait. Damn you, I am gonna miss u buddy ..pch :(.Lots of new experiences are waiting out there to be conquered by you, Bon Voyage for the rest of the journey of your life!!
Signing off till then,

<p>Well Jammy I hardly know you before 2nd semester but after 2nd semester Jammy became one of my closest friends in my life, I don’t think that there is a thing that Jammy doesn’t tell me. One of the greatest attributes of you is your open mindedness to allow change. You always want to change to be a better person. Trust me I ve known you since my 2nd sem there’s a hell lot of difference between Jammy in 2nd sem and the present Jammy. 
Jammy in 2nd sem :  ”yeah he is cool”
Jammy now  :  ”oh this guy, he is damn awesome!!” .
Jammy is pretty good at giving advices (but they don’t work for him :P ) whenever you have a problem just talk to him he ll give you the best possible advice. Jammy you have a great sense of humor and I envy you for that. You can easily change the atmosphere around with your situation related jokes. We did a lot of stuff together……….all the pranks that we played together on  Ashwin , Krishna murty , Harish,....the list goes on ……… Remember CAS compre exam where we tried to copy but failed to do so( I admit it was my fault ) anyway next year we have many more subjects like “cas” so lets try it again :P , walking from c mess to hostel in the farthest root possible , goin to night canteen almost everyday during exams, mutual exchange of philosophies and a lot of “other stuff”  that I can’t tell here(you know what I mean :P ). You were always there for me during my tough times thanx for that. You ve developed a great philosophy of life I hope you continue with that all the best to you.
