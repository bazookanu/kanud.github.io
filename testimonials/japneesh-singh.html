<h1 class="page-title">Japneesh Singh</h1><p>Japneesh Singh aka Bhalla aka Schei√üe (Google Translate its meaning ;) ). Met him in PS1. He is a really friendly person and down to earth. He is a simple guy and it is his simplicity that attracts people the most. The first impression you get of him is that he is sleeping while he is talking to you but trust me, his mind his totally at work :P He is very intelligent and I wish him a great and successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Bhalla aka Japneesh. On my first encounter i thought he would be just like any other sardar, crazy and full of masti. But eventually it turned out wrong. He's very passionate about movies, football, German. Bhalla is the only person to give reviews by reading wiki pages. Everything apart. Japneesh is a cool guy. He's always ready to give new ideas, really helpful in troubleshooting. Now we are blessed wen bhalla graces us with his presence. Days would pass by and bhalla was found only in his room, kabhi nikalta hi nahi tha. He was always the common person to get GPL in everyones birthday. Bhalla is a cool guy, the unique sardar with human qualities. All the best for his future waise abhi ek saal baki hai!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Japneesh Singh is a sum of a contradictions. First up you see his Sardar visage and immediately you get a punjabi song running through your head. Then you hear him speaking and it douses cold water on your daydream. The first day I met him, he could barely get his voice out. I thought he must be a lamb. But the intervening years proved me wrong :P. He has to be one of the most "wolf in sheepskin" kind of person around. We argue a lot about movies and the final verdict is that he thinks my choices are lame, while I think his choices are boring...after two weeks he usually agrees with me :P. Apart from that he has a tendency to get all worked up about stuff and then letting all the air escape because he is just too lazy to go ahead with it :P. But seriously speaking he has to be one of THE most imaginative people around with a passion for football (supports a loser team), books(is too slow a reader) and movies (has shitty taste in them). He tries to be interested in TV shows (and has thrown a LOT of good recommendations my way) but mostly his shitty taste in movies make him fall flat on his face again. All in all, he is a cool person to hang out with with something interesting to say always. P.S. even though he tries to exaggerate about his disinterest towards academics, he does quite well in them too in spite of all the shenanigans he pulls.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>
<p>What to say about him! He's very simple, sometimes too much I guess. But still a very honest person, crazy in some ways and a good nice guy to hang out with. He reads a lot, his best admirable quality. To the core a "die-hard" Liverpool fan, and an anime lover (just like me except he don't like Naruto >.< , don't know why :-/ ) One quality which I don't like about him is - he's an introvert, which I believe he has to turn down a little bit. I will miss the calmness on his face seriously!, very few on campus have such charm. And to end I wish him all the very best for a damn! great future :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>

<p>Japneesh aka balla, I feel you are the most silent person in the corridor and I never knew you properly as there were very few situations we had a chit chat :P. You are very helpful in acads and also helped me when I am in need during holidays. Great fifa player and good in studies. I like the way you, jessi and kkd (of course one more is missing here) spend the nights. I miss you all and please keep in touch buddy.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>He is 'The Bhalla' - Beyond a shadow of doubt the most lovely surd i have ever met.. I remember when Prabhat gave u that name.. nd it stuck ever since.. Its has become ur identity now.. so much so that 'Japneesh' seems to be a sub rosa name.. :D This guy just doesn't feel bad about anything.. When the atmosphere is gloomy nd boredom is all that resides in the corridors.. and when suddenly you hear someone shout out 'Bhalle.. Bahar nikal' and then those vibrations reach each and every room in the vicinity.. Just fills u up with an elated sense of joy and mischief.. 'Chalo.. Ab thodi masti karte hain'.. U have been the reason for the high happiness quotient of our corridor man and i'm nothing but real glad i met a person like you!! Insanely Sharp in studies.. _/\_ Saved my ass in so many courses.. I've stopped counting.. He talks about my movie knowledge.. And i will be nothing but ashamed if comparing the same with this guy.. He is a Die Hard fan of cinema.. You have had so much influence on me brother in this respect.. thank you for that!! And i love beating you in Table Tennis.. :D Needless to mention the amazing time we had in our PS1.. The late night walks and eat outs at Sam's Restro.. Waking up to ur insane scary laughter.. and not to forget.. The Counter-strike \m/ - that ruled big time!! I am still quite eager to finish the movie that we once started.. We have one more semester to work it out.. Hoping for the director to Step Up!! ;)

<p>Man !! You know me better than anyone else i guess . Remember the day when we had to walk  back to campus  around 3-4 kms coz we got down at the wrong spot , learnt a lot about you , ur views ur favourite football club and your school life .  People might mistake you as an introvert but buoy you speak you speak way too much :D . Because this guy has read so much , seen so many movies , documentaries , tv srs  and stuff is enormously informed and has immense insight in any topic . And its just not the information its his insight and his deductions that interests me , brilliant you are man . We din talk much in the 1st year i guess , but since then it was amazing to have you as a friend , can be an asshole at times  but wth!! everybody is :D . An amazing story teller , whatever he speaks makes perfect sense , your ghost stories are shit scary be :P . And ya how can I forget , this guy has a great ear for music , a big fan of Bob Dylan , S n G and some more . Encyclopedia of music , we did try out a few ourselves . I have cracked innumerous sardar jokes on him , but i know he enjoys them too . BIG supporter of Liverpool , can waste the entire net quota to see the match in his room in HD , great coder , good at almost everything possible !! We have discussed almost everything man , and you helped me a great deal in shaping up and broaden my views . Weve got 1 more year here , looking forward to learn a lot from you as always ( i can only try , coz u know too much ) . Cannot imagine my gtalk list without you bhalle !! All the best for everything . The herb in ps2 is on me for sure . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>
<p>You introduced me to movies,tv series,made me a hardcore football fan (although you support a loser team), encouraged me to study something else other than academics and even because of you i started abusing,i still remember the torturous harmonica you used to play during our ps1. In short, without any doubt ,the impact you had on my life is incomparable to anyone else i met in past 21 years, really i would like to thank you for that. I will never forget our long walks at 3 or 4 in the night, all the movies we watched together and all the counter strike games we had during our ps 1. In the end I wish you all the best for your future. hoping we will remain in touch. cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-khanna">Tarun Khanna</a></p>
<p>Bhalla the cool dude of AH3 . Got to meet him coz of Kushal who is his neighbour. The first thing I noticed was his ability to remain calm in all sorts of situations. I have rarely seen him shout at anyone or get unnecessary worried. Knowingly or unknowingly he gave me the tip which led be to become a very decent FIFA player - Play using defensive mentality. _/\_ Wo nahi bolta tho aaj tak I would have been a shitty player. Good in ACADs specially in those shitty AAOC courses. Good FIFA player and a really  helpful guy. Hope you stay in touch and keep smiling.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>Bhalla is one of the few guys in campus who has the superpower of mindlessly blabbering on anything he believes in like LFC, Computer Science etc. (belief nahi hota naa?? try having a walk with him at 4 AM in campus) and trying to change others' opinion on those topics but with no fruit. But dil se, ek accha banda... Come whatever may he always sticks to what he believes to be true. e.g. LFC, AAOC etc. :P... waise har baat ko exaggerate karna uska habit hain... 

e.g. He told me that he made a "supercomputer" in his PS1. ROFLMAO :D

But after unveiling the layers of his exaggerations, we find the he has a tremendous closet of knowledge to his possession. From technical things to sports to literature to everything, he always knows something about them all. The most silent person in the campus (except during those 4 AM walks), his birthday usually comes 10-11 times a year (if confused, ask that poor fella, or better, his bums). His early morning prayers of "Mundiya Tu Bach Ke Rahi" has been the sweetest alarm tone of us all in the corridor. A true night-outer, and a fake Blaugrana supporter during an el-Classico, his friendship has been a treasure. I won't say good luck and have a great career and all those stuff because those are only meant for goodbyes. And we will never say goodbye!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kushal-kr-das">Kushal Kr Das</a></p>
<p>Bhalla, thats what I call him, the dark knight of AH3. Many people still don't know what your actual name is. Japneesh is the most mysterious personality of all times. Never reacts to situations except on exam mornings when he running between rooms. We have had so many good times and given him so many b'day bumps. Going into his room is more difficult than entering the White House. We used to play badminton so often. That were the best times. He used to make me run like hell. He is really a very nice neighbor to have when he opens his room in while. I must say that you have a very eccentric taste for music. Also, a player of mouth-organ which is the first one I have seen in my life. Also, he is a pro at subjects in which I usually suck. So that's the advantage of having him near me. The most important thing, he is one big movie encyclopedia that I have ever seen. He has been seeing movies since birth (in any damn language including the punjabi dubbed movies). Respect /\. Just be this way and let us crack more jokes on you. Best of luck for your future. Keep in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
