<h1 class="page-title">Jaskaran Bir Singh</h1><p>Met him during my 1st sem registration after I got transferred from Hyderabad and the moment I saw him I know this guy is meant for something. A very kind-hearted, helpful, honest, passionate, calm, but lazy, he's def. a friend you would like to have in your life. Sometimes he's kind of annoying, in a good way of-course and to add to his charm, he has beautiful eyes ;) I must say he hasn't used his talent to a greater use but he can really go where one can only dream. I consider myself fortunate to have him around and I am sure he will achieve greater heights in years to come. All the very best "jassi" for the road ahead. :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>i smile whenever i think of him :D i mean itna mast kaise ho sakta hai koi? :P i still remember when i had to carry him to his room ( u can guess why! ;)) har COP meeting mein story suna kar bacha leta hai! first came to know him via Prabhat (we miss him), then became a PS1 and now a COP buddy! wish the association continues in IIM as well! :D :D
Jassi you rock!
P.S.: i hv missed almost all my CDC lectures in 3-2 (barring ACO)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>

Its all about the qualities Jassi has a good friend, best one in doing TP. The times spent together will always be memorable.

<p>Met this guy on his first day in the campus when he got a transfer from Hyd to Goa . He seemed to be one of the "asli punjabi" but it din take much time to realize that he was a proxy ..

We shared lots of things in common . Table Tennis was one of the kickstarts to the bond . Playing every night for about 4-5 hrs either in the common room or going to the IC ( it had a TT Table before ) was a rule . We also won SLAM TT that year , one of the best moments at campus . 

Love for barati dance , PJ's , situational humor , talking about life and future was a part of us . Zephyr 2011 , dance in the audi , that is the upper bound of all the public embarrassments i have gone through , still we enjoyed a lot . We wanted the crowd with us , eventually we got it :D . 

It was Spree 2011 , I saw him , Kabir and Mihir playing frisbee at the Lib Lawns . Literally stunned I just watched them from a distance for about 20 mins . Hesitatingly wen to them and rest is history . Love the game and the players . Jassi , one of the best players in campus always very challenging to play Ultimate with him . 

It has been a fun ride . These 3 yrs , 1 sem remaining . Hope to on some more bike and booze trips . I am always amazed how does he always remember roads and directions . I just keep walking with him without any doubt of missing directions . 

I may have missed a lot of fun things that we did but din type here . Hoping for your bright future

<p>Jaskaran Bir Singh is a friend, a dear friend, a true friend. He is one of those stupid guys who would put their friends before themselves for everything in life. For him friendship is everything and he never thinks about himself. He is a sweet, genuine, decent and an extremely down to earth guy. He is an easy going guy who can make friends easily. He plays good TT, cricket and now ultimate frisbee. An excellent photographer, I have seen his pictures and boy, they are more than just commendable.(my profile pic has been clicked by him). He is an enthusiastic DJ nite dancer and a great one too and I have shared some awesome moments with him on the dance floor. Zephyr 2k11 was probably the best. Organizing the hostel DJ with him was great fun. Asking Parshu for permission and wishing him happy bihu and baisakhi alternatively. He is the kind of guy who will cry and if the situation demands, will die for his friends. My only regret is that I haven't spent much time with him as I would've liked. He is one of my close friends and I am surely going to miss him. All the best for your future and have a great life ahead.

<p>Jask ! Where the hell have you been in the first two years man ! I must say we missed knowing each other a lot, Better late than never ! Got to know him in the fields of Frisbee ! We din really hit it off in the first sight but before i know it, in a very short span, we became so close that I would miss him even if he has gone out for a day. And on that note, a frequent visitor to panjim that he literally knows every  nook and corner of the city and his sense of direction is admirable ! Our first chat (as far as i can recall) at sem end night out at Curlies, its amazing how one can easily open up to him. Karan (how he likes to be called but sadly no one does :P) always keeps the air very lively around him, outspoken with a great sense of humor. And that little sarcastic laugh our yours is to be treasured man :D Dont ever give it up! A great sportsman, good in TT & Cricket ! Pro in Ultimate with \m/ long arch hucks ! Game isnt fun without you three (Mudit + God) and we for sure grew closer with each game ! Pro photographer ! A coffee maniac and thanks to it we have had some of the best Mongi walks and Echo points ! Thinks he has grown a belly (Well true actually :P) but dude no worries, next sem we are gonna hit the gym and we will put Ghazni Amir khan to shame :D. Had some of the best talks over Gtalk (major channel of communication despite being next door). Not a single hindi movie can escape his eyes even if its the worst ever made in the history of mankind :D! Yet another POOR soul fallen for roadies! And as gay as it might sound, you have beautiful eyes man! A very enthu DJ dancer (just being punjabi :D). If there is one thing that is more busy than the white house phone, it should be his mobile. Passionate about automobiles and as u have said,the Great Indian Bike Trip is definitely on the cards ! And he also turned out to be an \m/ testimonial writer (Deepak's status says it all). He has this great ability to establish good rapport with anyone and this is gonna take you a long way man. The ISB Clearance is just the tip of the ice berg and there is lot more to follow ! These were great times and I hope there is much more in future ! Cheers,<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anantaram-varatharajan">Anantaram Varatharajan</a></p>

<p>With due respect I beg to state that it has been a tremendous experience being your friend. :P
I hated it then but now I truly miss those days when you and Prabhat used to make play pranks on me for being Chinki, Naga, Saanp-khane-wala etc. etc. Those CP2 compre study nights which turned out to be Metallica, girls’-discussion and whatever else NIGHT on earth except studying.  Waise teri itni le chuke hain main aur Prabhat ki I don’t exactly remember any of those occasions. So I am not going to write any of those. Remember “second baar g**d phati” BTW? And also I won’t be writing about and thankful emo things which brings tears to eyes(!) Because anyways we are not going to die anytime soon and BITS is not the end of life and friendship. My worst four years in life were brightened up only because of friends like you, especially you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kushal-kr-das">Kushal Kr Das</a></p>
