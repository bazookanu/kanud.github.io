<h1 class="page-title">Jayant Dalmia</h1><p>JD!! This guy defies description- a very informed guy, a good student, a great sense of humour, an awesome musician and most of all, a great friend. My time in BITS has truly been better because I have known him and been his friend.

Have a great life and career. Keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>Jayant is an excellent driver. Given that he does not drink and is generally quite nicely groomed, this guy has a great future. I'm sure you will see him a few years down, being the driver of somebody famous. :D  Our shared appreciation for suits, general knowledge, music and George, Gary and Matt have made these three years truly memorable. All the best Jayyu and No! Ofcourse Not!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>Jayant- a person with immense music talent and developed taste. Although I did not get a chance to know him much, but what I know is, he is an amazing person, a great team player and one of the few guys who have a good sense of style and way.
Wish you all the best in your life :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Best neighbor one could ever have. His room has always been a common room for us. A complete food expert. He has the ability to play many musical instruments like drums, keyboard, flute, guitar. A very hardworking guy and has a knack of understanding things very fast. Always keeps himself well informed. Truly wonderful guy. Best of Luck for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Jayant is a terrible driver- one of typical Rich Delhi Boy types. A discerning connoisseur of good food, good clothes and good protein supplements and sources, he was the go-to guy when we wanted to have a good time. It’s too bad he doesn’t drink. He graciously opened his room for the public to chill out, dispose of their newspapers, have some chocolates and maybe even play some Bhajan Dog on his keyboard. Which he plays really well (the keyboard, not Bhajan Dog).He is a gifted flautist too. His flute recitals moved the hostel assistant to hail him as “Krishna Bhagwan”. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>You see, writing a lot of testimonials can drain one out of all his goodness. But I owe Jayant Dalmia a great one. And there is pretty damn good reason why. Jayant is not your average Maadu. Firstly, he is this highly cultured, sophisticated, nuanced, aware of the finer things in life sort of person. Secondly, when most of us live with an attitude of "chalta hai", it's great to know that there is someone who takes a stand on it and insists on getting things done in the right way. And all this stems from his unquenchable thirst for information which, believe me I say this from experience, makes him far more aware of the world than he lets on. He is a fine musician and has been a warm host to many jamming sessions. Our shared likes for suits and fine cuisine and our common woes in all JP courses have made our friendship truly memorable. And the fact that you withstood my singing in the absence of Suraj is the precise damned reason why you deserve so much more from me!
All the best for the future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>Jayu baba is an awesome guy to hang around with. He is well groomed and extremely polite people. He is a lovely keyboard player and is also damn good on the flute. He has fine tastes in everythng..be it dining or clothes. The only time he had appreciated me for the way i dressed was...well he hasn't yet.
I admire you for your knowledge and for being good at heart. You are one of the better persons I have known in campus. All the best for your future!! I hope you make it real big

<p>Jayu baby or Lufa boy, I will always remember Jayant as that guy who goes all red with the slightest of instigation, quite literally!!! With a very sophisticated sense in dining and clothing, he can be hailed as my nemesis. The agony aunt of the corridor, he is the one who taught me a lot of things. He does at times get frustrated though, by my success in beating him in some common trivial things we compete in like table tennis and split second. His musical sense is amazing. This pimpled maadu is quite literally a one man orchestra for our corridor (except the singing part - he is bad at it). Tripathi called him our very own "Krishna Bhagwan" when he used to polish his flauting skills...Will always remember how we used to barge into his room and molest his prized keyboard by playing bhajan dog. We still do it though, the barging thing, Chinmay and I, with comments  like "You first, sir!!!" and then "No No , you first" :P All in all, a very sensible guy with a gem of a character. All the very best. May you continue to \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
