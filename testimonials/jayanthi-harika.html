<p>SPORTSTAR is what I like to call Harry at times :P She is one of the most cheerful people on campus, laughing nearly 24x7 :) It was a pleasure working with her in Arts N Deco, I couldn't have even thought about STREET art without her & Sneha. She is one of those people who helped me calm down during dire situations and has made me smile a number of times :) Thanks for that harry, u rock! May your future be as awesome as you want it to be.

<p>harika is someone who truly enjoys life! go visit her when things aren't going right in your life and she will make you realise that life is not worth worrying about petty things-it has a much bigger meaning.. She is a very true spirited dancer...dances will full enthusiasm.... thanks harika you rocked our DJ nights! and one good thing is that she never thinks twice before pursuing her interests, like she got a new racquet to play tennis,she bought a new guitar for learning how to play,she bought paints,she learns skating...all dese remind us again n again that life is truly truly to be enjoyed by doing what u love doing... if some1 wants to follow it,take a page out of harry's book.Her  efforts tell that no skill is above us or too late to learn.. keep rocking! all d bestest..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>

<p>harryka..i don't remember how, where, and when i met you. But i still(and will) remember all those days i spent in your room, especially in the first year. You were always a great help, may it be in teasing ramya or in giving me food to eat( you get food parcels all the time,:'( ). 
Should say, the way you spell words..very funny( seriously :D). You are a great singer( i might want to take back the word "great") ), a good dancer(true!) and an awesome friend(very true!:)).  All the best for everything. Have a wonderful life!... kinda like the nick you gave me, though i pretend i don't:P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srija-reddy">Srija Reddy</a></p>
<p>Gorgeous, stunning, awesome, dazzling, great... one of ma best pals in bits goa. She is a person who is characterized by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. Her optimistic attitude  has always left me star struck. Her perspective of looking at things in life has always been an inspiration to me. She is an excellent dancer and a singer too. I love your smile Harry and i am gonna miss you badly. I wish you all the very best for your future endeavours.
