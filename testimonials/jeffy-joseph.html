<h1 class="page-title">Jeffy Joseph</h1><p>

Jeffy- girl with big eyes ,a wonderful smile and a pure heart.We became close friends during our PS-1.She is cheerful,fun-loving and hard-working.She was the who used to reach the office first everyday and just start working on her project no matter what ..Likes to gossip a lot.She would always find time to chat with her friends while in office and never tell us who she was chatting with..Never complains about anything.Funny thing is before every pic someone takes of her, she says "mere baal toh thik hai na?". :P
Remember how we celebrated your birthday with pastries coz we couldnt get you a cake :P...Our frequent trips to ice cream parlour, special  lunch every thursday, science city trip..We had so much fun :) Thank you for listening to all my silly talks n not getting bored by them :P. Be the same carefree and sweet girl forever..all the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ruchika--dalal">Ruchika  Dalal</a></p>
<p>Jeffy Joseph, you could say, is the kid in our group!! She can laugh at the smallest of jokes, her pretty smile is infectious, you can always see a sparkle in those beautiful eyes...as if she has done something mischievous and is trying to hide it. She is a beautiful dancer too ( will miss the dancing session during DJ Nite, Onam and also LT :P). She is one of the softest person I have ever met, soft both in touch ( ;P) and in speech ( She is very soft-spoken).I have never seen her hyper or eccentric...she is always calm and composed.  You will never realize how time flies by when you are with her, because she can be super fun too! I love the way she giggles at small things. It is  just so cute. And yeah...Jeffy...no matter how much you deny...yo really blush when we tease you with guys!! So Jeffy!!!Never ever change...I am curious to see what sort of a person you will you turn out to be, maybe 5 to 10 yrs down the line...and yeah...may your dream of marrying a chef...who can cook all sorts of food for you...come true!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/fatima-dilruba">Fatima Dilruba</a></p>
<p>"Waaat rubbish!","this girlllll","stupid girllll","huh".. The only phrases she utters when we meet :P... We met only during exams to do the so-called 

"combined studies" and ":D :D" is all we did :P :P... She is usually very cool.. or she thinks so :P... I knew her from the very first semester when 

we were workshop partners... It was only in 3-1 that I properly got to know her, thanx to the useless Numal lectures which opened the gates to 

our friendship.. She is very smart,intelligent, hard-working, a bit lazy :P,but is very determined and focussed once she sets an eye on something( 

GAN topper and almost topped ACO _/\_)...She loves coding.. CN assignments wouldn't have been fun without you. She is very patient, had to 

listen to all my stupid stories,watch all my favourite videos :P which she surprisingly enjoyed :D.. She is an amazing dancer.. I'm a great fan of 

her Bharatanatyam dance.. Went for all the Onam culturals only to see her :D.. And yeah, a die-hard non-veg lover.. Keeps describing all the non-

veg dishes which she loves and which interest me the least :D..The times we spent "studying" or should i say "laughing" are definitely life-long 

memories! I am not gonna say "I'll miss you" coz I know your immediate reply would be-" I know man.. I am just so amazing.. people will miss me" 

:P.. All the best.. Do stay in touch if u dont wanna miss your quacky and my ****** :D.. Signing off - Dobby :D	 P.S:You'll be the prince and 

I'll be the princess.. Its a love story baby just say "yes"...."Shut uuuuuuup" :D :D :D
