<p>Jinal is a guy who just enjoys the "pleasures of life". His growing belly is a testimonial to that. Probably that's what I like most about him. He's like that Laughing Buddha guy. He's lively, frank and often unintentionally comical. We've had a lot of fun working together on lots of projects, though most of that time was spent in nagging the other person to work. Ab toh Michigan mein phod ke aana. Phir agle sem ek aur treat le loonga. Par iss baar Hyatt mein.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>The first time i met him, he struck me as a class A nerd(which he is). But as i got to know him, other aspects of his personality came up, his ultimate tharkiness, his innocence and ofcourse that innate "gujjuness". He can turn any situation into a laugh riot by just the way he speaks about it. Ab toh bas michigan mein admission hona baaki reh gaya hai :D
Aur saale treat kab dega!!!???  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ahut-gupta">Ahut Gupta</a></p>

<p>Jinal or Jinu as people know him in hostel,an awesome person to hang out with.An always high on life neighbour with the most genuine smile I have ever met..A very intelligent,dedicated person who testifies his intellectual aptitude by getting top-notch grades,head of RoBOTiCS club and now he is all set to mark his presence  on American land…congos :) A genius in every sense of the word ,pile of certificates in his room scream aloud his success stories.I have always counted on him in my time of need(during compres and assignments) man..you saved me from getting a lot of C’s. :D I’ll always remember the time we spent together studying ES1 and ES2 whole night and phodofying the exam other day.Thank you for bringing all the gujju delicacies after holidays and being an awesome audience of my stories..And yeah I do envy you for getting a better room compared to the furnace of mine.Apt lyrics come  to my mind for our friendship,”Ye dosti hum nahi todenge,todenge dum magar tera saath naa chhodenge”..Cheers to “Jinu and Tripu” :P All the very best in life,hope that we do cross our paths en route in future. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhishek-tripathi">abhishek tripathi</a></p>
<p>Jinal Shah aka apna Gujju bhai ………… I came to know him through Milind and Rahul and since then, he has been a good friend.

<p>Jinal is a foodie, Jinal is hilarious, Jinal is humble and Jinal is a genius. The EEE wonder boy has already caught hold of an amazing internship at none other than the university of Michigan, Ann harbor and I tell you this is just the beginning. Jinal's got the enthusiasm, focus and intellect that is gonna take him places. One of my funniest friends, he cracks me up with his numerous anecdotes just by the way he describes them. Though a die hard gujju, Jinal's actually very generous when it comes to giving treats( birthday treat not done yet :P). Wishing him all the best in his every endeavor. Hoping our paths meet again in future!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Well this is going to be a long one.First time when I saw him was was during id-card photoshoot.He was the only guy in a suit and a tie (sign of a true professional :P) Well still I did'nt meet him actually.The second encounter was during time table registartion.His pr.no. was around 500's ,mine was in 490's and we ended up in being in almost same classes.But it was in hostel when I first met him.And from then on we have been very good friends.Jinal is a very caring,loving and joy spreading person.He is a blessed child.He carries positive energy wherever he goes about.He is very innocent and good at heart.He always carries a smile on his face and it is his funny nature which has made up my mood many times.Jinal has a nice tummy.All credit goes to C mess sweets.I will always remember how you used to take sweets 4-5 times during the mess.This guy knows awesome juggad.He has brilliant problem solving skills.Well by that I mean academic as well as practical.He can get any work done.He can negotiate with anyone.Jinal is also a very sensitive and emotional person.He cares a lot for his parents and he is his mommy's rather grandmommy's child :P .I remember when he used to say that her Mom would cry if she sees that he is eating such pathetic  chappatis(he does'nt like theouter part of a chappati) in mess.Sometimes I feel God has sent a messenger in form of Jinal.Infact our full names have maximum correlation between them.He is a pro in robotics and electronics and a quick learner.He always aims for simple solutions to complex problems.Has really nice time with you during Go-karting and those beach trips and Labs too.Will remember those days we had in MT-2,Deco and Analog Labs.Without you(and Aman) labs would have been so boring.Jinal is also a movies,WWE and himym freak.He loves John Cena(And also Anushka Sharma :P).And he likes to view hindi music videos and immitates the steps awesomely :P. He has been member erc(cordi),dep,gurjari(:P) ,eee assoc and what not.  True _/\_ .He like to enact dramas and dialogues.It is because of him that I am updated of films and stuff on DC.He has been a source of happiness in my life.What I don't like is those wrinkles on your head when you are all tensed.You then look really sad-like laughing buddha complement :P.So please never get tensed in any situation.May you spread happiness wherever you go.Best Wishes for your thesis at Michigan.May you succeed with flying colours.:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shabbar-a--vejlani">Shabbar A  Vejlani</a></p>
<p>A true gujju, he has been my friend since 2nd year. He has a prolific academic record and is one of the most famous EEE guy of our hostel. We had some truly awesome moments during PS1 and the discussions during the night were simply legendary. I still remember the way we ( including krupal) mimicked our PS instructor and the weekend trips between surat and ahmdbd ( including the bunking) were great. Haal filial toh banda Michigan jaane ki tayyari mein hai for his PS2 ( just like all othe gujjus ab ye banda bhi pardesi ho gaya :D ). I wish him a great and successful career ahead and of course US jaake bhool mat jaiyo…….<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>

<p>Jinal is one of the first people whom i met when i came here in first year. Since then i have seen him do good in everything he has put his hands in. One of the most versatile people around in campus. He is very serious and goal oriented when it is about his future. He comes up as a quite friendly and sentimental kind of person, but with a tinge of practicality attached to it. Wish him luck for future endeavors of life. Hope to stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunwar-kanishk-singh">Kunwar Kanishk Singh</a></p>
