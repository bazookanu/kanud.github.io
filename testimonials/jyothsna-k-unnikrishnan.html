<p>Jyothsana, do you remember our walk around campus once? It was the end of 2-1, I guess. It was wonderful chatting with you! All your childhood stories and the amazing place you come from! You told me about your late night stargazing with your father and about your school friends and how you used to play all the time and that you played all the games and were good at it. All the fun you and your gang have! Singing, dancing and fighting away in the corridor! You are a wonderful person and it was great to know you. Go on living wonderfully! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/surbhi-khetrapal">Surbhi Khetrapal</a></p>
