<h1 class="page-title">JYOTHULA VENKATA SUBBARAO</h1><p>Subbu subbarao,pawankalyan fan and he is also my fan... :)..He is great man to spend time but at the same time has some short temper which makes him look like an arrogant or stupid...But he is not..He is really a great guy and hyperactive too ...Have a nice life ra...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
<p>What a guy he is! Sure we didn't get off to a great start but I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with him. Having saved Waves with his awesome skills as the DOFAM finance coordi, he managed to make it all happen. Hope you have a great future, keep smiling :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Subba, my best buddy in DOFAM. Having first met him whilst working at the food court stalls as firsties during the epic WAVES 2009, our friendship has only gotten stronger. He is undoubtedly the best Finance Coordinator I have seen as of yet all throughout my stay at BITS and having saved WAVES 2011 from a seemingly hopeless state to a resounding financial success only adds testimony to his excellent managerial skills. I will never forget the times we have spent together most notably whilst working day and night as food stall coordinators for WAVES 2010 and drinking Cloud9 all day(The WAVES when we both drank on water :P). He is remarkably simple and one of the most level-headed guys I have seen. He is a role model for all future coordinators of the dept. and has excellent work extracting skills. His attempts at Hindi are as hilariously disastrous as his horrendously pathetic attempts to get new "cool" looks. He is one nice guy to have around as he will always crack jokes and try to make you laugh. He has big plans for his future most notably that of joining the army and some even more ambitious ones which he made me swear I wouldn't disclose to anyone :P . Overall he is a very understanding person, someone with whom I have been able to share things that I haven't ever with others. I trust him to achieve great heights in future and may we remain friends forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Hard worker, Honest, Fun loving, Trustworthy that's Subbu for me. Although dumb, he is cool looking maniac. Does all the embarrassing things and still mingles easily :P. Jokes apart, he is cool dude of kakinada :D . A great lover!! . He always has a solution for the situation ( it may be taking li8..sometimes :P). Also he loves what he does. What i hate most about him is he always has a clear plan and he wakes up daily at 6 and attends all classes :x. 
And i know we ll be in contact in all coming years so i dont need to sign off.
Keep going in the same same way no matter what ppl say , wish you all the success in future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-gupta-akirala">Tarun Gupta Akirala</a></p>
<p>Subbuuuuu, 
Subbuu and waves these two words that might not sync is what i felt in the beginning :)
But Working with him is just too awesome, The way you see opportunities in each and every single thing is one talent you should never let go seriously :). 
Getting a festival running with such low funds,and making RECORD breaking revenues to make this WAVES better than any so far is not an easy job. He always had the confidence that he will make ends meet when we were all out of hopes.
And in the end succeeded. KUDOS to you for that. Impossible is nothing is the lesson i will carry forward from my experiences with you.
Had known you well from my 2nd year,a very Good friend with a selfless heart. Sorry for the petty fights we had :), 
Fearless to speak out your point,breaking conventions,staying optimistic and working for that vision you have. Don't ever Loose these awesome qualities that you have, And couldn't have asked for a better Waves Cordi than you :). 
Thanks to everything. All the best for your future :) . And do stay in Touch. Cheers :)

<p>Subbu......a great fan of Pawan Kalyan. A great guy to be with though he is a pain in da ass at times. Dedicated to his work, he sets an example for others and he doesn't let anything let him down. He is a determined soul with a great will power to achieve anything he sets his foot into ( apart from studies....:P). He is very friendly to everyone ( check his FB profile..:D ) and always has a solution to any problem at hand ( though we face many other problems if we turn to his solution.....:P). He is very helpful in nature and good at heart. There is more to say but I may count my days if i reveal them....:)...Wish u luck buddy and enjoy life to the fullest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/j-harish">J Harish</a></p>
