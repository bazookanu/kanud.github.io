<p>SHARKK!!! my ps mate,hostel mate and one of my very good friends.One of the most talented students in the campus !!! when ever i  think of him the first word that flashes through your mind is ..The Real Pro!!! Though many of a time we call him Pro ,UltraPro for fun but surely he is !! One of the very fine Dota palyers  in the campus but known only to few who actually have seen him play !! His skill in designing and video making are undoubtedly the best !! It has been an awsum experince with him as a friend , PS mate and SPREE !!! The only reason  for spree teaser video to recieve such a splendid response is his sole hardwork and skill !! One very good quality i see in him is even though he is very good in many aspects except studies :P :D he never give up learning ;he always try to learn something more !! I m proud to say that i m the president of his fans association :P :D indeed he is the star of ah-3:P!! Protrax,gymson,shark-the ultra pro and by many more nicks by which we generally call him :P it has always been real fun calling you with those nicks and commenting you of your Proness :D !! I seriously miss your tips in Dota :( (fixxuu :D)!! I wish i could become shark 1 day :P !! I wish you will attain the heights you really deserve in your life !! All the best for your bright future !! -KK <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krishnakanth-reddy-chennalla">Krishnakanth Reddy Chennalla</a></p>
