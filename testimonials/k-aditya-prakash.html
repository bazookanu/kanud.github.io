<p>kappa....is one of those rare persons I have ever met who very readily accept their mistakes and learn from it. Whether it be the cake fights or fight for marks he tries new strategies every time and takes away what he wants  ..:P. He is a very simple person who can easily be moulded into anything you want. That is the reason I am sure that he will attain success because he brings the change in himself when it is needed.
He is very hard working. Despite so many hardships, he stays patient and calm and this will make him a very responsible person one day. We have many corridor fights, birthday quarrels and epic kappa and pawan's dialogue exchange as life time memories.
Hope u get success in whatever you wish for.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>

He talks a  lot and is always exited and full of enthusiasm (which i think is the cause of his success :P). A very hard working guy, and attend all the classes even if there is some exam just after the class( eg online exam which is the most unfortunate exam for me in my bits life:(     ), he will attend the classes, very very sincere in class and make all the notes. and also helps others.....Sure, he will get into his dream company :)
