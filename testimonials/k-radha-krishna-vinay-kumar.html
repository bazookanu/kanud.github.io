<h1 class="page-title">K Radha Krishna Vinay Kumar</h1><p>He is the real god of our batch..the ultimate working machine for any club or department he works for...I havent seen a guy with such a patience and enthu to work for any thing...He is great to spend time but the only problem is his typical guntur jokes which bores us all,ya but out of his boring joke comes a new good joke on him....We all love him but it seems girls love him more and he spends more time with them...Just kidding ...Have a nice life...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
<p>KRK Vinay Kumar Aka Devudu the name says it all... this is how he got this name... right from the first year he used to take part in various campus activities... let it be ganesh chaturthi, DOSAR, Arts n Deco, Ugadi, and many more... he also is the chief co-di for DOSAR, co-di for Ganesh Chaturthi, given a chance he would have been the co-di's of the other two also... but it was then he realized of his prime importance in the campus,studies, due to which he had limited himself to the two posts... given ne sort of work the first person whom seniors used to rely upon in jrs is vinay thats the amount of dedication he puts in all these activities... i bet people.. given a work and neone can stand onli 2nd to him in the dedication and hard work he puts in... and also good managing skills in him will ultimately brings out the best out of the work... This is the story behind the name devudu _/\_

 Apart from all these usual stuff which everyone in campus knows about him... vinay to me is very close and a best friend... he is a true and promising friend one can ever get... i couldnt share every single thing with him bcoz we are from different hostels... but shared all the important things and he has always been the support that i needed... though we are from different hostels... yet he is the one of my close friends in campus... that is how important are departments in bitsians life... without dosar i would have surely missed a friend like him... i know vinay just by face till my frst quark... our journey together started then in the department work... and there is no turning back again :D... he used to drag me to the ganesh chaturthi and ugadi work too... i used to hate him at times... when he used to drag me for those activities... and even i used to skip most of the times...  i am one lazy ass who is comfortable to sit in the room, the first answer i would give to anyone who asks for something is NO... This reply would have hurt u so many times and i am very much sorry for that :( though we had many memories in common.. the best memories came out to be in our 3rd year... UGADI-2012 and the team we are part of, will be remembered forever in my life... finally Vinay i wish you all the success in life and all the best for ur future... we have one more sem with us.. but now there is no department work or fest to work together... and me mostly moving to ch1 would onli increase the distance between you... unlike these years where i used to skip coming to ah5... i would love to spend the remaining time with you and and have more fun and also gather more memories that will be remembered for a life time... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dammalapati-rakesh">Dammalapati Rakesh</a></p>
<p>Great Guy. Good leader. Insanely humble. I admire his qualities and will always cherish the days of Zephyr, when we toiled to complete work with just a workforce of 5 people. But nonetheless it was awesome fun. An awesome person who will shine wherever he goes! All the best and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>

<p>Vinay!! My room mate in PS and he'd kill me for saying this but i don't know his name till then but he knew mine so as I always used to say "he's not popular :P". We have shared many experiences, stories, laughs, secrets and opinions during our PS. I seriously don't know how I'd spend my PS without you. I should his love for his phone...the whole day he would be sleeping in the bed and at night he used to walk around the hotel for more than 3 to 4 hours talking to his "friend" just like a nocturnal animal. We always used to fight over the AC temperature, I wanted it lower and he wanted it higher. He is really a great guy and a true friend and i'll always remember the days we spent during our PS. A very popular guy in campus(but i disagree) and also very kind and soft hearted . I will always consider you as one of my close friends (i have to coz u know all my secrets :P). His leadership skills will help him soar in life but still I wish him a very successful career. All the best!! Cheers!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>Radha Krishna Vinay Kumar.....hmmm....name alone is that big but the person is so tiny  :P
(not at heart though :) ) Oh God...!!! He can just make anyone smile at any point of time with his smart (lamest and dumbest  :P)  jokes.... He is a kid but a talented one (Guntur ka hain na ;) )....One more n probably the last talent  ( :P ) is he (thinks) is good at organizing....tries to but freaks out a bit in the end though.....after everything falls in place the happiness in his face is just awesome...makes u forget all your  tensions and you also start enjoying with him... :D
Vinayyyy......Devuduuu... u just \m/ ;)
All the best..!! keep rocking..!! :) :)
