<h1 class="page-title">K Sneha Chandra</h1><p>Sneha!!! My dear neighbour!! From being the noisy neighbour in 1-1 (:P) to one of my very good friends now, we have come a long way. She is one happy-go-lucky girl who always has a smile on her face and a spring in her step. After every exam she makes a resolution to attend all classes but due to her “lite” nature hardly keeps it up for more than a few days. She is very dedicated to her work in Arts n Deco and DORA. She lives life to the fullest and enjoys every moment. Her enthusiasm is infectious and always succeeds in brightening me up. My partner in EPS I won’t forget the times we spent in your room making up random stories :D I am sure you will do great in whatever you do as long as it really interests you! All the best my dear!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>

<p>Sweetheart! That is the perfect way to describe Sneha. I have never met anyone like her in my entire life, her unique nature really inspires me to be a better person. I am always going to remember the good times we had in Arts & Deco, and the way she would light up the room she would walk into while work was going on. Her smile and her capability to make a lot of friends are things worth admiring. Her style is epic and I hope she stays the same forever because her style is impeccable. Enjoy and keep rocking :) And ya do stay in touch :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>

<p>Akka!!!Chelli.. Aww.. I am gonna miss this! She is one great company in whose presence I cannot stop laughing!. She is very charming which attracts everyone towards her room :P :D. I remember the days when your room was like a common room for the people of our corridor and others. The countless number of times our beloved Niru would gets furious looking at the number of footwear outside your room!... She is very dynamic- was an active member of DORAH and DR10D right from 1st year. She has a creative mind and a great sense of humour and is excellent at motivating people! I always enjoyed her company! The priceless expression on her face when you would come to my room and listen to my playlist playing or watching "the movie" shall be remembered for years to come! :D :-*. She is a great friend whom none would afford to lose.  Will definitely miss walking into her room before entering mine after classes! Keep rocking\m/! Love you loads. I'm sure we would stay in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>

<p>LIFE:god i hav observed many people and gained much knowledge but i hav got much to ask u ............ why is that u never make any thing perfect ..........why is that u always make something with  some defect or the other...........why is  it so..........
GOD:hmm...... now let my answer start from you are you perfect? nd if not tell me your defects..
LIFE:im thankfull for all your kindness to me truly speaking i hav no defects but my questionis is about others....!!!!!
GOD:that's where the truth lies when you see  every one as you see yourself  ..........then u get what is right nd wrong then u hurt no one which gets u near to perfect ...nd people love you as every one likes  sneha......
LIFE:hmmmmmm......... a clever answer ....:P   ok my next question is tell me the thing's that are sweet,hard ,easy to get but most expencive,sensitive,cute,best,and last the luckiest 
 GOD:the sweetest thing is sneha's smile ,the hardest thing is her determination,most expencive nd easy to get is her smile she shares her smile to every one she meet,the fragile one is her heart, the sensitive one is other's heart  whoever she looks at their heart melts...,the cute one is her face when she is angry,best is the time that one spends in her company,the luckiest is U(..........:P) to be in the same campus with her..............:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>

What is it going to be? What are we going to do?...remembering all of it now, couldn’t stop laughing… :D :D Our singing classes “give me some sunshine… :P :D”, should have recorded that :D Our Dj’s, celebrations after xams, tennis court, playing ‘in and out’, movie with kurkure, coke, lights off… \m/ Sometimes I simply keep coming to ur room for no reason, just the presence of u makes me feel better… :) May be you have a magic…!!

<p>Sneha..!!!! My bestest friend..!!!jus dunno hw 2 strt...!!!Random thoughts crossing my mind..!!!Life in bits without u is unimagineable..(next sem :-( )
My bits life is incomplete without you..Those crazy things,morningg and nyt walks,horror movies,ur crushes,continuous eating sessions in ice nspice,teasing geeth n mummu,driving ppl mad wid our divinity concept,scolding vinay and last but not the least "Walk to vasco" --craziest thing we have ever done ,made my bits life cherishable.
She is so sensitive,caring,stubborn(sometimes :P),hardworking(if she likes to),funloving,spontaneous,has a very gud sense of humour and is unstoppable if she decides to do anything.I learnt a lot from her in these 3 years..I learnt how to express(ofcourse not completely,but better than what I used to be before cuming to bits).Its completely because of her that I became a sensitive person(emotionally :P,otherwise used to be aperson who never cared about others feelings),stopped being rigid in judging some things..etc etc.And yes,we learnt many things together,abt ppl and all from our experiences..!!
Love you loads n miss u..!!!:-*<3 lets rock our last sem in bits and lets do more craziestt possiblee things..!!!! --ur loving n bestest frnd pranu<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranathi-reddy-mandadi">Pranathi Reddy Mandadi</a></p>
<p>Elizabeth, who is still searching for her “darsey” ... remember that talk we had :P... those days were so damn brilliant... with all those masti, talks, things we used to get from home.. everytime sitting in your room and knocking at your door (whenever I used to pass-by)...  Your fancies towards nail-paints.. Your secret crushes( which were never secret)... bring a smile to even your face... same pinch.. I remember the nerd-looking sneha, who has got an extreme make-over and looks  very sophisticated and pretty... She is one heck of a person.. she has an aura of her own.. very quiet, but very naughty.. very childish but yet very mature.. God must have taken so much of time to send you to earth.. remember how I desperately I wanted to learn telugu and one day, you consoled me telling about one of your friend, who learnt telugu and speaks so fluently.. I wish even I cud ve learnt telugu.. I just loved all your chemistry love.. Osmi, plati... nw understood what I meant.. Panda classes were bearable because of you.. very soft-spoken, humorous, dedicated towards studies... I have never seen her getting angry... those moments of joy, sorrow... thank you so much for being there... and ya Once we come back... stay in room-203, so that whenever I pass-by, I can sit and have a chat... love you.. :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
