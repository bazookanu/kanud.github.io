<p>Surya... apple of his sister’s, mom’s and all of his friend’s eyes.... A guy whose life is physics... t who is a typical geek, possess a great sense of humour, and is fun to be with... I still remember the day we met, the casual meeting which had grown strong today that people ask us about each other, My bestie.. who was with me during my hard times, be it physics or CP2 compre... Remember how much did I cry and the way you consoled.. you are really caring and protective for me... never let me be sad for even a while... I know we could not spend time together these days, but we are and will be very close in our own ways.... the long chats, texting at home, all your cute gifts, bring a glint to my eyes.. Be it the stupid stories of lime soda, chaat, crushes, shopping, pizza we had it all... The treat we were in madgaon and we came back to campus on foot from vasco...man i was so scared... :D.. that was another sort of adventure.. be it raakhi, buying gifts for shru or yash, we have done it... I have never seen a caring guy like you.. ever... Now lemme talk about you, a person who never gets bored when I speak (ob no one does.. :P), a genius and pro in physics... who studies never for marks... not an exaggeration to say that he is born for physics... he doesn’t like coding at all ( all those onlines and labs).... but hard-working to the core...who loves travelling and buys gifts for everyone he is close to... Addicted to Lime-Soda( which is not good for health)...BATMAN, DragonBallZ, All sort of cartoon, and loves home-food... loves teasing and pulling hair.. :P... Your work for Nirmaan is really commendable (ShikSha... and the speech you gave during 15th aug in school)... really inspirational... feel proud to have a you as my friend... Now, Words fail me at this point to describe our friendship ( which is surprising in itself) ... _/\_... tata... (won’t say be in touch.. because that we have to)... take care..All the best !!!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>SUrya Kiran...120Kilobytes!!!!Make it short SUKI....20KB!!!! Its written on our class room bench as "suki-rac" and "su-kirac"..surya the another fanatic of Physics and one of my close friend on campus.Ever since i know him, he was the guy who never studied for the sake of exams....he always went deep into the crux of the topic and would not leave it until unless he achieves it..that was what always made him special..His unparalleled imagination and intuition in physics is admirable.Personally suki, you were instrumental in helping me out in understanding physics!!! It always occured to me that whenever i had any doubts in physics u were the first person who came to my mind.Thanks a ton suki for your help.Im really indebt to you in this context. Coming to our good old memories.When we came to campus we had Andhra freshers meet with our bathc girls before seniors arranged for it.Then our 4th year seniors calling u to theri hostel!!!remember our first journey to home?We went to home as a result of jaundice out break on bus!!!!Then our hostel telugu trip to Mynapi waterfalls!!!!! and all that turmoil we went through when we were lost in the forest!!and vivek(ah-3) calling his mom and telling her that we were lost in the forest!!!..We finally thought that only army men could come and rescue us in helicopters..all these in 1st year...(we were pretty famous in first year after this).Im proud to be a AhH-4 guy...Hoping that your dream of having a ride in Lamborghini gets fulfilled....All the best for a wonderful future!!!!!! Keep smiling  :)  :). Miss u!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>My baby!!!!Suki and me have been best friends since our 1st year….He’s one awesome person to hangout…it never gets boring with his loonnngg talks about lime sodas, cartoons, batman, adventure trips…it’s real fun time for anyone around him…he always lightens up people’s spirit and tries to motivate everyone…basically a person with a kind heart.
Our journey to home during the jaundice holidays was the 1st time I got real chance to know this superb person…I still remember that journey…The best unplanned journey of my lyf…can never forget that :D :D…thanks to suki we made it to our home finally
Suki and me used to have really long talks about western ghats,his experiences in Managalore and yeah mostly about hot mangalore chicks :D ;) 
Suki and I are great followers of the vampire diaries….he was the one who asked me to watch many awesome tv series like DeathNote, Young justice, Vampire Diaries, X-Men(2011). Yeah!!Cartoons!!!Cartoons, Horror movies and vampires are the major things which me and suki has in common…..Suki is mad about cartoons…I still remember the day when he lost track of time watching a cartoon and went around 20 minutes late to the examination hall :D :D...This is gonna be a never ending testimonial if I start talking abt suki and his cartoons craze
Talk abt batman and surya is the 1st person that strikes me…In my mind I sometyms imagine suki in the batman costume (even though I never actually told him :P), though I doubt if he fits in tat :P :P ….with his obsessed talks about batman I think he has the capability to hypnotise anyone to like batman, and joker especially.
His testimonial cannot be completed without mentioning his physics “pro”ness, ofcourse how much ever I mention its’ still gonna be incomplete….just in a line: his passion and interest in physics, his intelligence has fetched him an internship in IISc, Bangalore…well that says everything… _/\__/\__/\_
Suki baby I’m never gonna forget the Mynapi and calangute trips, which we’ve gone together…it was always fun to go to anyplace with you…may it be Majorda(the back waters) or bogmalo(rocks) or vasco…it was never boring…I’ll surely miss those little adventures of ours. Love you!! <3 <3

<p>A god when it comes to physics..his concepts are crystal clear. Very hard working, attends all the classes and a BATMAN fan..He is very helpful and clears all the doubts patiently. Enjoyed a lot with him in 3rd year be it inside or outside the class. Pappu, me and Rupani completely relied on him for MMP assignments and without any fail he would give it. His room is a mini classroom with random "Quatum mechanics"(yuck..:D) equations written all over. I am damn sure that his attitude towards life(for him life is Physics) will take him to great heights..Wishing him atb..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>SU-KI your name reminds me of Sukhoi SU-MKI :P but then you both have striking similarities.. :D Best in what you do and that is physics. Your passion for physics and your willingness to learn is simply great. Your humble nature and friendly attitude just adds to it. Always willing to help. Always calm, composed and with a smile on your face. Knowing you has been a pleasure mate. All the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
