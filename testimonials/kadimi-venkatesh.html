<p>Venky I can never forget you as you are the one I always hung with in my 3rd year. Most jovial, most funny and also most short tempered at times. Chit chat during exams with you is always fun and memorable things. Most patient while studying and also cs addict. But you will do the things perfectly and you are very serious about your acads. I can never forget the times when you and suri study together. Hope you would achieve great heights..     <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
