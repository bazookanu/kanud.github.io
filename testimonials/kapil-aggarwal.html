<p>My rooomiiiieeeeee. Yes, bits doesn't gives us the opportunity to have roommates but PS1 surely does ;). One of the most decent guys on campus that i have ever known. Always fun and respectful and true to what he does. It was an awesome time spent in panipat and was probably the only reason that we started liking that place a bit. Cheers to you mate and all the best for your future and i know you are gonna rock it :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>Engrossed in his books, donning his ear-plugs... that’s him during exam time... if a guy who attends all classes sincerely and is ready to help everyone with his notes, It can be him... there are so many qualities that distinguishes him from everyone else in the crowd. He is serious and at the same time very sarcastic and honest... IS classes were many a time interesting because of his comments... very amiable, helping (to those who really need it) and that’s the best thing I like about him... His dedicated work towards Placement team is really admirable, really yaar, going to miss all those lectures, with you... you were a spark in the class... Take care and make sure to be in touch... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>Kapil (fondly called pilpil :P) is one of my jigri yaars :P Always very cheerful and jolly, he makes everyone around him happy.  With his kind heart, he would go to any length to help others. Very studious, he attends all the classes without fail :P. His dedication to Placement division is commendable. A fun guy to hand out with, he is very funny when he is high :P Its worth speaking to him then :) Had lots of fun with you (specially at the doodhsagar trip).  Will have lots of fun in PS (in Banglore). Do keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sonali-bhadra">Sonali Bhadra</a></p>
<p>The first thing that comes to my mind when i think of him is hard working. Chahe duniya idhar ki udhar kyu na ho jae, you will always find Kapil making his way to the insti building to attend classes :P his determination and sincerity is something which really inspires a person. He always has a positive attitude about life. And always cracks stupid jokes jiska logic bi khudd hi smjhata hai ki joke joke hi nahi rehta :P haha...anyways, all the times spent with you were awesome - aarakshan, bogmalo, netravali, banolim etc etc...there are so many of them :D All of us together had a really great time together and all these moments will be missed a lot! Wishing you all the very best in future and may you get whatever you wish for. Have an awesome life ahead !! :D:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Punjabi in every sense, one could easily guess this by his looks... I met him in my 1-1 sem where we competed with each other to achieve great heights in terms of acads.. That result marked the foundation stone of your friendship.. We might have faced lot of cyclones in our journey but with such a strong foundation our building of trust and friendship still stand tall.. My only supporter in PJs.. A person who cracks all those jokes just to lighten up the environment...  Immensely mature person, and a houseful of great advise. He is the one whom you can always approach if you need any medical help ( " n yes iske dad pure doc hai ").. He is the one with whom I've traveled the most, Be it that legendary trip to Mahabaleshwara, mumbai, pune and then to delhi or be it New year night outs.. My first night out was also with him where we discussed about different varieties of beards a tree can grow n hence had a close escape from the cops... Coming to your personality aspect I can just say that you really are the most hardworking guy I've ever seen.. If he takes up any responsibility he will do it, and do it effortlessly. After 1st year he has been so much focused studies that he has created new milestone in terms of effort a guy can put in to understand and compete with rest of people around and mind you he has been successful in doing so.. Lastly, best of luck for all your future endeavors, n haan next time itna formally mat puchio ghar pe aane k liye... Jab mann kare aa jaio... Best of luck buddy, u'll be deeply missed... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

<p>Kapil is one of the very few hardworking people i've seen on campus, his cheerful nature and jolly character makes him a great person. He is always regular in attending classes and is a source of inspiration for others to do the same :P. I had some great time with him during the numerous train journeys we have shared together and the talks we had sharing Bansal Classes memories :D. I wish you all the best for your future prospects!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Kapil- The text book definition for hardwork and discipline. Kapil's smile never fades and he never and I mean NEVER misses any classes. We have sat through almost all IS classes together and it has been some experience. Will miss these days spent and also the blaring punjabi music from your room :) Keep rocking and I am sure we will remain in touch..
All the very best for all your future endeavours !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anirudh-mohta">Anirudh Mohta</a></p>
<p>Hmm .. kapil ..!!! I have so much to disclose about you ..!! My first meeting wid him on campus was a scary one !! It was the day wen a freshers party was organised for us . As a sincere junior , I was getting ready for it with many thoughts running in my mind of wat wud be my fate after a few hrs .Suddenly , this "giant" walks into my room and asks in his typical heavy voice "IS mai haina .. chalna ni hai kya ..!! ?" . Looking at his physique , one cud not imagine him to be a fresher That line sent jitters throughout :P and then later he told me that he too was a freshie coz he too was equally worried and made plans to face the bad times together ..!! ;) Haha ..!!! Since then we have been the best of frnz . I think it was destiny that we had to be together in literally everything , our ids being 683 and 684 respectively. All the labs , assignments , classes , killing our time uselesslyetc etc ..!! Most fun we had in the EEEP labs where we had nothing to do but ended up having loads of wickedness :P ... He is very sincere and dedicated towards achieving his goal . A very hard working individual , who wants everything to be done in a well mannered way. The most important reason of our great bonding is the sheer similarity of our thoughts and approach towards life . Many-a- times we end up speaking the exact same words simultaneously..!! We have always been together in the tough times supporting each other , no matter wat happens ..!! I know , we will be great frnz in years to come atleast till you get married ;) . All the best for all your future endeavours :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
