<p>Chethana (my bestee in bits goa) is a funloving, simple, smart and intelligent girl. She is the first person who comes to my mind in case of any problem. Throughout these 3 years, she was always there to help me out. I still remember the first day of college in bits goa when i felt very alone, friendless, helpless and hopeless. I give her complete credit for helping me 'come out of my shell'. I always felt very free to share any matter with her , no matter how silly it was. Her smile is cadence to my ears.She allowed me to be me, but also encouraged me to let loose and open up to enjoy the virtues of life.I will always cherish our memories in mess when we used to crack silly jokes, pass stupid comments and have good time.She was always ready to clear all my doubts even before the exam without slightest irritation. I thank her from the bottom of my heart for being so warm and affectionate to me. I wish her all the very best for her future.
