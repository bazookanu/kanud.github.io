<h1 class="page-title">Kartik Chhapia</h1><p>It feel like yesterday when he first ordered pizzas from Dominos for our hostel in our 1st year. A sports enthusiast, he is great company at all times and an AOE pro. Will remember the games we played and typically that "monk-rush" game that we recently had. Wish him all the best for his future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Chhapia is one cool headed, multitalented guy, and makes for great company. I can't remember the number of times we've walked around in Vasco, eating Butter Pav at Sundha's, followed by a Paneer Tikka Burger and a Coffee shake at Temptations. Star cricketer, pro photographer, AoE champion (though he plays under the nick 'noob') and EEE phodu, Chhapia is in his element when he's taking Bappi's case :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
<p>Chhapia ! One of my best friends on campus. Pro Photographer, AoE player and fellow AAOC hater. We've been on innumerable Vasco and Bogmalo trips. Along with my parents, this is the guy who has financed my college life. I've lost track of the number of time he has bailed me out financially. Rare trait in a Gujju. Ex-Teetotaler. It's been awesome having you as a drinking buddy too ! Took li8 in the first 3 semesters but found his niche when EEE courses started. Really aced some of them. Extremely pure vegetarian. Loves going out as much as me. Is a treat to watch when drunk (Utorda Party. Ladies Man ! ). This guy has a lot of career choices being an engineer, manager or a photographer (Many photos of his have appeared in TOI ) . I'm really going to miss you in 4-1 and all those AoE all-nighters, trying new places to eat out and taking money from you ! -Fungii<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>
<p>Chhapia! Met him for the first time on the train on our way to Goa. My first impression of him was that of a slightly arrogant, pampered brat (the kind of ones you'd expect from Bombay Scottish :P).Have to say, I was totally wrong! He turned out to be quite the opposite. Cricket is his first love and he is an excellent cricketer himself. In underarm cricket if he happens to be in the opponent team, then you're pretty much fighting for a lost cause.Takes a keen interest in football and like me watches a few matches in the entire semester :P (we do watch all the highlights though!). Also a fellow Man Utd hater :D. Brilliant in acads and can ace any exam if he intends to. A really good photographer. His SLR has captured some of the most priceless moments! Loves to go out and has been to almost all places worth visiting in Goa. Has a real weakness for Sundha's and Naturals( Strawberry :D). And yes, how can I forget AoE?! Is one of the best players in the hostel (Castle age in 17 mins _/\_ ).All in all, a really amazing person and a great friend for the past 3 years :) Be as you are and stay in touch. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>
<p>Chhapia! First off, he's got one of the coolest surnames ever! :P I met chhapia only in my third year, but as the saying goes, better late than never and true to that I'm glad i did. I think we really hit if off in SLAM this year when Chhapia was the AH3 keeper! I will always be thankful to him for getting me that pillow from Vasco (albeit with a pink pillow cover :|) We've had some good times since we've met, be it Bogmalo nights(after chaman converted you from a teetotaler of-course), bhattez fail treat at Daily bread or chaat evenings at Vasco! Its been great fun man and I hope this is the beginning of a long, long friendship! Cheers! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Chhapia - faad batsman, awesome photographer, EEE vicitm and AoE pro(from what I have heard). Chappia is one of the best teachers I know. Taught Micro to me and Arka with great amount of patience( though we let him down in the end). The best gully cricket player that AH-4 has, he has always been very enthusiastic about having gully cricket competitions in the hostel. Ardent cricket fan, wannabe football player :P ( kick volley, futsal, footaball goalie et all). Very very soft spoken and always game for a trip to Bogmalo or Vasco. Has lately acquired a taste for the FINER things in life :P. It has been great knowing you. All the best for your future endeavors. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>We used to be really good friends initially but then he started studying and from then on things between us completely went hay wire [:P] But Yeah, we still do share the common hatred for AAOC. It's been three amazing years playing Aoe, discussing Bappi's Gossip life, discussing Fungii's dirty habits and what not. The guy with the amazing DSLR and even better photography skills has been a really Good Friend through these years. Wishing him all succeses in life and an even Better Castle Time =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>Chhapia, or as Marcus address him Chhhupia, is one of the most awesome people in my (extended) corridor. A fellow EEE victim, well partially, since he has knack of acing a lot of courses(including cdcs). Chapia is a brilliant cricketer and a budding goalkeeper, hes also one of the best AoE players in the hostel. His desire to win is matched by none, may it be in AoE, gully cricket or football, he always gives it his all and expects everyone else to do so too, unperturbed by any who discourage him. We share similar pasttimes, may it be watching movies like LOTR, or random guru bashing. We have had awesome times together. Remember, Bangalore is coming! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Chhapia is the first BITSIAN friend I made. I met him on the train, and subsequently became very good friends on campus. We used to hang around Swapnil for the first few weeks on campus, until he got tired of us taking his case all the time :P. I still remember coming to your room throughout the first sem for Iced Tea and nutella! Gully cricket pro, AoE pro, EEE pro, pro photographer - this guy is truly multi-talented. I really appreciate your efforts at teaching me micro, although the results were short of disastrous! We've had some great times together, and PS is going to be even better! Cheers man!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Yo Kartik! I think I’m the only one who calls him by his first name nowadays. Quite possibly, the most normal amongst my closest friends on campus and one who’s helpful company is a refreshing change from the retards that abound in EEE & ENI. He’s extremely chilled out, soft-spoken, level-headed, incredibly independent, a EEE-course rapist, an ace gully-cricket player and a gifted photographer. We share a common hatred for the AAOC and share a vision to become famous enough to go on national television for the sole purpose of giving BITS Goa’s Dept. of Mathematics the finger. He used to be a teetotaler with a vengeance. But then, Aman happened and now Paani’s the lone inhabitant of that dark territory called ‘sober’. However, that’s probably the only good thing Aman has done in college, apart from taming Cadence to be his bitch and benevolently teaching us all. It’s a treat to watch Kartik drunk. Speaking of teaching, Kartik’s one of the most patient teachers I’ve had – could never have gotten through EMEC and Micro assignments without his help. Apart from that he’s also got the most awesome house bang centre of Bombay (or east or west or whatever, Bombay’s huge) which Fungii & me just cannot get over. Cheers Chhapia! I’m glad you’ve got an ID number so close to mine – that way if CH1 room allotments go according to ID, we’ll be neighbours! And then, I can have non-stop entertainment as you take Bappi’s case.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Kartik is one of those friens without whom my life in BITS would have been utterly boring. Always ready to help out, a level-headed person who aces his acads and is an AOE pro as well. I still remember the days when we used to bet money on FIFA :P Lately, he has acquired a taste for better things in life :P and man, remember last sem where we went out continuously after t2 for like 15 days continuously. Study buddies as well till last sem. He loves photography and is quite good at it as well. It has been great having you around and I hope we hang out more often in 4-2 coz that didnt happen at all this sem. Wish you all the success and happiness in life buddy!!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>Chaps. .. I read cool headed somewhere above... LOL.. He is the angry young man of our corridor. And things make his  pretty angry easily. But yeah he cools down so fatafat which is a quality I admire. He is an awesome academician. This might not be reflected too much in his cgpa and his 1st year is to blame for that. He hasn't at all given the nerd in him a chance to evolve and trust me he has innumerable potential in being the best at whatever he studies. Now about cricket,his one and only one love (' tho for the lack of it on campus he has been recent;y flirting with the football bitch. To talk about his cricket and I m like mouth wide open. The terrific fielding, unique intelligent bowling and mind blowing batting. He should ideally never get out but then hell we want to bat too, so he sacrifices his wicket tho yeah only I can get him out :P .. He actually is my first friend on campus. I don't know if u remember but you were the one to extend that hand of friendship and the one which is now for eternity. He is actually humble ... I mean he studied in Bombay Scottish,. lives posh himself but no.. no signs of vain at all.. Outdoor master of sports that he is, he is the best AOE player I know. and out of my foolishness I have even vowed to beat him one day.  He has had a cold right from the day I knew him ,but i believe that our friendship never gets the cold ...  I am always there for you man <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
