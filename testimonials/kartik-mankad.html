title: Kartik Mankad

<h1 class="page-title">Kartik Mankad</h1><p>Mankad is a true geek. Never loses an opportunity to tinker with stuff, or learn something new. You can always trust him with an answer, if you're stuck in some project. Pretty much everyone in our hostel (or sometimes all the way from CH1) would run to him if they needed help. He still hasn't started his CDC's, and still knows more than all of us passouts. :P

We had some great times in our PS station, thanks to his biting sense of humor, with our PS instructor as the subject. :D And then there were the DC chudaap sessions (ragging noob admins), and the PSoC lecture sessions. You'll always find him playing some random Katy Perry video (:ugh:), while soldering some new circuit, and hundreds of gtalk chats going on at a time. Had some great times with you, man! (Waise abhi ek poora sem aur bhi hai)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>one of the first few guys i met in the campus. an odd personality! if his chindigiri might strike you with pure Gujju shades but his lack of culture and taste will make u question on his Gujju identity(Naagar, the purest race! ;D ) hes witty and funny and will surprise you with his sense of humor which appears crass to some but has always amused me (i have always loved odd stuff and he knows it! ) he probably holds the honor of consuming the maximum of my gtalk chat hours which often ended in discussing the weirdest stuff :D hes the Geek God (chu in my language! ) and is the man to be consulted for any technical expertise. we are also a confidante of few of our secrets :P If you observed any change in him during the first to the final year, i should get some credit and he knows that too :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>The one guy who knows what he is doing and where he is going with his life. Seriously, half the people graduating still don't see a clear picture of their future. Man, this guy was writing DC scripts for 4th year admins in his first year!!. Frankly, the most intelligent guy by engineering standards in our batch, he is a wealth of knowledge and the guy you wouldn't mind spending time with any time, any place. Jovial in his own unique way, he can mingle with anyone and win their hearts at first meet. Ferociously ambitious I can bet everything, this guy has a splendidly bright future waiting ahead. Have had wonderful times with you brother, and hope we remain good life-long friends .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Mankad is the GOD of GEEKS (who keeps such nerdy GTalk sm's & omg LabVIEW icon as dp). Electronics is his passion. He is one of the most knowledgeable person on campus & always ready to help people with their projects (even the professors come to him for help). Anytime you can find him sitting in front on his desktop with some video being played in background of PSoC Creator & thousands of tabs open in mozilla searching for some circuit solution. On the other hand, he is a jolly & an ever-smiling face and one of the DC main-chat Kings (har waqt dc pe kissi na kissi ki leni hai :P). He is full of humour & witty jokes (witty? umm..... okaayyy). No doubt he has a very bright future. Had a great time with him !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>The first friend on campus. A true geek. Many will not know what to do with their life but mankad has it all figured out. A gujju at heart, he's a great friend. He might come out bluntly at first but when you get to know him he is the nicest guy. Will always respect him for his determination, never stops trying. A really good friend. Good luck will sound absurd coz I know for a fact that he is goin to go a long way in life<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>This is probably going to be long... Kartik was one of my first friends on campus. Met him while he was setting up DC on someone's laptop. To someone who didn't know anything about internal IPs or LAN cables what he did seemed like magic. He was the first DC admin of our batch, the 'live score ticker' being one of his most famous scripts. While others were hearing the names of microcontrollers for the first time, Kartik already had 'opinions' about them. His computer and electronics know-how was so impressive, that it made a few of us question our commitment to be engineers :D
He chose well when he had a choice between CS and EEE as his dual degree, he has more practical knowledge in electronics than anyone in our batch. This combined with a ever helpful nature has rescued quite a few number of LOPs across many batches. Under his supervision, Cypress Club gained new heights. Heights which enabled him to bargain and win over a certain authority in the EEE department ;) 
I will cherish all the hours I spent chatting, coding, prototyping, etching PCBs, gossiping (to the extent which would put any girl to shame :D ), traveling with him..(Being a phenomenal multitasker,he did all these together most of the time). A good speaker with quick wit and humour (occasionally losing tact; ask his Chemistry professors :D ). He has strange takes on life and money. Is in love with America, Gujarat and cheese. An amazing personality, friend, guide. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
<p>The smart guy who sells psoc designs and has an immense capacity to study a hell lot of crap. CE labs would not have been this much fun had he not been around. Bhand's blue-eyed boy!! hope you have a gr8 tym ahead!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sourav-banerjee">Sourav Banerjee</a></p>
<p>mankad , my boy. i cannot imagine my college life without you. you have always been there, during the toughest times, during the most memorable times. you were the perfect friend i coulind ever imagine. the endless gossip we had, the late night studies trying to bell the anjan cat, the lab reports,viva, the messing we did on DC and ..practically everything.
I have no doubt u will reach ultimate heights .. and just go easy on the gals and marriage part :P:P..   
i wish u all the very best in ur future.. don't u even think of losing contact ...... have a rocking lyf \m/  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>Electonics is in his blood. You can not mention him without electronics as also can't mention him with his 'mahaan' theories on how to spend money :P
Geek, Gossiper, always tinkering with stuff, ferociously ambitious, know what to do and how to do it. And he probably knows more about electronics then any other person on campus. Won't go into technical side as it can fill up the entire page.
Though I found him to be a little reserved initially, but he has changed. 
And how could it all be complete also without the mention of his unrequited love :P
WIsh you all the best, though i think you don't require any luck. May u go and do what u want :)
PS: we'll go to that HCI conference sometime in future. wotsay?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>The Chemistry student's( and more often than not teacher's) go to guy - Kartik Mankad. I'll never forget his "Listen,..", in the CE lab! It is one of those epic moments that will remain ingrained in my memory forever! I will be eternally indebted to Mankad for the MuP assignment! He's a great guy, always smiling, very kind and most of all, brilliant! Here's wishing you a great, great future ahead! Cheers! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Kartik Mankad - the only man I know who can tell teachers that they are wrong and be thanked by the teachers for pointing it out. A great friend who helps everyone in CE labs and class, I hope he enjoys himself wherever fate takes him. Cheers.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/udit-dewan">Udit Dewan</a></p>
<p>Meanass! Kartik's been, for too long now, the only reason I ever passed lab courses. Thank you, Kartik. No, seriously. He's all witty and funny and honestly, the coolest geek I've ever known. He's got some crazy passion for like, electronic stuff that I just don't get, but when you need marketing and financing services for cool stuff you invent, let's see who you come to ;) I'll even write a story for product promotion's sake. "The boy who loved wires. And gadgets." Anyway, coming back to the point, he's a great guy who has, many a time, inspired me to work harder. With a sharp tongue, and relentless wit, he's got a dynamic personality that's sure to charm the world some day. 
=D
Go do your thing, Kartik!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayeesha-khanna">Ayeesha Khanna</a></p>
<p>Mankard, one of the few people in campus who knows what they are doing and what they want to do, really all the qualities he has now, points towards a great future ahead, I came to know him well only in our CDC year, before that i only know him as a person who terrorizes every teacher in EG lab and mostly D.K. Mohanty. I still remember how well he proves his point to others, wrong or right he just puts it forward with his sharp tongue always there to defend him. We had great times during our CE lab, be it doing shitty,illogical  work in lab or writing report at the last moment we always somehow managed it good and lastly our long talks and gossiping about teachers in nescafe was the only part of CE i liked the most. He is an electronics geek, i think i don't have to mention that since  everyone in campus knows about it. He is a person whom you can admine,  I do. cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-khanna">Tarun Khanna</a></p>
<p>though i hardly know him personally, mankad has been my electronics guide for these 3 years via gtalk. He is indeed an electronics god, with PSoC being his speciality. we first met on mainchat ( to be precise, we met on titan and not on ws coz he was banned on ws during those days of 2nd year :P ). and since then, he has been on my gtalk list and has helped me so much (even unmuted and unbanned me  :P).  i dont even remember the last time i talked to him in person. everything just happens on gtalk. most of the credits for my electronics knowledge go to him. itna sab knowledge ke baad bhi, blade is an 8pointer (O.o). a true geek!!  and one more hobby this guy has developed is to like statuses of ppl on facebook, no matter what they are about or as to who has posted it, this guy just cant live without the 'likes'. kuch bhi likh do, gaali de do, abuse karo, like toh karna hee hai. if this site had a like option, all testimonials would have been liked by this guy. well, that's all mankad.  wishing u best of luck.!!!    may u make PSoC better than GSoC..  :P  ( the last one was a MafiA dialogue ;)  )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>
<p>Mankad is the silent, hardworking guy that lives in my corridor. Very polite by nature I have never seen him get agressive or angry. He is a true brainiac and I remember going to him to ask doubts in our common subjects. I always see him sitting in that posture before his computer, eyes fixed on the screen and fingers running over the keyboard. That's so typical of him. He is a true genius when it comes to processors and other electronic equipment and I'm pretty sure that he will be the next big inventor. He totally has the potential for it. It's been really nice knowing him as a person and being his friend. All the very best for your future.  Cheers! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/hemant-bhatt">Hemant Bhatt</a></p>
<p>Mankad!! The geek, the DC addict, the electronics pro, the nerd, the tharki, this guy is everything. I can't count the number of times he helped me be it during exams or fixing problems i have had with my electronic stuff. He such a chatty person(not in real life though) that i can hear the "thak thak" of him typing on his stupid old keyboard(thank god he's got a new one now) even at 6 in the morning. He always has a note book in front of him and a chat window opened on his desktop and his pSOC stuff lying on his table. Even though he's a geek he is also fun to hang out with and it's more fun when he drinks :P. What I want to say is he the a good friend and he will always be ready to help you (after he finishes studying). With his skills and talent I'm sure he will be very successful in his life(already is..aur kitna chahiye). I have had some great memories with you during the 3 yrs that you have lived right in front of me and i'll always cherish them(or atleast most of them). All the best!!
