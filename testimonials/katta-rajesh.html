I remember the way you used to bang my door and how I got irritated by that..I will miss that babai..Your smile is so awesome. That costs even more than 100crores :) :D(guess you are smiling :)). I will never forget the rides, NCs, football matches we had (your defending is _/\_ :P ). You are always there for me and backed me up in every situation. I learnt so many things from you, lot of things..The way you deal the things is very nice..You are a very responsible person and your thoughts are so mature. I will never forget you and I think I am very lucky to have you as my friend. All the best..Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/santosh-ayyagari">Santosh Ayyagari</a></p>

<p>Ey Babai.I remember meeting him in my first sem in our common room.He used address everybody as Babai(Father's younger bro) in a friendly manner,this made him Babai to everyone.He is a bit reserved but once u get to know him there is a totally wild side to him.One of the hardcore fans of Ballayya and NTR.One of the harding working people i know.A bit uptight sometimes justifying his title as babai.Babai u have earned a warm place in everyone's heart.Im glad that we met here and want to continue to be in touch ,Best of Luck for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhinay-choday">Abhinay Choday</a></p>
<p>The first time i met him in our common room playing carroms, i thought he was an arrogant guy :P. the thought in my mind then was"fuck this guy" :D. As the time passed, we came to know each other and obviously, my opinion had changed. He is an angry young man with a little bit dedication and tries to work hard but likes to take li8. But,somehow manages to do whatever he wants to do,its the best quality in him. I would like to see his face expressions when he is angry, i would do anything for that :D. He is as cool as no one until he gets frustrated and angry. Better, never try getting him into angry mood. You will regret it :P. Your strength is your attitude and dedication, i wish you will keep it up in every situation of your life ahead. He is one of them whom i don't wanna miss for the rest of my life.I wish you all the best and success for you future. I will be back and lets rock 4-2 together :P.

<p>Katta Rajesh....mera msc maths ka mai baap. Wakes me up for all classes and tests, gives me all class notes and also scolds me when I don’t study :P. It’s been a real fun experience being ur friend , especially all those talks about football and ya also  playing fb wid u (_/\_ defending) . And speaking of football , a harcore Real fan (or shud I say Ronaldo :P).Advice: don’t sit near him when Real is losing :P. It was great knowing u Katta, and I hope we remain friends forever.

P.S. Messi is better :P

<p>Rajesh well known as ‘Babai’. A big football fan. Upset ho jata hai jab REAL harti hai, defends REAL, its like REAL is everything for him. Very helpful, sincere person. Enjoyed all those really good times spent in the hostel corridor. Its been a awesome experience knowing KATTA. His selflessness attitude and commitment to do stuff takes him ahead in future. Good luck and MECH mein dekh lunga tujh..:P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
