<h1 class="page-title">Kaushik Sukumar Shanbhag</h1><p>It is always difficult to describe simple things. In one word i can say Kaushik S.S is like coconut.  His first impression is not much friendly as it took me one semester to be friend with him. No one can beat him in the arguments. One good thing about him is his straight forward nature. He will tell you what he feels about you on the face. Sometimes it leads to bad consequences. Two bad thing about him- he can't adjust with everyone and he doesn't share his pain. Because he think he is Big boy..that is true he is the eldest in the class :)..He doesn't like if someone makes mistakes in English..(sorry if i have done any ;) ). If you are good to him he will be good to you till his last breath. He can always be counted on to listen and provide support when needed.  He is more practical than math theories, and understands emotions better than Shakespeare. His wonderful sense of humor and life experiences have given him the ability to handle every situation. If you don't like jokes then better to stay away. Whenever i m sad or frustrated he makes me forget everything and get a smile on my face. We are lucky to have him as a friend..God bless him..wishing him all the 
best for his future..

<p>Kaushik... You can love him or hate him but you can't ignore him. He has a Brobdingnagian presence among us, like "Yoda" in Star Wars, always blessing us with his legendary wisdom and offering enlightened leadership. He has only one principle in life, that he is his own master. No one can conquer him, except for sometimes when his anger outwits his wisdom. And it's well known (among friends and foes) that you wouldn't like to face the fury of Kaushik. But then he is one of the best persons to have company with. I have enjoyed countless outings, trips, parties with him and hope to do so in future also. He has helped me overcome my inner conflicts many a times. He always manages to carry himself forward, no matter how great the obstacle is. Truly blessed to have him as my friend. May he achieve even greater heights in future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bibhu-ashis-jena">Bibhu Ashis Jena</a></p>
