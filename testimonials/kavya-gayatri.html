<p>Kavya, always a UKG kid, she has the sweetest smile and the most innocent look (true! but how do you always manage that :P ) on her face. A fun loving person whose cheerfulness can keep the spirits of everyone around her high. Though we are different in a lot of ways, in the past three years ( and counting!) we have done so many things together. Nirmaan activities and discussions, trips and birthday celebrations, EEE CDCs, assignments and labs are just a few among them.  I will always cherish the moments that we spent in Vasco & Panjim trying to get orders for SHG products, moments spent planning GBM's, excomm meetings, events like Zari sports, JOGW, ACM, interactive sessions, trips, treats and the eventual race to the hostel gate at 12:30pm :P .
Be it the never ending Nirmaan discussions or the brainstorming sessions on the silliest things on earth, or the ones about roses and rainbows, you sure know how to make the moments unforgettable.
You were great EMEC lab partner too ( that was until I realized that my blackmail about "loose wires"  would eventually turn out against me, take care to switch the circuit off next time you decide to touch electrical wires :P , seriously!)
It was a pleasure getting to know you, initially as a fellow BITsian, then as a Nirmaanite.. and now I am proud to have you as my close friend :) . I am sure you'll have a bright future ahead. All the best Kavya :) 
And don't worry, I have no intentions of saying "good bye" anytime soon :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>

<p>Kathri/K3, kavya, PPP(Picchi potti pilla), Kid, UKG, Waste fellow, STRESS BUSTER :D.......etc etc etc. 
Trust me, i got no idea about what to write in a testimonial for u, we got to know through Nirmaan, ex-com, but, we started talking properly since 2-2 end/3-1. I dont remember how we started moving around together, to mess then walks etc. I guess it was coz of Rahul, kudos to him, in time, we grew up to be very close friends, the things i really like about u is u r CHILDISH, VEEERRRYYYY SWEET N CUTE, PURE HEARTED, innocentISH, LITE TAKING FELLOW LIKE ME :D, Guess i will stop, coz ur horns grow every time if some ever praises u :D. Thats exactly the reason u were getting the treatments all these days :P, else the properties i mentioned above will be hidden in the horns u grow.  :) 
The bindaas person fun loving person always available for a chat/walk resulting a fun spent time, in fact irritating u had become one of my fav hobbies, u really r a kid. I will never forget the time u were soo pissed off at me that u suddenly stopped talking and went away to ur room and cried :P and u urself admitting that u dint know y emotional burst happened without any PROPER valid reason is was an epic, it was a quiet shocking moment tough, but then, in two hours the things were all back to normal. :) Always by default, the person to get a cake all over her, a constant company to any of her birthday friend :D and then saying "every1 toys with me" with a kiddish innocent sad expression, veerryyy damn adorable and cute !! its not that every1 toys with u or likes makes a joke out of u, it was coz of ur basic childish nature and the fact that "u were EVERY1S FAVORITE, the most loved person of the group. So, obviously there will be such consequences. Tough, u know its not just that nature of u, "u know whom to give credits for those things to start/happen" :D :D     
I am sure u ll always remember the "vegetarian joke" :D, when i had dragged u accompany me to my NLD class :D ! That was epic ! U bunked a day to accompany me to panjim to get my passport done, just to give company, u r \m/ ! U giving a treat to compensate for not calling me to Rahul+Setty's cake cutting ! :D the number plate game we played wen we had been to vasco omg wat the heck with ur observation, before i even looked at a number plate, bham, u wuld hit me showing some double number on some faar away vehicle, i had to cheat almost every time(which u stink at) so that i appear decent enuf in the game :P ! and so oonn and so onn and so onn.......such moments are endless, i can go onn and oon with it. Farewell was also a time well spent, and u finally danced, :D u dont really stink at it ! :) and hey, the expressions collage ! :D ! Oh k....i started again, guess i ll stop here ! :P 
From pulling ur hair, removing ur hair band, playing with ur chubby cheeks, hitting/ irritating u, totally addicted to doing these things, we also become close friends and kept some SECRETS between us :P !
U are one person whom i will really miss a lottt in times to come. 
Always be happy, live to the fullest with no regrets and  keep smiling, u ll never know who ll all for ur dimples ;) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/k-surya-kiran">K Surya Kiran</a></p>

<p>Kavya!!!!!i dont think anyone will call you with your name..UKG is what i believe to be the apt name as is suits perfectly for ur "kid" nature. :P  :P.In our journey of nirmaan, i realised that this "kid" can actually do miracles with her tactics and logical human relationship knowledge. A very capable person who was responsible for sorting out most of the issues related to Zari!!!!!Your contribution to whole of nirmaan is seriousy admiring.Not getting freaked out during crisis and stress times is the trait i which attracted me the most. Always smile on her face used to give me a notion of "dude!!!why getting tensed??chill out and relax"..Kavya ur are simply awesome!!!!no more words to describe...All the very best for your future!!!! and keep smiling...its your intangible asset which no one and no situation can snatch it off from you,thats for sure.. :)  :) Dedicating all these smiles to you....  :)  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>Yo yo Kavya Gayathri! You are a true kid at heart! :D. You are one of your own kind! The HR of Nirmaan Goa! The way you managed such a big team is amazing. I did learn a lot and lot from you. Captivating smile you have got and you never forget to wear it :D The meetings, discussions, trips, treats will stay memorable! :) All the best dimpy! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chandrahas-muvvala">Chandrahas Muvvala</a></p>
<p>Kavya!!! I dont know where to start from... She is pure by heart.. active member of NIRMAAN .. very dedicated and sincere, loves the work that she does. She never fails to maintain the smile on her face. One big truth about Kavs is that she has not yet grown up. The way she scribbles things in her notebook, the way she talks, the way she smiles are a perfect evidences to prove the statement. When i first met her , she was eating an orange with the juice flowing all along her hands, down through her clothes and finally settling on the floor.. I couldnt control my laughter seeing her that day.. I always found her very innocent, always ready to help a person in need. I will miss you all my life. All the very best for your future endeavours.

<p>I just do not want to write this testimonial!!Kavs :-* Never imagined my day without her voice ringing in my ears when she calls me "chelliiiii". She is my closest friend on campus, so close that I miss her even if she goes to 

library :D. Seriously!.. It has become my habit to go to her room everyday that I suddenly feel very lonely when she ditches(:P) me for meals or goes to library during exams :D. Well its very easy to describe her 

personality. Nothing great as such :P - "KIDDO" :D is too mature a word for her :P,a bubbly one,filled with a lot of ideas and great enthusiasm.  Met her on the first day during room allotments when I had no clue that she 

would my closest buddy in the years to come! Later we worked on almost same paitings in Art and Deco and thats how I got to know her better and then began our encounters with Nirmaan in the 3rd year when I actually 

started to begin to like her company. Initially we both we had the same choice in everything :D. We love painting. I distinctly remember the Ganesh Chaturthi paintings in our second year for which we had done a 

nightout,missed all classes and meals the next day only to complete our paintings.Such dedicated people we were back then :D. The next common thing which we had("back then") was our almost common playlist , to which I 

still remain loyal :P. Thirdly, our common interests in social work. I will never forget all the discussions which we (only both of us) had regarding how we could contribute to our society.Thats how we developed a good 

"resonance"(frequency match :P. Dont threaten to kill me for this line :D) with each other.She was always with me whenever I needed her for sharing all my happy-happenings of the day or burdened her with my sad 

stories or irritated her with my logics :D. I always wanted to have a sibling to share all my feelings in life but I dont feel that anymore! All thanx to her great company. She is there to accompany me everywhere. She is 

creative(creative director of our "Buzzleaks" which eventually turned into "TV0" :D), very sincere and dedicated to whatever commits. Inspite being "tiniest-of-all"(thanx to shreyas and chandu ;-)), she has been one of 

the most efficient HRs of Nirmaan. It was very easy for her to handle a group of 100+ volunteers, which in general is not an easy task. We had our OB  course together and I remember everytime we would learn something 

new, she would try to analyze it and think of ways it could be of a help for the organization. I thoroughly enjoyed working with her and the rest of the nirmaan volunteers during JOGW and ACM. Oh yes! ACM reminds me 

of how delicate she is. She suddenly began to feel home-sick and it was very easy to get her out of it. Kiddo after all ;). B'day celebrations (especially when fellow Nirmaanites are involved)were a disaster for us :| 

especially for this poor kid :P when she would be everyone's target for cake face-packing :D. Birthday!!!.That reminds me of yet another thing. Her b'day gift :D :D :D. When I saw it, I was just speechless! She took time 

for me to present me with something which just captured my heart :P. I did not know how to react when I saw it. I just wanted to go and give her a hug. . She is the best person I have ever met who can easily connect to 

others and thats what probably is the reason for her huge friends list. Yet she treats me as one of her special friends and I am really glad to have her as one. The large number of outings which we had with our fellow 

nirmaanties and friends are memories for life! The post-dinner walks around the campus out of joblessness :D and you entering a loop :D are definitely not worth remembering :P. Your sudden urge to dress up in a half-

saree and that too at 2:00 AM in the mid-night \m/ :P.The memorable pic that night:-*. Dont you dare to remove it! :D.And yeah, the way u tease me :|, I am still waiting for an opportunity to take my revenge.The OB classes 

and assignments :D,SOP work would have been really boring without your company. I am running out of words to describe you now.I might even cry u know :P. Thats all for now. There would be no person who could 

replace you in my life. You are the person I will miss the most. I will murder you if you do not stay in touch and you know that :D. All the very best for your future :). Signing off from our togetherness- Chells!PS:Anjali 

Anjali Anjali!! Merise navvula puvvula jabili :D. Keep smiling :) and the let your dimples steal everyone's hearts :))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
<p>OMG !!! the above testimonials are pretty intimidating considering the length ... I think i know a bit about this girl ... For one thing we were both alike in many things ... We are both definitely a bit crazy ... We had some great times together ... she was always the one i would go to talk whenever i feel extremely stupid knowing that she would understand ... Of course  we did some stupid things together ... But no regrets had a laugh in the end & learnt (maybe) ... Dont worry kavya crazy minds like us are much needed for this boring world ;) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sathwik-tulasi">Sathwik tulasi</a></p>
