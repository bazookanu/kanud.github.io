<h1 class="page-title">KEDAR DESHMUKH</h1><p>Kedar's greatest quality is, perhaps, his ability to think simple. Complicated as life is in an engineering college, Kedar comes across as a refreshing break with his straightforward and light-hearted approach to life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>The most straight forward and frank guy I have ever met. Also the most creative head amongst us. Also the most conveniently jugaadoo banda. Street smart and really helpful and friendly. Apart from these, he is a really good sportsperson as well. Chilled guy to hang out with. Thnx for making Mech and BITS Goa an awesome experience for me :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>K D Bhaai! Now what can I say about him! A wonderful person, great friend, tackles life by the throat, and lives it to the fullest! Nothing need be said about the creativity of this DOCW co-ordinator. Exams have never been a bother to this jovial person-movies and documentaries before the exam, its the exam that should be troubled! I have enjoyed a movie with him before Thermo compre :-D Guruji!!! Lage raho! All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>I have known kedar right from my first class in this god forsaken place. He has saved my ass countless times in the 3 years that followed and god knows how I could have got through all those labs without him right next to me. A delightful guy to be around, he has a distinctive ability to understand and apply even the most difficult of concepts with ease ( and more importantly with absolutely no effort :P, not that he ever put any into it :D). A truly fabulous fellow to have as a friend. I wish you all the best for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishnu-prasad">Vishnu Prasad</a></p>
<p>This campus owes Kedar (literally).He was always involved in organizing some event and at the top of DOCW it looks like he earned a reputation for being very passionate and very reliable. Which he truly is. It is laudable he took so much pain to get things to work. Apart from all that he is the inventor of a new class of jokes, jokes that go beyond PJs and anti-jokes, and test the very foundations of the definition of “joke”. He also starred (somewhat anonymously) in one of the most epic roles in one of the most epic videos made in BITS.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>The DOCW cordi is surely one of the most creative minds on campus . He has got special ability to create productive elements from crap , you can see his table lamp .For those of you who do not know he is a physicist at heart and a mechanical engineer by choice .  His presence of mind and common sense application are what separates him from the rest.Thank you buddy for the spooky nights , for the hungry times ,for the poker chips , for the company back home and for being there when  it mattered .I wish him a great and successful future.

<p>humble, simple and a really practical person. Got to know him better during the second year of working for DoCW. have to say, the best coordinator i ever saw, honest. i always failed to understand how could one possibly be so patient and soft spoken. No, really! 
i still thank myself for vouching for him to be the DoCW coordi, made my Waves 2011 so special and memorable. 
wish you success and a bright future, hope we cross paths again! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>K.D. is the most hospitable guy of AH-3. His door is always open. A rascal with a penchant for getting into mischief, he still manages to do whatever he sets his mind to. I hope he continues to enjoy himself and manages more stellar functions like TEDx. Be well my friend.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/udit-dewan">Udit Dewan</a></p>
<p>The weirdest thing we have in common is that we both reach the exam hall at-least half an hour before the exam starts :P Kedar is one hell of an awesome person, witty, charming, smart and friendly. He know his way around stuff with his creative eye and skills, he did a good job as the DoCW coordi. We have had more than a few coco laughs :P and he is a fellow mechie too :) His company is great and I know for a fact that he will shine in any endeavor he undertakes! Enjoy & Keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>The most simple guy i have ever met in my life. You will never find anything complex in his life. A truly wonderful guy to work with (We have worked together for 3 yrs in DoCW). An awesome coordinator, he was able to keep the department together through the tough times. Extremely hardworking guy. Recently he has developed a knack in photography and keeps on trying new and wonderful things. Only guy in our group to give GATE (basically only one interested in engineering, rest all have given up hope and have chosen MBA as a much better prospect), we respect him! I wish him Good Luck so that he can reach great heights. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>KD is a complete chillax guy.....does what he loves to do and with passion. He is also very creative and very helpful. My P.S. would have been such a bore without him.....that is the best time I recall with him....those mafia games and targeting  'Eureka'(You know what i mean ;)) KD is someone who takes no tension whatsoever and is always calm and composed and excels in whatever he does. Wish u a very bright future bro!! keep rocking! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>

<p>Kedar is the very epitome of lite. HIs sheer carefree nature during tests is laudable (truly). He is also the perfect executioner of the "jugad" especially during our mech cdc vivas , where he has used it with flawless dexterity. Besides being a very creative person, he also an integral part of the grapewine (especially wrt clubs n departments). An awesome badminton player, I have enjoyed playing antichess and tt with him too. I recall we literally owned the tt table in our common room which otherwise would remain unused. Going to the examination room  half an hour early was another thing we did together. All the very best...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
