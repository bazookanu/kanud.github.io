<h1 class="page-title">Khayali Jain</h1><p>Cute, quirky and really, really smart! My unforgettable EEE classmate and wonderful friend, Khayali is intelligent and sweet, and its always so much fun talking to her. She voices the most out-of-box ideas, the strangest questions and doubts, and gets us all thinking about them too. So many CDC classes  have been fun because she was there, cracking jokes but also paying rapt attention. She loves wandering about the campus when the weather is great, and plays the kind of badminton that I like to play - fast and powerful :D I'm sorry we didnt get to play too many games, and I'm sorry you're leaving for PS next sem! I'm going to miss you soo much. Always stay in touch, and take care. Wish you all the best for the future, and I hope we meet again and again! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>We rarely meet people who are brave enough to follow their heart. Khayali is a person who is a person who does what she likes, not caring about  what others think of her. I really admire this quality of hers! Be it cutting her hair short (I was really surprised when I saw you at airport  :P ) or wandering around the campus, or reading a novel sitting on vgh lawns, bringing those delicate kites and beautiful from home, she has her own way to live and enjoy life . I love the way she has decorated her room. I will never forget our train journeys together, specially the one where we both were singing songs and people had to us up! Jolly, helpful, hardworking, dedicated and fun loving are few of the many qualities that Khayali has. She always has loads of stuff while coming back to campus ( really loads :P ) . I am sure you will very successful in future, my good wishes will always be there with you. Will miss you ! and I hope we will meet again sometime in future. It was great knowing you. Stay in touch! 
P.S : looking forward to our journey back home, we will have lots of fun! pakka se! ?

<p>Khyali!!! The most passionate and determined girl I have ever come across. Our adventures together began somewhere in second year. Together we worked in IEEE project, spent time doing designing work for ICETET conference, the big QUARK of 2011 (most unforgettable event in campus for me) where we literally ran from one event to make it to the next, soldering circuits, GAN & EEE CDC classes , filling PS2 form (checking out the stipends :P) and even crazy things like shorting the ballast of a tube light in her room (ended with her screaming when the power supply to her room was cut off :D). Sit next to her in a CDC classes, and she'll make it even more interesting for you, with her never ending doubts and new ideas. Once she is determined about something, nothing is going to stop her from doing it. She once sat overnight and soldered the same circuit board thrice during Quark. Her enthusiasm and energy are infectious. She is fun to be around with and you can see the sparkle in her eyes when she comes across something she is passionate about. Loves listening to songs and enjoys lonely walks in the campus, especially when the weather is good :). She clicks more mouse clicks than what is necessary on an average (:P). Khyali, I will cherish every single moment that I spent with you and I am looking forward to our next year together. If not during PS2, we still have 4-2 :D. All the best for your future Khyali. I am sure you'll get to do all the things that you are passionate about :). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
