<h1 class="page-title">Khushboo Matreja</h1><p>honestly, i dont remember wen we met but i remember that i liked u since then. U r one of the laziest,most senti, n most adorable ppl i knw. We hv had our ups n downs..but college wud have been very very lonely without u..the night outs(be it a test, or just vellapanti), ur embarrassing episodes ;) , the 'run like crazy, hes got chocolate', the fights, the talks, the mongi nights,  there is no1 else who i wud hv rather shared these moments with. ... thanx 4 being so affectionate..thanks 4 being soo caring  and most of all... thanku 4 just being there..u r the only person who i wont hv 2 ask to  'keep in touch' :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saumya-gupta">Saumya Gupta</a></p>
<p>Soft spoken, she is helpful and caring. She has a heart of gold. Fun to be around, her wits make her the center of attraction. A cool person to hangout with, she manages to juggle academics and social work with finesse. She is a friend who can be completely relied upon. She is one of the few girls in the campus, who has perfected the art of taking 'lite'. Will remember the arguments over writing the lab reports and the time spent in plannings to study for the exams. Her intelligence and sincerity will definitely help her to scale heights. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>She is soooo adorable and sweet and affectionate and always singing! :) I just can't imagine what a horrible disaster my labs would have been if she wan't there. Knows just how to deal with people and academics in a great fashion. Will certainly cherish your company and especially your radio which would start randomly with a random song at any random point of time :)
Wish you All The Best for your future. May u go and do what you want :)

<p>She is one of the first people I met when I came to campus. I still remember us standing in the registration queue when we first got talking. And the next thing we discover is that we have got adjacent rooms!!  I still remember our initial days in campus when we went out adventuring the remote areas of campus... The hunt for the 'perfect' tailor later (remember tailor aunty :P)… my never-ending long stories that I used to bore u and Poorwa with… the bonding that we shared!!! This bonding has seem to grown with each passing day. Today it seems a lot bit different and yet so similar… ur 2am knock in my rum craving for food… ur fortunate and unfortunate tales when u guys went out :P… our all-so-rare outings thats are filled with loads of fun and laughter…!!! All these 3 yrs have been simply amazing… and I m looking forward to much more fun when we come next yr (when u guys will be slogging thru CS CDCs and we I ll be bugging u all day-night long :P). Love u loads… keep smiling… be happy… its good to see u laughing and cheering all up around u :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankita-mahapatra">Ankita Mahapatra</a></p>
<p>i got to know her during our train journey from the campus to Delhi! She was the sole BITSian in that compartment and and God, what an interesting company she proved to be. a really really sweet girl, charming and bilkul mast! :) her personality comes across as a girl-next-door kind who is always smiling and lives her life to the fullest. i remember our occasional but random, fun gtalk chats! :)  i would have definitely liked to know her about more during our stay in the campus. keep smiling and spreading cheers khushboo, and all the best for whatever you do in your life. it was great knowing you (however li'l it was! )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>

<p>A pure “Punjabi kudi” who always has a cute smile on her face. She is a loving and caring person and a bit emotional. She easily makes friends with people due to her happy-go-lucky nature. An adorable person and a great friend. I have always enjoyed her company – listening to her amazing stories, her strict schedule during exams (I’ll always remember her saying “its 10pm 4 chapters left 2 hours per chapter, 6 baje tak course ho jayega” phew!!!! And she actually manages to do that). You and Saumya were the one who made me watch my first late night movie and a stupid movie indeed (I won’t mention the name ;)). There are endless memories and I don’t have words to express them all. I had a great time with you these 3 years and will miss you a lot :). Stay the way you are. May you achieve great success in life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>

<p>Ah so, where to start!!!… “Jeffrey Archer” -rem? Feeling extremely out of place, I had asked you for the novel  partly for respite and partly to strike a conversation… n am glad I did!  :) It has been an amazing journey since then… a wonderful person you are..always ready to help and very considerate..(ab toh kaafi change ho gayi hai :P) I soooo love pulling your leg… its awesome fun :D and you give me  every reason to do so…  every time you step out , there has to be a story full of drama( and emotion):P , your obsession with ur “udar” :P( yippee I got the better of u :D), your complaints bout “no jhappi”…  Will miss all of them… the long night talks… the knocks on my door…the hilarious anecdotes… everything and everything( some can’t be named here ;) ) just want to say, don’t think too much…n never ever change. <3 the way you are ?:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/poorwa-shekhar">POORWA SHEKHAR</a></p>
<p>Khushboo is one of the sweetest persons you will meet. She has an irresistible infectious smile and you really don't feel that you have just met her. She's innocent in her own dulcet way .. I haven't known her much but will surely get to know her more in the near future at least i hope so :P 

Have a great life and keep smiling.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-lele">Aditya Lele</a></p>
<p>ek ladki thi bholi si,pehli manzil pe woh rehti thi,juandice se woh pareshaan thi,ubla khana khati thi.....bahut filmy ho gaya but this was my first meeting with khushboo,she was just out of medc recovering frm jaundice and eating boiled vegetables...( always teased her khushboo tu abhi bhi peeli hai :P!).khushboo is one amazing,fun loving person( bahar ghumne ke liye everready).Has a carefree-zero tension mind (yes! atleast when compared to mine), does everything in the last minute,it takes a lot of effort to wake her up..., khushboo i will miss so many things, neeche utarte hi tere kamre mein aana,our random talks about random stuff.,cribbing about our weight and  related issues,our first maggi+night out,our shopping trips first for ur prom dress and then at panjim for your bhaiyya's wedding,cuming to ur room in the middle of the night coz i knew koi aur ho na ho khushboo toh pakka jagi hogi.......There have been times when we dont see or talk to each other for days but still that doesnt affect us in any way....a very affectionate friend ..u have always been there for me.... loooooovee you!!!!!!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-jain">sakshi jain</a></p>
<p>In our first ever Lab Visit, sir asked "which school are you from?" and the answer came from somewhere "Amity International School". I was surprised to know that there was someone else to from my school. I turned around and saw and there she was Khushboo Matreja. Didn't knew her very well at that time. But as time passed by things changed. She is one of those who never takes tension and haan kabhi bhura nahin manti. Great at academics and loves whatever she does(whether it is singing or eating). Remain as you are khushboo and you will surely do great in future. Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-dadu">Aditya Dadu</a></p>

<p>arrey i hve to say nice things here kya??????
chalo sun lo jhooth
Khushboo the F of our group and is a very awesome human being but very naive and innocent.
the best thing abt her is that little things make her very happy, there is no sadness that can bring her down.. except after exams, when she is jumping up and down with tension :P
omg .. how much she eats, u will see her in mess at all times- breakfst,lunch,snax and dinner..   Well we all; cant deny the fact she lost a lot of weight in summers(which is very  doubtfull.. i think she went to a weight loss clinic or something..hmm lets see...)
i have dared her to find a guy, which she is nt aware that its very easy fr her.. she is a charmer, she can easily get any guy she wants
sometimes i think she is a lil wannabe , but no .. i'm wrong she is just really sweet
she has no temper...wow... almost never angry...watever chudaap i do- thats a thing she should maintain in her life
i hope she turns out fat again so i can resume my fav topic of discussion 
and she achieves her dream .. bohot saare paise kamana  :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dev-rishi-khare">Dev Rishi Khare</a></p>
<p>In the past few years one trait has remained constant[] - your irrepressible personality[]. No matter how many times you put ur foot into ur mouth[] or end up in mortifying situations (lots of fun for us :P ) , u persist . Your one liners were so 'unique' i HAD to write them down :P all ur crushes , ur obsessing over them , nd d resulting drama n gossip made college life that much more colorful :P You r apparently 'cute'. What u certainly r is caring n childlike . Unable to sit in peace for more than 15 min , your ensuing fights with us (dev) r more entertainment for us :P ur wish to goto several random places remained mostly unfulfilled (at least whenever 
we were involved) :P You r d li8-est among the girls [][][]:P (happy?) :P and extremely hard to push over the edge [][]:P . You wear your heart on ur sleeve n r ridiculously easy to guilt trip :P my only advice would be - dont (lessen the extent atleast). Beyond that  i wouldnt change you for the world [][][]:) 
thank you for three years with never a dull moment :) tc :)  
ps- general public may inquire abt the [] if not self explanatory :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nachiketa-dash">Nachiketa Dash</a></p>
