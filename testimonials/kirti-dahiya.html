<h1 class="page-title">Kirti Dahiya</h1><p>You're probably first person I met in BITS. You're very hardworking and at the same time fun-loving.
I wish you great success for your future. Best of Luck<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>a very confident person!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>

<p>Kitty is one of those enigmatic personalities that are rare in this world. An honest friend to the close ones, Kirti has an aura that fills everyone with a bubbling sense of happy energy. She's one of my closest "parivaar" members and the sweetest of friends. One of my best moments with her is that day when we were singing Hoobastank - Reason walking on the beach syncing our voices. I feel really blessed to have found such an awesome friend.

And, Dahiya se zyaada ulajhna nahi chahiye bahut uunchi pahunch he iski :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-lele">Aditya Lele</a></p>
<p>Kamini!!

Thinking.........thinking......still all i can think is " Kamini hai saali!!"

Yaar I will miss you yaar.......pehli ladki hai tu jisko mai dil se, aur pyaar se gaali deta hu :D
I don't remember how we met for the 1st time, but since the 1st time i saw u, tere mai thodi gadbad hi lagti thi.......:P

She is a very good and caring friend, but very short tempered!! Better you be away from her when she is angry!! And she is tooooo good at making people fight and she is also good at studies but bahut rotlu hai......kitne bhi marks ayenge roti hi rahegi !! She also claims that she can eat a lot, so incase you thinking of giving her a treat, don't worry, she won't even make you spend more then 50Rs.

And yea she is also my ex's ex :P. All I like is too fight with her, we have awesome verbal fights.....

Tht's all......baaki she is useless.....

But seriously i am gona miss all the fights, outings and all the happy moments spent with you kamini......<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Well how can one possibly say  everything  about his/her girlfriend in a testimonial; but still I will try my best.She has been my rock.I can tell her everything and anything(sometimes she doesn't even wanna know so much info :P). Thou she is a big believer of selective hearing (and its the only thing keeping her sane :P) but still she manages listen to every crap I cook up.Whatever she does for you she will do it by heart and won't expect anything in return.Like most girlfriends she has her mood swings ( at times a lot of them) but then I love her too much to mind all that :P.She has some pretty crazy theories about life and herself and therefore I took up the role of being her shrink.Trust me I can actually put it up on my cv (pretty hard job people but then someone had to do it). One person I know I can always count on for anything.Thou she says I am too demanding(nakhrewali is the word) but then she fulfills all of them and so I keep on demanding :P.She herself doesn't even need food or sleep :P.She is fashion maniac who loves driving.Way too many memories with her.Not possible to list.College wouldn't have been the same without you.And I know love is over rated but then I do love you :-*.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>
<p>kirti!! hmmm... pagal auraat hai! she can be nice to everyone!! drives me insane!! sab ke liye accha thodi na ho sakte ho!! but then this female will show u how it is done ! :) she is a fashion maniac! and the glimmer pretty dresses bring to her kitty eyes!!! her pariwaar keeps her going and its nice being a part of it. Though this female needs to be introduced to joys of sleeping and eating! she says she can live on one pack of uncle chips!! drives me nuts !! the food gang is ready to take u up for rehab! but babes u have to put in efforts, rehab can take u only to a level, u need to get over ur fear of not eating! :P love laughing out loud with u! the world seems crazy with u! :P and she is cleanliness police! and even her room cleaning equipments (she has a room full of them :P )are also so damm pretty . everything about her is so pretty pretty ! :') <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apurva-mudgal">Apurva Mudgal</a></p>
<p>She is my monster mate and we are so crazy together! She is one of the moodiest people I have met but I have learnt to get along with it. One thing everyone gets wrong about her is that she is very sweet, it's unbelievable. Maybe it is because she talks all sweet to everyone.All the times we have scandalized mine and her neighbours( e.g. neha , gauri :P) are just so hilarious when I think of them .The times when i sat on my 'sitting' chair and we chatted and the awesome lounge sessions ;) and the non conversations with you doing your upside down poses and cheek massages and weird stuff, and our crazy dj nites when we just can't stop dancing and all our awesome trips, girl's days out and finding movies with hot guys,our obsessions with some tv shows and characters( jack, karen,neal caffrey,damon, mcdreamy!) and excited flight chats and the times when we just laugh for no reason and talk all kinds of crap are just some awesome memories :D She is super crazy when it comes to cleanliness and very organised. She is also very talented and creative,has a lot of hidden talents (like belly dancing ;)) She loves me in her own different way and has been an awesome friend.I have loved every moment with you and I know there are many more to come!(with you every day is a huge party! :D) love you :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>
<p>I think when God was moulding the angel 'Cute', he got real high and moulded a human being instead with similar traits.. A human being that i and many others have now come to know as Kirti Dahiya.. A very dear and close friend of mine.. Met u at Mongi first nd tabse to kamaal kar dittan.. Dahiya - Can u teach me the art of Weight Fluctuation?? i don't know how u do that.. She does it on free will for Heaven's sake.. :O Just unacceptable man.. :D...  Mere Flubbers Gang ki proud member!! Kya mast beetein hain ye 3 saal tere saath yaar.. 1 thing i would like to say about this amazing friend of mine.. You can really learn to smile from her.. And trust me that is one of the best qualities anyone can ever possess.. She sends out such a positive vibe into the air.. Bas phenk deti hai.. jisko pakadna hota hai wo pakad leta hai.. I've been holding onto this vibe for 3 long years now.. nd i guess the other members in our group have too :) She is so simple, insanely caring, never in double minds, has the 2nd coolest parents ever (after mine ;) :P ) and to top it off the ear to ear smile of hers.. Aye haye.. Kya kehne.. Can't be gloomy in her presence.. The Deadly Trio along with U and Bulbul is a new found obsession of mine.. Just can't do it without u guys.. Kirit, stay happy.. always have that electric smile on.. and abse jab bhi delhi station pe long stay karna padega to i'll drop by ur house instead.. :D pakka promise.. Loads of Luv!! Chalo ab Ice nd Spice pe Coffee Oreo ki baari :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mudit-sinha">Mudit Sinha</a></p>
<p>Kirti was one of my first friend in campus! I remember all the ragging sessions we had and the times in the hostel. My first outing after coming to college was with her! She's like a pataka of energy. I've always seen her smiling. And i absolutely love her dressing sense! We got close again thanks to ENI. All the micro lectures we sat through without listening to a single word he was saying, and lab sessions which just wouldn't have been fun without her excitement playing with the small weights and the capacitor bursting! And we're the chikni chamelis :P Kirti is a sweetheart and its impossible to not have fun around her. Its been great knowing you girl, Keep in touch :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Working with her in DoCW was the beginning of an awesome friendship with her. She's a very jolly girl with a carefree bindass attitude. She always has a smile on her no matter what the circumstances. She is the perfect example of the-beauty-with-the-brains. She always came prepared to all our labs (whichever we had common specially analog electronics), which helped us a lot. I wish her good luck for her future. May she reach great heights.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>

<p>well kirti has been a real support system....she has been the 1st one whom i would approach for any grade advice,campus advice,xyz advice nd stuff :P

<p>Kirti, the always energetic and ever smiling girl :) Pata nahi hum kaise mile, but jo hota hai ache ke liye hota hai :D We've had lots of fun during the fests that our beloved college brags about :P Be it gola or chat or what not. I have a typical way of greeting her and I love it :D (the head shake :P) The perfect example of how to be bindaas and do the necessary things as well. Sad that we met quite late. But koinaa, picture abhi baaki hai mere dost ! :D Stay the same and have a terrific life ahead :) Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Finally, I am writing macha :D
Ok, guys, gays and gals. This one is the most damn-the-world-when-i-have-a-sutta-in-my-hand girl I have met. Perhaps the fastest friendship that has ever grown, I knew no shit about her until my CDCs, and then things went on a ride. From the "yo, macha" pings to the random "mongi" walk abouts, she always had something interesting to say and even if its not interesting, she made it! One who really values friendship and no-nonsense about anything, she has been an indispensable part of campus life. The lesser I saw about the Spree Bogmalo trip, the better :P. 
Yaar, will always be there for you, even when I will be rolling something. Just dont call during any chinki affair :P Next sems gonna be weird with you guys around, so I think everytime you come, we need to go on a Panipuri Spree :P
All the best re :)
P.S: everytime you play dumb-charades, the only two word movie that exists on the earth is Katil jawaani :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sarthak-pranit">Sarthak Pranit</a></p>
