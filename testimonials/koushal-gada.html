<p>kaushal... the milk boy of the campus... a 31/2 year graduate ( :O)... is an awesome personality to be with... he is always cool and composed.. never looses his temper... too good at managing skills... apart from the usual things.. he loves sweets..  sometimes a single A mess sweet may serve his whole meal... and also carries a family pack with him... most of the ppl dont notice that... but when u touch his belly u might feel like he is a 5 month pregnant for sure :P and one more thing is dat he cant complete a sentence without a bad word in it... he never cares huz around him... :P and he attends all the classes without fail.. may be the classes he bunked in all these years can be counted on fingers... :-/ that doesnt mean he rocks all the subjects.. :P he goes to the class and sleeps there :P.. (may be the ac in the classrums will make him come to the classes for sleeping :P)... and he is always helpful :) will miss u kaushal... i wish u all the best for ur mba plans... :)  and also all the very best for his future... hope u stay in touch forever :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dammalapati-rakesh">Dammalapati Rakesh</a></p>

<p>this guys was like the touch me not initially, i wanted to talk to this guy , hung out with him but the moment i/any1 starts talking , he used to start a poem with 99% bad words and 1% abuse. I slowly got used to it and i always enjoyed every moment with him . i am still amazed at his determination to 1) go to classes 2) not eating ny thing other than jain food . 3) drinking  and other stuff he really follows, Hats off to u ra. U were always this great friend whom i can go to for any need. i really like your incredible zeal to work , working with passion and for the thrill/fun of it but not for certis etc, i truly commend u for that.  i am really going to miss u for the rest of my life. i sincerely wish u enjoy wateva u do . keep in touch mama .. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>Koushal or kaushal ...i am still confused?? I don’t remember my first encounter with kaushal but sure it was normal and casual. But little did I know that this cute little idiot would make my bits life this interesting..... he has extremely high socialization skills and mingles easily where ever he goes. Even though he looks so innocent and sincere (and attends all classes) this idiot was with us among all the pranks we played and is still by best sparring partner.  Determined, passionate, damn good at heart..That’s kaushal in some fancy words. He always helped me out in my acads and he is my guru in IS (No offense :P) . A very boring(yeah!!) chatter box and even if I find all those crappy topics u talk about as useless, u always finds a way to make me listen and before I know it I would be arguing with u (Damn u :P). Even though he is highly patient.. it takes me less than a minute to freak him out(now, I shd be good at sth. No?!) . After , u shd see him when he is high.. he is damn interesting and keeps on dancing until unless u go dance with him and make him stop(literally!!).wow my best dancing partner..dude u look kool dancing with ur tummy :P. I can never ever forget all those dances we did, mess we made in ash room, u helping me out when I am like completely out, u putting proxy for all the labs I bunked, talks we had (abt future? :P) , all those “useful” hours we spent in library, all the assignments and projects we took li8, thanx(even if u hate dis ;P) for whatever crap u made \m/. Even though it may look weird as no wants to complete their engg. life early…he ll complete in 7 sems and is still happy abt it (damn u :x) . I hope sth terrible ll happen and u ll come to college in second semester. Damn u idiot. Jokes apart, I am gonna miss you as my “bits buddy”. Anyways we ll be in contact so the psenti part can wait :P.  Hope u ll find what u r looking for and Bon voyage for the rest of your future. All the best buddy.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-gupta-akirala">Tarun Gupta Akirala</a></p>
<p>“kOushal” almost a graduate to the world but actually a kid for the ppl who know him (seriously true : )) Hmm…wat else one can say about a kid..?? :D
Though he is a kid he ended being my elder bro : ) (God knows how it happened :P )
One of best person I met in my life….he is so caring, patient, sincere and down to earth…I guess  may be because of these features…he is loved by so many ppl…. 
I just  can’t understand how can one be so innocent and selfless… every time he ends up doing things he hate just to make others happy….. That’s why he is gonna do social service too in future ( :) )… but u just need to stop it (at least now )….Plz do think of yourself at least after  caring for every person on earth ( :P )
My bro is talented also… ok :) He is info bank of the campus (for me and many more people ;) )….and a smart organizer too… very bad psychiatrist though ( :P )….so u r gonna rock your MBA future (right?? ) …. :) :)  
My bits life wouldn’t be the same without you in it… :( wish you weren’t leaving us so early :( :(
Will missss yuuu a lot….. :( :’( All the silly fights we had and all the nonsense we spoke   :( ….your kiddish behavior and me scolding u….ohh….will miss all these things… :(  (My chocolates especially  :P ) 
Hmm…All the Best for your bright future ahead….Wish you achieve everything you deserve in your life… :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/null">NULL</a></p>
<p>If u see bunch of girls ( more than 3-4) surrounding a a tall guy standing alone and that tall guy is always laughing and also has  a WEIRD MAX french Beard then its KOUSHAL GADA :P :P :P .  That doesnt imply hez a flirt.  He is the "Big Bro " of Ch 4, Ch 5 :P .  As said by rakesh, Hez the milk boy (even his thighs are too fair :P ) of campus :D.  He is one of the closest friend BITS life has given me ( No Senti plz :-| )....... Infact he has been a most lovable person evry1 wants to hangout with. ..........We got ragged together and i was Forced to put hand over his shoulder throughout the entire session :P..... ,,, But now i pull his hair atleast 1ce in day ( its too silky #gayish# :P ). ..... Although we weren't that close in till 2-1 , i dunno how but we suddenly got very close by the end of 2-2.  ..............He is (may be) the only one guy in campus who is interested into Psychology.  Though basically a gujju ,, hez nt kanjoos, gives tr8 whnever some1 asks for it :P.  He hates to be demanding over jnrs ( :O yes ) , likes to go to classes. Jus for your info he doesnt phodofy ne subject ,,, but jus..." ATTENDS" classes :P .  Hez one such person with whom i share evrything peronal. Tooo goood at socializing and too fast in texting :D ......... Always ready to help if u r his frnd NO MATTER HOW SHITTY POSITION U R IN....................  Hez a true hyderabadi ;-) in his language. Very innovative in giving gaalis \m/ ....and loves DJ nights :D.  His social network in campus begins from 2005 batch and i'm quite sure will extend till 2012 batch also :D.  Being an MBA aspirant , very good at managing things (which was evident when he was the DOFAM asset  cordi for WAVES) but sometimes freaks out in between and the worst part is evrytime he freaks out makes me laugh :D. ....... No matter how much crap u speak he always listen to it with all his concentration  (thats how so many girls stay arnd him #no offence to girls#  :P ) and at the same time VERY CARING. ....... He xpects himself not to marry ne1 but i'm quite sure he'l be the 1st 1 to get married amng all of us :D. ...... Some of the paradoxical issues abt gadha is  1. He never drinks nor smokes  (#jainism) but noes the amount of "highness" each of them give. 2. He is a vegetarian but noes which part of an animal tastes gud :-| and u can xpect the third paradox :-| ........... Nowadays he has become the talk of the campus since hez goin to complete his engineering degree in 3.5 yrs only ( _|_ u bitch) ........... I still dunno how he became this close to me but 1 thing i'm quite sure is my BITS life wud have missed something without him ( No senti plzz :-| ) . Hez one more guy whose chapter i'm not goin to conclude with my BITS life.... coz i'm quite sure i will keep meeting him staying in same city. Hope both of us get PS-2 allotted in same city. ........ Finally stay the way u r,,, u r one of the most unique person of ur kind. Will surely miss u in 4-2... But we'l rock again after engineering :-* :-* :-* ... \m/ \m/ <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/m-s-sandeep">M S Sandeep</a></p>
<p>Kaushal first time i saw u was on the day of our registration. I was shocked to know that he knows 7 languages :O later found out to be in the same branch. If anyone needs any kind of help his will be the first hand to help. Cool and takes everything ulti li8. But some times he goes crazy. We shared many things. Every moment with you is the best but the one which strikes first is the time when i yelled at u and ashwin. I can never forget your expressions that ni8. I thank god for sending me to the college that you were in, the hostel that you are alloted, the branch that you are pursuing... You are the bestest person that anyone can ever get. The way you took care of me when i was hospitalized I dont think any other can do that much. Cant even imagine that wonderful days of college life with you are coming to an end.  From now on I have to take care of myself :(( (hard though but had to)Its gr8 that you are completing your degree in less time but at the same time sad that you cannot be with us anymore. Anyways all the best for your future and obb we ll be in touch else ninnu vetukuntu vasta champadaniki...... and yea nee pelli lo racha racha cheddam as you ll be the first one to get married in our batch:P (Its true agree it). take care mama luv u and ll sure miss u :-* :)

<p>I will start with the word "3 1/2 yr graduate/early graduate"..This guy shld get an award for missing the least number of classes by any engineering student(Literally any student in the world)...He almost attended all the classes even wen he is not feeling well except wen he got affected from jaundice in his first year...Then i guess we can count the actual classes he missed in fingers....He used to spend all his time during xams in his first sem in lib...Still he used to not achieve wat he wanted...Apart from acads he is a great guy and funny to spend time with..He is frnd of everyone in campus i guess..Thats what i felt when i was along with him during first sem..he used to talk wid everyone in campus ..He spent most of his time in 1-2 with 4 yearites including sleeping in their room...I am one of the most laziest guys and he used to be solution to my problems of getting something to eat and giving clothes to laundry etc..He used to help everyone..He literally got involved in almost all 4 elections he has seen right from his first year to last one...Always helping ppl and always smiling without a sad face makes me like him even more and more.....I love this guy a lot...But i feel sad that he is leaving a sem ahead and I dont like this ...but its gng to happen anyways.,....All the best for ur future and I wont leave u anytime...so no byes :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
