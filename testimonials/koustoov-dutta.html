<p>It's really very comforting to know that you have a guy like Koustoov living next door. He has been an excellent neighbour. Very friendly and very helpful. He's a very talented footballer too and one of the most cheerful people I have met at BITS. I wish you a great success in the future.

<p>Koustoov!- the all round football playing, nerd. He is an awesome friend, with a great sense of humour and at heart a simple, down to earth guy. A fellow BONG to boot. Have a great life and career ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>Kos !!! Met this guy while playing carrom initially and were instantly bonded . 1St yr was too much fun be . Everyday we used to go to monji or ice n spice or for walks at night , even during the night before compre :) . Awesome days . Need not to mention you have one of the best laughter , very infectious . Yaad hai 1st sem either janmashtmi or ganesh chaturthi I was clicking pictures of random chicks from ur mobile and then the girl saw us :D , faak fati thi be . We planned wat to say if somebody beat us down :D . Very passionate football player and follower you are . I always wanted to have a friend like you man , you were a great coder and also a great help during  cp2 . Crybaby to u hai , rajat amrit will keep fucking with you for ages on this :D . He is in the prestigious Chu Club ri8 now , rightfully :P . We've shared some awesome times together man like the movies that we saw and the ones which we were never able to complete ( Paranormal 2 :D , my comp was restarting like a pig that day :D ), it'll be very hard to bid you good bye . Wish you all the best in life . Cheers !!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>
<p>I have so much to say about this guy. We are best buddies and to start with, this bongali guy is the coolest bong i know so far :P .. Awesome sense of humor, breaks the ice in any tense situation ( gand mein aag reliever must say :D ) We have many common things that we like like CS, FCB , 9gag and many more. He is pro at studying and from what subjects we studied together, i can safely assume he is a very logical guy and has great grasping power which is rare gift. Very good at programming and has been a helping hand in many subjects for me. A good CS player and teammate and calls himself n00b, ironically :P .. Extremely down to earth and i suggest him to be the same in future.. gives great company in NC and Shahi/Claudy.. Most of the time he says things which are quite obvious and forces me to say " you dont say ? " .. loves to say BITCH PLZ and BITCH go make me a sandwitch..hope hes doesnt continue at home :D .. Tharakpan bhara pada hai salle mein.. big fan of Austin Kincaid ( google if u dont know :P ) But sadly our journey ends here :'( and i am badly missing our bike trips, our audi chudaap, NC sessions, football...and what NOT :(

I just hope you continue to be this cheerful and fun-loving guy.. All the best :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amrit-mann">Amrit Mann</a></p>
<p>kos..once u've met him,its impossible to ever forget him.i've known him since 11th std and nw hes one of my best friends.a very hardworking nd modest person(um..mayb too much :P).im proud to say i ve turned him into a football fanatic..he probably curses me for it :D we share a lot of common interests especially movies and muzic.he has learnt a crazy number of programming languages and is really passionate about coding...i still cnt figure out y he didnt take up comp science.a pro gamer- gave me a hard time in cs and plays almost any game with equal proness :D In almost every good experience i've had in these 4 years, kos has always been a part of it... bike trips,bogmalo nights(esp claudis),football,movies.... a great friend to have..i hope we always stay in touch no matter where we end up.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunal-sharma">kunal sharma</a></p>
