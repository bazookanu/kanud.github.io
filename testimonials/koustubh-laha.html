<h1 class="page-title">Koustubh Laha</h1><p>Koustubh’s story is a story of love (how he finally found it at the fag end of college) and sacrifice (how he stayed back for a sem even when he could have passed out, for the sake of his friends). He seemed weird before I got to know him. Afterwards, it turned out he was much weirder than I had thought. He goes about his work in a calm, neat, jolly sort of a way. Although he doesn’t seem to know it, he is a bit of a… womanizer? Flirt? Serial-friendzoned-person? I can’t make out. Also, he is very caring. If I was a girl, I would even go to the extent of calling him sweet.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>

<p>Koustubh, the first time I met him was in the Ah3 common room, he in a sleeveless vest, and those god-awful mustache, playing carrom, and naturally, i was like- what the hell is wrong with this kid!! As time progressed, he struck me as an immature kid, a bit too friendly with the ladies and a complete momma's boy. My aero buddy, and fellow 'EnI'ian I will always miss him for his innocence, creativity, dedication and hard working nature. Keep rocking buddy. All the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ahut-gupta">Ahut Gupta</a></p>
<p>Koustubh Laha … He has been my friend since the past 9 years (we met in 6th standard) and trust me he hasn’t changed. He is very caring, a little childish (everyone would agree :P) and humble. He is an awesome artist, very good in Maths, creative, hardworking, dedicated and always willing to help you in need. 
I wish you all the best for your future Koustubh. May you soar high and achieve what you desire :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Koustubh is a very kind and selfless person, very creative with his work. Very sincere and hardworking, always has longest reports for all labs(obviously takes a lot of time and pain in preparing them). He keeps me updated with whats going on in classes and helps me understanding instrumentation courses. Teacher's pet (Gautam Bacher's ...:P). Loves friends very much.He is always cheerful and smiling(never saw him angry). I wish him all the best for his future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankeerth">Sankeerth</a></p>
<p>Koustubh - always cheerful and smiling. He is always ready to help, very hardworking and a good friend. He is my library buddy with whom I have studied for all my CDC's. I wish him all the very best for his future :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Koustubh is the quintessential moma'a boy in our group. His incessant need to keep calling his mom evoked quite a hilarious response from us since the beginning. A really nice guy and fun guy to hang out with. We once had written a poem about his oily shiny nose back in our first year. Another notable feature of this abundantly haired human are his sexy notes. Neat, ordered and beautifully calligraphed his notes are like the bible for many of the EEE/ENI students paralleled only by a few girls. He also had the most number of female friends amongst us which by the way you must read chinmay's testi for more details...Have also shared a lot of Split Second memories with him - how we both kicked abhijeet n jayants ass and then how he kicked mine :X Thanks for everything Koustubh, and all the best...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>Koustubh has always been my lab partner in every possible course! So we've had great times in labs, when i got him to do quite a bit of my work in workshop :P and then he made the work piece too small :-/ :P He's been a great help through all my CDC's with all the notes he so beautifully makes in every single class! Its been great knowing you. All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Koustubh is the BEST neighbour you can ask for in this college! Notes, reports, codes, and everything else in between, he has em all. Over the years, he has helped in so many things that i cant imagine sailing through my courses the way i have without him in the room next door. From fixing laptop/internet issues to helping me find things in my own room- you can count on him for almost anything. Him cheerfully barging in my room every now and then always leads to fun propositions. From tracking down profiles of girls faking to be a bitsian on FB to coming up with crazy gag ideas, masti never ends. I sometimes feel that his day has 30-40 hours because he does so many things, from downloading GBs of anime to writing magnificent reports to getting great marks, he does it all....and the best part is that he never decides on his actions on the basis of others opinions. Many a mighty have changed their habits (from good to bad) due to peers but not him. And its for this that i respect him the most. P.S. - Please someone give him a room in CH1. I would treat you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jayant-dalmia">Jayant Dalmia</a></p>
<p>Koustubh… The guy who probably know almost all the people in campus. Fun loving, talkative and extremely friendly… He can be friends with anyone… In fact, it takes him less than five minutes to be friends, or rather I should say to be acquainted with, anyone. Stalwart member of docw...He loves decorating things, especially report: I remember for our trw report, all my other group members just wanted to finish it somehow, but he was even interested in adding extra things (mostly photos etc) to our report. Loves driving and watching animes…One can almost always see his name(klm) in front of some downloaded anime on dc.
Wish you all d best for your future endeavours...keep making friends :)

<p>Our first conversation outside C-mess, after aero club meeting lasted for an hour. A wonderful and hardworking person that he is, he has made our DoCW days memorable. In his tummy's honor, we have declared 18th Oct as the Tummy Day :P. I am sure even girls must be taking inspirations on how to take notes from this guy. Always be the kid that you are and take a good of that tummy for us! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kedar-deshmukh">KEDAR DESHMUKH</a></p>
<p>We rarely meet people who are so friendly, ..yes, Koustubh is one of those who befriends people quickly and effortlessly. ..A very hard working, helpful, good at heart and down to earth person, he is one of a kind. …Have seen him work very  hard for DOCW (from the awesome shoe painting workshop I attended!! ?). I wish you all the best for all your future endeavours. May you scale heights! :)?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
