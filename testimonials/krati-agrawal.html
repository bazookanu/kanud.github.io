<h1 class="page-title">Krati Agrawal</h1><p>An extremely talented and dedicated Engineer.
Krati was one of my PS1 mates at SKF, Pune.She is the student any Teacher would be proud to teach!
The Mechanical Handout should actually say-
1) Text Book 1
2) Reference Book 1
3) Krati's notes
Seriously!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Well, hard working as always. very humble and kind. One of those persons, you will be easily impressed with. The time spent with you was just great sis. Just be the wonderful person that you always are.

To add to all above, She has got a great passion and desire for success which shows in the hard works she puts in. She probably knows more than one way of how to top any exam. and apart from that she is just great with frns too, always helping them out and her notes are a popular reading material in mechanical :P. Have a great life ahead sis... No doubt you will get all what you wish for. All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Krati Agrawal - The reason why more than half of the Mech students will be able to hold a degree in their hands :) A really modest and helpful person. She is one of the smartest and the most hardworking students in BITS. Apart from excelling in acads, she is a creative and artistic person as well. Im not sure I am ever going to come across such a simple and yet beautiful person ! Best of luck and keep rocking as always :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p> A very humble and sincere person.  I got to know her more during our PS! together at SKF...About her, well, she is the true Mech queen. all mech guys should pay our tution fees to her, considering that we would not be getting our degrees if it weren't for her notes. All the very best. YOU \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>The Queen of Mech '09 batch. Krati is someone you will meet in the beginning of the class and feel like she is just a normal kid losing interest in what the prof is saying but only when the exam results are out will you know that she topped every single paper there was! On a more serious note, I must say she is an awesome person and her down-to-earth nature makes her even more special. Having worked with her in Arts & Deco, I know for a fact that her painting is as good as her acads. With this nature she will get what she wants :P and I wish her all the best for her future. \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Krati has taught me two things: The value of sincerity and Mechanical Engineering.
A talented artist, an excellent student, a deadly combination of smartness and hard work and such a modest and friendly personality makes her one of the best persons I know.
Attention ALL Companies: Hire her SPONTANEOUSLY!
Best of luck Krati!
and thank you for your notes...and thank you for being such a wonderful person!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>The Undisputed Queen, respected and revered by all. Darling of all the faculty and a nothing short of a goddess for more than half the mechanical batch. I am yet to come across a more down-to-earth person than her. Benefactor to so many students for obvious reasons and yet not a shred of arrogance in her!! A wonderfully simple person who will always be remembered as the quintessential engineering student and a remarkable friend to all those who knew her. Her future is indubitably very bright and here's wishing her all the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>probably one nicest people i know....a great person to talk to and i am glad to have met her during my ps1....always smiling and full of life she is a great person to be around...i am sure that with your hard work and dedication you are gonna reach great heights..all the best and it has been a pleasure to know you<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-deshpande">Aditya Deshpande</a></p>
<p>If I would want to learn on how to work hard and get results out of it, it will be from Krati. I think she redefines the word 'open-source' in her own way. Her selflessness in sharing notes, painstakingly made sitting in drab lectures, still make people wonder, "why is she sharing this with everybody?" But when you ace every course you take, others' performances don't matter. Haven't known her for much long, but then it doesn't take much long for one to realise the great person she is...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jayant-dalmia">Jayant Dalmia</a></p>
<p>Notes waali didi, this woman has got an amazing capacity for first attending classes, then actually paying attention and finally writing EVERY freaking thing the teacher says or writes. Mech '09 wouldnt have been the same without you. Thanks a lot for that, A wonderful person, with immense patience and a pleasant personality. It was great getting to know you.  I'm sure you'll do great in life. (She was a close runner up to the nerd queen Na-real award btw).
P.S: Compre aa raha hain, please dmv ke notes de dena :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>She is a fun loving, cheerful girl. An idol for everyone, she is the best student a professor can ever have. Always ready to help with a big smile, she always lends her notes thus saving the face of most of the students and the mechanical faculty as well. Whenever you have doubts, she is the one you would definitely look to. Her smile can brighten up anybody's day. She can be best described as a complete person, having all the skills in the world. Wish you luck for your future and hope that you reach greater heights. Good Luck !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>The undisputed queen of mechanical, Krati is probably the only person I know who manages to be dedicated and easy-going at the same time. And Krati's notes!! They help all the students of mechanical, take a stand against the fury of exams. Word on the street: If you have Krati's notes, you can easily score av+, come what may!! And she's surprisinly selfless in sharing it with everyone. Makes everyone wonder, "That's it?? No strings attached??" If she had charged every person who had borrowed her notes, she would have become a billionare!! I don't know her well enough; but i know this... For the kind of person she is, she'll achieve heights that others can only dream of. Wish you all the very best for your future. Rise and Shine. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-balakrishnan">Siddharth Balakrishnan</a></p>
<p>Krati is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. I have known her since the beginning of our time in BITS.  She cares a lot about her friends and it has always been really wonderful spending time with her. Over the course of the past year or so during her mechanical CDCs, she has achieved a Demi-God status. She has aced every subject and her excellent notes have been priceless for almost everyone in her batch. :D Legendary stuff.  She's undoubtedly the best mechanical engineer in BITS Goa. Despite this, she's extremely humble and I admire her a lot for her sincerity and talent. Pro! _/\_ She's very gifted at painting too and has worked on some memorable exhibits for arts and deco. It's been a pleasure knowing you, Krati and I'm sure that you'll make it really big in life :) All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Having known Krati for a couple of years, I can say with conviction she is best friend I have ever had. An excellent academician, a good dancer, a passionate artist, and above all a wonderful person. Shall cherish the time I spent with you in college all through my life<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sourav-banerjee">Sourav Banerjee</a></p>
<p>Krati, I met you in weird circumstances. You claim to met me on the train to bits too but i don't have any memories of the same. My first impression about you was pretty average but as time rolled by and we became good friends, i got a better insight of you. Now I can say this with 100% confidence that you're extremely genuine at heart. I really adore you, your charisma is inexplicable, something which i wish to achieve in my life. You've helped me in almost every way a friend could help, be it getting dressed up for a date or deciding gifts to please my sister or be it sitting with me and explaining those bio-chem part in Chemistry 2. I can mention all the things that you've done for me but i dont want to make this long. I just want to thank you for all the favors. I wish I could return them one day... Have a greatest of life, BEST OF LUCK !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>The twinkle eyed "urban" (:D) girl from Guna has been a pleasure to know...From lending notes to laughing even at my saddest jokes she has always had by back...Caring,compassionate,dedicated,sincere,altruistic (when it comes to notes) these are some words which describe her...Will miss the time spent at Monginis (Nimbu Paani ice-cream :D) or the leg-pulling...Keep smiling like you always do :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anirudh-mohta">Anirudh Mohta</a></p>
<p>Krati is the most sincere and dedicated student of Mechanical Engineering. Aced all her courses. Very simple and humble. I was introduced to her during my PS1 at SKF, Pune.  She speaks pure Madhya Pradesh Hindi very nicely.  I think that she should be granted multiple BE Degrees in honour of the success of the students who studied from her class notes!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>I never actually had any sort of formal introduction with her... For many a semesters all i knew about her was the what the photos of her class notes told me.. And let me tell you.. those described her a lot... She's one of the most sincere and hardworking students.. and one of the very few who are actually passionate about what they learn in this institute... Her dedication is reflected in her beautiful notes and one can write annals about her selfless and helpful nature... She's always there to solve the doubts whether on Gtalk or phone.... Later i got to her know her through friends and through Arts n Deco.. she is a very talented artist.. and a real fun person to hang out with.. She is truly a very wonderful person who seems to be always smiling.. I hope, sorry , I am sure you will succeed in whatever path you choose for yourself... Keep smiling and enjoy life. I hope that someday in future we meet again. And lastly, I want to make another painting next waves with this girl.. just so that I get to know her better :P. 
Three cheers for the true mech queen !

<p>Few wonderful words can describe a lot about some people. But for Krati didi, no matter how much wonderful you will say about her, everything will just shy out. She is someone who knows, in whatever she does, what to do and how to go on about it. Her work always resembles the opposite of aimless. When I first came to work in Arts N Deco, I had to work with her and Bhavya Didi, not that I would have chosen anyone else if given the choice. I was cluless, but they both taught me how to do what and "when" and also the most important lesson while painting - one does not simply spill water over finished paintings. It was really a joyride working on that painting, working as you are learning. And I wished I got the same partners in future paintings as well. When working on the RoboKombat team, she showed her leadership skills by managing between classes and RoboKombat. She didn't order us about but worked with us like a team and worked hard. 3rd year is quite hectic and she had to be nerdy all the time. In fact, I even voted her the Nerd Queen, wonder why didn't get it though. But it wouldn't affect her, she will continue to be a nerd and concentrating at the things that are at hand while also keeping an eye on the close future. I wish her good luck for her future(not that she needs it though), and hope that she succeeds in all her endeavors. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ateendra-sharma">Ateendra Sharma</a></p>
<p>"Krati MAA" You are one of the sweetest persons i know! Its just so easy to be around you and joke about random stuff!!! Seriously as focused and artistic as you are, you still need to stop ... PW :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yashu">Yashu</a></p>

<p>"Karti Devi humko bacha lo." This is the line I invariably say before all our exams to her. Krati is a gem of a person. Hardworking, friendly, sincere and intelligent she is one of my really good friends. The entire mech batch of 09 bannks on her precious and perfect notes without which all of us would have been ruined! :P The thing I like best about her is that she is always ready to help you no matter what. Her politeness and charisma can win over your heart in a jiffy. It's a great feeling to be her friend and I hope our friendship goes a long way. All the best for your future. Cheers!

<p>Krati is like my alladdin's lamp always there when i need something ! Food, Focussed study ,Gossip , Entertainment or a reason to laugh ; every moment spent with her is priceless :P The pre-examination studying in your room which is like my favourite library on the cute little study table ( dont worry i love you too much to kill you for it :) ) or trying on clothes which i have never before and being a source of entertainment for you and arushi make the best moments of my college life :) With her calm demeanor , deligence and smartness she has been acing mech courses with an art which leaves you astounded ! Her domain of extra curricular and co -curricular is equally impressive :) from those lovely paintings which adorn campus during fests and even later to being an office bearer in the campus ASME chapter she has all done it with an impact. Armed with such credentials an assured admit to one of the prestigious B schools and with  an awesome personality she will soon be hot cake among the corporate houses ! Saying goodbye and wishing you good luck is totally out of the question ! Both are unnecessary , what say  :-*

It was fun sharing seats through the boring lectures, doodling, cribbing, gossiping, the treats between classes and what not!!
We still have a sem together, so no bidding adieu now…hope to have all the more mastii :D  keep rocking!!!

<p>Guna ki dharti par jab koi bachha rota hai, toh uski maa use kehti hai ki beta, chup ho ja, nahi to krati aa jayegi! :P aisa khauf rakhti hai saali! “ye aur ladki?uppar uppar se? packing ukhaad kar dekha andar se 10 hatthe gathhe launde bahar nikal kar aayenge!” this is what describes Krati Agarwal. College mein pehle din mili, to aisa laga tha ki pata nahi bechari si hai ekdum sehmi sehmi rehti hogi, par wo to sab sirf mummy papa ke saamne tha! Fir pata chala thode time baad, ki machau bandi hai! Ultimate cool, iske paas jakar kabhi bhi kuch bhi bol sakte ho.. raat ko 3 baje agar uthkar sabse pehle kisi ko call karne ka mann hota hai, to wo to tu hi hai! Mast rehti hai hamesha! Haan kabhi kabhi senti ho jaati hai(jab paper mein sirf av+10-15) aate hain tab, kabhi kabhi toh khana bhi miss kar deti thi aisi baato par! Bahot hi jyada down to earth aur helpful hai! Ek energy si carry karti hai apne sath, ekdum dekhkar masti karne ka mann hota hai iske saath!
We hve had awesome times, weird times, and sad times, and she has been there always! “Relationships and their Maintenance” mein to PhD kar rakhi hai. Sab kuch ekdum sahi bolti hai, bahot hi rationally. Cricket ki gajjab fan hai. Ghar ki laadli rahi hai hamesha, isliye yaha par bhi ghar ko kaafi yaad karti rehti hai, kahaniya sunati hai, aur “ethu sa” senti ho jaati hai. Marwadi hone ka to garv hai, aur Kolkatawaalo ko dara-dhamkakar rakhti hai (:P) Mere liye toh u are sumwhere between a sister and a gf.. I cannot just write here alllll those incidents in life that we have had together! But thanks for being there always! Touch mein to hamesha rehna hi hai! :D

<p>Krati - Role model. Starting from those terrible, terrible days of MT1 Chemistry, I've really looked up to you. It takes a really different person to simultaneously have perfect notes from every class, have reports ready for all desperate group members to copy, come up with lines for child labourers/marketing strategies for fictional salons, stay up till three in the morning working on Arts and Deco, and still always have a smile to brighten the day of everyone they meet. We've had some crazy times together, but it's always been fun! I'd wish you best of luck, but you don't need luck... you're truly unique and with your attitude and talent, you'll definitely achieve everything you set out to do. :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>
<p>Hi krati . Even though I don't know you personally, I just wanted to say that I'm another of those lazy mech guys in your batch and without your class notes I would not have understood A,B,C of any of the mechanical cdc's and other courses. I've read more from them than any textbook! A huge huge thanks for sharing all those notes and with that kind of sincerity I'm sure you'll make it big in life. May God bless you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>so where do i start? one can safely assume that without your notes, I would have got C,D and Cs in my CDCs. Even though I dont know you very well personally, I do know that your humility, sincerity and dedication will take you a long way in life. It's astonishing how so many people ask you for notes and not once have you thrown a tantrum!! Simply unbelievable.. Wish you all the success and happiness in life. I am a huge fan of yours for these reasons and I am sure that one day I will say, " Hey thats my friend.  We were classmates in college"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>Ever imagined being trapped in a valley with Mt. Everest on each side?? This is what happens in case of people whose ID nos lie between Poorwa and this girl in terms of marks. But a good thing that we get to see our marks as well as topper's marks on the same page. 
We started knowing each other a bit late becoz of her habit of attending all the classes and my habit of not attending. But thank god that she attends all the lectures.(you know why). My sources tell me that people get inferiority complex if they sit just behind her at the time of exam :P I have experienced it too. Krati sab khatam karke paper check kar rahi hogi aur apna kuch solve nahi ho raha hoga. Its a wonderful scene just before the exam in the examination hall when all people gather around her and ask her doubts.( Ob she clears them all) 
She has a very good knowledge of mech things.No need to explain about her notes which are like SI system ( accepted universally and referred by all mech people)
Ob u r a pro. Wish your proness increases more and more and pls mujhe apni company mein job de dena.... pls... All the very best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Krati, even before I met you, you started helping me. You unselfishly give your notes before the exam to one of us and we would takes pics and share it with others. I never start studying until I get your notes.I know many people who don't like sharing their notes.Undoubtedly you have increased both mine and the whole mechanical batch cg! Every monday morning I can sleep in peace till 10 because I know you are there in class writing notes for us. I can think of no one person who has helped me with my acads more than you have. The least I can do for you is write you a testimonial. From me and the whole mechanical batch '' Thank you and We love you Krati !!'' Wish you all the best for you future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>I can't resist! Thank you again!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Krati...!! An amazing person..so cheerful, good at heart hardworking, skillful, intelligent, caring and what not !!! I have known her since.. my 1st year ! I remember how you and Arushi celebrated my first b'day in BITS.. :-* with all the coke, chips, cake that you used to make a mountain on my head ! And yes helped me in cleaning my corridor on my b'day to escape from nirmala's fury.. ;) lol ! MAST !!! This would always remain fresh in my memory !! :D Whenever you need help, go to Krati and there she will be cheerfully and willingly extending a helping hand without an itch !! Great entertainer.. she is !!

<p>Krati Devi blah blah blah, Mech Queen blah blah blah, Pro notes blah blah blah, ultra phodu blah blah blah, well you know the drill, fill in the superlatives yourself :P. She indeed deserves all these titles and more importantly (though her grades/cg say otherwise) she is <b>NOT</b> a nerd, well for the most part except that week during exams. From what I perceive she is a phenomenon, a legend, a Goddess for all the mech people atleast. She is super-human. Well, enough about her epicness in academics. Time for the qualities that make her a wonderful human being. She is smart, intelligent, hardworking, sincere, ever-helpful, jolly, humble, amiable, an amazing artist, <b>a great friend</b>, breakfast devi and again blah blah blah. Fill in the words, I can't seem to find enough adjectives. <p><b><i>In short you are awesome !! :D</b></i><p>
Will always cherish the frequent non-sense dinner talks, your numal/consys notes(only subs we had in common :P), basically all of the past 2 semesters. Wish I had known you earlier or taken mech, may be mere grades achhe aate :P. Best wishes for your future. You are destined for something great.
