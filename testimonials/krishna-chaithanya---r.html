<p>Krishna aka KC, I must say he's an intellectual guy and knows everything (almost) about every dept. on campus, festivals, politics, and about every damn guy! to say the least. A very dynamic personality with superb observational skills. He is very rational ans straightforward in his approach with great ideas and solutions for every other problem. He knows "who is he" which most of the people ignore. He has taught me many things, and will forever remember those beyond EPIC "all night discussions", to be specific from 12AM - 4AM " we generally have once a while. (on anything, my fav. - " The twinkle in the eye" :) ) Hes a great help too, has helped me in many ways ;) To sum it all a great guy to have around and not to forget his contribution to "RoboKombat" Event during Quark, the event has reached great heights under him. One more thing, if you want to tell your secrets to someone, hes perfect. I wish him all the very best for an incredible, and a wealthy future ahead :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>KC..!!! I didn't even know his real name, I had to check SWD for that to write this testimonial. I have only heard about how hard working you are and how motivated you are and so on. But I still remember that day when we met near the library lawns after the dance night. The intensity with which you were explaining, I simply admire your enthusiasm and love for whatever you do. I instantly told Nidhi to pen down your number, you are gonna be the first person we will turn to, for any help.
And of course my first and most special memory was when I was sitting with Arpit bhaiyya and you on the staircase of your hostel at 3 am. I was rude and disturbed. I so loved it when you shouted at me and brought me back to my senses.
KC bhaiyya, I will always admire you for what you are and look up to for advice.
Best of luck for future, its gonna be bright :-) :-) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>
