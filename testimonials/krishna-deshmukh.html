<h1 class="page-title">KRISHNA DESHMUKH</h1><p>KD, is a really cheerful guy. keeps smiling. though his regularity in all lectures sometimes annoy me, but being such a soft spoken and friendly guy, he just enchants you! 
i have had some awesome moments with him during the third year, will always cherish those. 
he'll keep traversing the entire floor of his corridor talking to everyone he meets. thats the best part about him, you wont find this guy holding grudges with anyone ever, he wont mind anything said about him. he doesn't have the slightest trace of ego in him. 
all the very best for your future, keep smiling and stay in contact! :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>Arrey KAYHDEE!!This shy personality from Jai Maharashtra has been my neighbour since day1.The first year went by with almost zero interaction with this guy,he would simply not stay in his room thanks to the library keeda in him.But as time went by he mingled more and more with the corridor people and today he is one of the core members of our group :D.I really don't understand what this guy wants to do with his life but he is a hardcore Bollywood fan,loves arts,is not very enthusiastic about his branch,a man of simple taste,friendly and always has that one look on his face seeing which we all shout in one voice-ARREY KAHDEE!! All the best my dear friend :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>Krishnaji - aap to sarvagya hain aur sarvagyani hain :) On first glance he looked like a crazy nerd from Aurangabad but only if you get to know him well will you understand he is simply awesome. The fun times we had in TRW were just, well how to put it in words, LEGENDARY with such a great teacher :P. Our occasional mess visits together have always been delightful. His simple yet smart nature will take him to greater heights and he is all set for a bright MBA future :) All the best buddy, Keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Krishna is one of the best friends I have had at BITS and I spent a major chunk of my 1st year with him. He is very friendly, simple, charming and down to earth. He is extremely sincere, very honest, dependable and will go out of his way to help his friends. We have had crazy conversations about many things and BITS wouldn't have been the same without your fantastic company. Thanks a lot and all the best for your future endeavors :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Having known Krishna for past three years ( we met during/around nettech course in 1st sem ), I can say that he is a very sincere ( attends a lot of classes and extra classes :P) person with a very positive attitude ( have never seen him tense about anything till date ) towards everything in life. He has deep interest in mathematics which I can say after doing almost all my math-related courses ( hmmm.. 2nd year onwards ) sitting by his side and getting my doubts cleared during lectures :). I would always remember the times we've spent together ( including, of course, standing under the sun during spree :P ) over these years. I wish him all the best for the years to come. Hope to stay in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunwar-kanishk-singh">Kunwar Kanishk Singh</a></p>
