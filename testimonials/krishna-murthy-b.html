<h1 class="page-title">Krishna Murthy B</h1><p>Krishna Murthy aka 'mayya' is a funny guy and definitely worth spending time with him...He is  a big fan of T.V series(Mind it -any T.v series) and  I never watched any T.v series and still he tries to explain me the scenes and story plot of series he saw . I will just act like listening though i would end up listening most of the part. Apart from that he used to tell me the 'special acts' of EEE faculty and use to blame them. I guess this is the guy who has the lowest confidence on oneself I have ever seen in my life. He can do things in reality but he  stop himself from doing anything because of his confidence level. If he works hard he can definitely achieve many things but he doesn't put that effort. Recently he got addicted to poker and looses many times and wins sometimes....But he says that he is winning it ..... I strongly believe that he can achieve many great things in his life if he starts to believe in himself and I guess he will have an happy life..mayya dont forget that life is beyond just T.V series and other stuff you do..Go ahead and achieve something in life ..Hope you will have a nice life.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
<p>Krishanmurthy aka MAYA  saviour of EEE grades ....a brilliant shishya of mine...and a good frnd too.
He is one of the best poker players i have seen with a perfect  poker face and a  damn perfect poker attitude. Iam feeling proud to say that “I introduced poker to him”   He is a biggggg  fan of tv series and missed most of fun college life because of that. Most importantly he is the best person to talk to wen ur confidence is running low. A perfect funny person ........and  I  cant forget the day wen u got high with a half pint :P........dude i want to give u a free advice “plsss don’t  don’t ever ever try to drink **** ...they r not meant for kids”....be satisfied with colas :P. He is one the unique ...unique persons i have ever seen...thanx a lot for the  fab india shirt which  u gave me as a gift :P. 
Plsss don’t use that “hard core” word  ppl may mis –inter-pret.
Intelligent.....intelligent....intelligent......thats murthy for me
ALL THE BEST for ur future.:)
