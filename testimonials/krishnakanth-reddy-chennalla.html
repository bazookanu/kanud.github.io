<h1 class="page-title">Krishnakanth Reddy Chennalla</h1><p>KK our beloved SPREE convener. Most lovable, kind and his concern for friends are his best qualities. He is always cool and never gets angry (except once against rss) how much ever you piss him off. Always supportive to me whenever I am trouble and understanding the problems of others and being sensible to them. No one can ever miss you if once they become friend with you. Always stay in touch. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
