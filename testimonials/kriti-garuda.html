<h1 class="page-title">Kriti Garuda</h1><p>Kriti! It was the very first sem when i met the "bungee-jumping chic" who would go for every physics class and put attendance for me without even knowing me and then there were the compres which got screwed in an epic way because of our countless sessions of Prince of Persia and Claw and somewhere between these two we became the "married couple" that we are today. One of the sweetest, most caring and extremely genuine people that i have met. You are someone very hard to miss in a crowd and i m not saying that because of your loud, booming voice but that sheepish kid like smile that you always have on your face. From our bike trip, night outs, bogmalo days, all the "dates" we went on to our crying, cribbing, gossiping, case taking sessions & fights or rather fight (no wonder we are so compatible) i will miss each one of them. I love it how every time someone mentions food and your face just lights up (remember the "JUICE!!"). Oh and that reminds me you are a very kind and giving person but when it comes to your food ( and now aero also) you can go to the extent of killing the other person! (just had to write that).If it wasnt for your numerous pranks, stupidities and embarrassing moments, college life would have never been the same for me. Hoping for many more happily married years with beautiful children! :P Love you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Kriti, or as I first knew you, shuriken. I think we first properly met at the TITAN outing, before that I just knew you as Arushi’s friend. And of course there was that time during your PS when you used to rant about how sad your station was. An outspoken and very loud person you may be, but I’ve also come to know you as fun loving and very open about everything(though your mom might have a hand in that).  Over the year, I’ve come to recognize you as a good friend, and I hope that will continue in the future too. Adios ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-bhatt">Chaitanya Bhatt</a></p>

<p>From Zimmern and Bourdain to Transliterations, we've discussed it all. Hundreds of Gtalk Chats, her awesome PS Station, FB Dessert Fights and similar grades in our tests are the things we know each other through. One of the craziest people I've met, She's always been the most fun to hang around with. An Aubergine Lover [:P], full of zeal to try new things and a vivacious personality, Kriti has Planes to Fly and lots to conquer. Wishing her the best in life.

<p>That beautiful chick in 1-1 working on shaper in workshop after coming almost 20 days late to college, people starring at her and this scene is still fresh in my memory. Chirag complaining and going mad after seeing the workpiece but then this gal  ( ?  d00d ? ) has been one of the best friends I have made on campus.

First impression - female who shouts and blabbers so much unnecessarily to a friend who talks sense and entertains you its been a good journey ( GT ? ) till date. 
People know her more as SHURIKEN, her DC nick for her endless chudaap on the mainchat and opchat ( Yes I was an admin on THAT hub :| , her rants and the way she cribs about things is simply hilarious. B4A8 is what I m proud and lucky coz I have her next year also ( this year it helped me to gain confidence to miss class ) to entertain and be there to have fun and enjoy some good time. 
She isnt just about shouting, chudaap, food ( YES ) and her DC, she is the Co-Ordinator of the Aerodynamics Club on campus , I know many people would have been astonished to hear this but then she has worked hard to show those beautiful aerial views of the campus with her camera and her flights. 
She is a great food eating monster who wants to eat different cuisines every time she goes out but sadly she is PURE VEGETARIAN. When it comes to drinks, she drinks but rarely and when she does its a treat to watch. 
Those endless random bullshit gtalk chats or Arushi's Facebook Status Msg chudaap I cant forget it all. Any chudaap on campus or outside and its kriti whom I would like to share and talk my heart out, she is one of the those trustworthy friends on campus to whom I can share small bits and chudaaps.  
Her ranting about her PS station and her chudaap to shut it down and those stories were fun to hear and talk about. 
She has helped this bastard get atleast some notes or atleast pics of Arushi's notebook so that I can atleast read something and go for exams, thanks for that help and you would need to do that for another whole year. ( No request its an order ) 

She's that female who loves to be adventurous and do chudaap be it jumping out of the wall or passing through the gate without signing in, she is a true stud :P . She hardly stays in campus, either she is in Bangalore for some genuine reasons or out enjoying Goa with friends and her cool Mom :) .

I know you would have been forced to hear my random chudaap attimes, thanks for bearing me and helping me out in whatever situations it be .

Btw, you in sari was the moment of my college life ! Lets make ENI hell for those cunt juniors and our batch mates who shall study and mug to get marks, lets kick their asses.

PS. This pic is awesome :) http://tinyurl.com/bpbhs4q :D

<p>So i met this girl. 
Who at first glance, i was like "Whoa. okay she has to be cool"
Who, after she realizes you're a foodie too, won't let go of you.
Who has a chronic burning hatred for the colour pink. leave alone pink aircraft.. :P
Who doesn't seem to give a crap about what security personnel think. :D
Whose where-to-hang-out what-to-do advice puts tour-guides to shame.
Whose knowledge of anime, i believe, surpasses the collective east-asian populus.
whose energy and quirky attitude somehow just radiates to everyone around her. :D
and finally, whose ability to smoothen out wrinkles is legendary. :)
And ladies and gentlemen.
*drum roll.
Kriti Garuda!!! *Game show music plays. :D
The first time i met Kriti was at aero's first meeting of the year.
She told me "You're that guy from the physics freshers aren't you? Ranjita's a good friend of mine".
And ever since then, i've been getting to know Kriti real well.
You can't find a better food buddy. it just isn't possible. She points me to the restraunt and i go and eat. that's how it works. :D. first aero outing, She took us to mama mia's and i couldn't help but down a pizza there. She showed me how to get around town and showed me where to go.
In the aero club, she pushed me to work to my fullest and believed in me when i made the occasional mistake busting a good plane or two
Whenever i'm bummed or disappointed with my work, she cheers me up and prods me into trying again and whenever i'm not feeling up to the task, drop a truckload of work on my head to make me practice. :D
She's not just been a great buddy in aero, but everywhere else too. :)
That meeting she let me take li8, to go finish some business, i still owe her for that. :P
and everything afterwards, is another story. :P
For not only being a great coord and a great senior, but also for being one of my really good friends, i'm happy that she'll be staying another year right here on campus. :D

Looking forward to our eating trip Kriti!!! :D

P.S. for all of you who will go the kala room from now on, the drawing on the wall is mine. sorry kriti i couldn't resist. :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-ganesh">Sundar Ganesh</a></p>
<p>Kriti you always have been probably the only girl in the whole hostel who plays good music, I remember shouting out song requests to you from Tara's room back in first year, good old days! And of course those extremely serious discussions regarding who is girly-er :D And also just to clarify once more, I don't watch Hannah Montana :P Wishing you lots of fun-filled success ahead! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>I knew you the first day I came to bits- the gal accompanying me as a late-comer..smart, funloving..but you proved out be an awsum friend..seriously from jumping down roofs to watching a telugu movie u translated for me, and listening to my endless talks..i really had a blast with you in first sem..!!  a lot has changed since then(Kriti emerging as the loved Shuriken :P) but just wanted to say that you were there with me during the major lows and highs in college..and no matter how days many days have passed since then..I ll always cherish the times we shared.. Keep rocking..!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tapsi-dubey">Tapsi Dubey</a></p>
<p>First day on campus and we found ourselves in the library lawns fighting over the size of your laptop's display. (:P) And even though we spent a hell lot of time together during the first sem, most and the best of bonding took place via GTalk a year later.

One of the smartest and most intelligent people I've come across (and I don't really appreciate anyone else's intelligence so easily :P) with great taste in food (Vegetarianism Rules, BTW :D) and music, I kind of envy you because of the amount of fun you have and hope some of your outgoing nature rubs off on me. :P I'm extremely proud of you (though I'm under-qualified for being so) for being the best Aero coordinator ever and even though you might think I stopped caring long back, it gives me a sense of personal fulfillment seeing the "heights" you've taken the club to. 

You are the one person who has always been there whenever I needed a friend and didn't have anyone else to go to, even when you weren't at your best yourself. I wish I could've been there and done the same for you too.  We've had countless fights and arguments, mostly because of the stupidest reasons, but never tired. I guess the best part is that we can openly pick up a fight and offend each other without worrying about any consequences, knowing nothing's ever gonna change :)

I don't think I could ever thank you enough for listening to me and bearing me for all this while (and in times to come) despite my being myself and I want you to know that it all meant a lot to me. It's great to have you as my best friend and I hope it stays that way for a long, long time. 

Here's to one of my oldest friends on campus! I love you for being who you are and I trust you to never change :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>First I used to call your shuri. Now it's Kriti. Earlier it was all TITAN talk and then we all (especially me) grew up from the hub talk. I remember Chait once showed me that fireball trick video. I still share it on DC :P You can become the DC chick legend you know. I am sure that we will continue to meet (especially because of Sood) :) So, I shall not say *goodbye* and all of that crap. Instead, I shall say, "Wassup? :)".<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-pant">Aniket Pant</a></p>

<p>Kriti's one of the coolest, most genuine and chilled out people I've met. She defines grunge and black tees and bungee jumping and pink floyd posters and self-constructed aeroplanes and all the other cool shit I can think of! With the way she redefined Titan and Aero-D, you know she's made of the tough stuff. She's made corridor life absolutely epic with her 24*7 blaring speakers (and subsequent 24*7 blaring Nirmala :P), loud 'discussions', and constant supply of amazing food. Her room reminds me of chocolates, head banging, airplane parts and black decor and is by far, my favourite place in the hostel! :D
From bungee-jumping girl to the rock n' roll girl to knowing that she goes way beyond all that, Kriti's an amazing person, one of the definite keepers. We've got so many holidays planned and things to look forward to, I know for sure that we'll do them all some day! 
Peace out. :P

<p>You, dear lady, are one of the most amazing people I've encountered throughout my college life. With your crazy persona and devil may care attitude, it's insane how you still manage to be such a darling to everyone. Fearless and free-spirited, you've inspired me many a time to just take the leap (even if it's just outside the college gates ;)) I love your room and i love your t-shirts! and your music and posters and yummy food (that your room keeps magically conjuring out of nowhere!). I see you around campus, Sunday shorts on, super cool paper plane in hand, and I think, 'wow, she's really living life to the fullest'.
Here's hoping I'm there to witness more of your adventures, first hand if I'm lucky!
Lots of love =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayeesha-khanna">Ayeesha Khanna</a></p>
<p>Yo! I remember at bogmalo taking my case for supporting chelsea! (still dont get it) One of the few girls (huh united really :D)who actually do follow football cm sports to some extent except the fact dat u support the wrong team :P An outgoing person with an ever-present smile on her face. I'm glad to know her, even though i met her fairly late on in my BITS life. From flying planes to riding bikes I have seen her do it all. You go girl !

<p>Haha! Arushi what ALL did she get from you?? <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>
<p>Kriti! I don't know how I can write about you or whatever time we have spent together. I guess we have been friends since ages haina! We both have seen each other through the best of the times and the worst of the times. Every semester that we have spent has been so much different. You are one of the most genuine people I have met. I think you are one of the people I have had most fun with. We both don't care a shit about the world and keep on embarrassing the people around us. Hehehe! Remember how Arushi used to get all worked up with us! We both have soo much in common. We both can be extremely lazy about doing anything on time and in general, never attending classes and missing tests when we know they will happen! and at the same time we have this enthusiasm and energy to do all the random chudaap! It is so much fun to hang around with you! You have been a great friend. Listened to my rona dhona, even though i know most of the times you din't have anything to say.hehe! You poor thing used to just listen and listen with this quizzical look on your face! I guess the most important part about being friends is just about being there and that you did everytime :) I love the fact that we both have this shitty routine so whenever I am bored I can just walk to your room at 1 at night and start talking. Damn this hostel would have been so boring without you. God, I can't forget that Ghanta prank we did at 4 in the morning! hehe. Stormfest was so much fun! That driver haha! kuch na kuch chudaap toh hona hi hota hai. Damn and we both trip at the same places. hehe. I somehow avoid falling most of the times though. You are this really innocent, simple chick who can never ever intentionally hurt anyone. I know that you are this sensitive and sweet person who is really helpful. I have never heard you say no to helping anyone. From food to the epic CP1 labs you have helped everyone for everything. hehe! It is rare to meet people who actually care and just be there when it matters and you are a gem! I don't think I can write everything I know about you.I love you Kriti ( there I said it! ) and I hope that we always remain in contact! Stay this lively, cute and this amazing person that you are! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>
