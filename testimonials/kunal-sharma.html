<p>Yoyo.. Pro bandha in Chemical and mathematics. I met him first on the balcony of SAC where we were watching seniors play. At first he looked a reserved kind of a guy and he still he is, but once he becomes your friend, he is such an awesome buddy to hangout with. Iski biwi lucky hogi bahut.. :D .. Tharki bandha hai aur mauka milte hi nazar marta hai (waise who doesnt :P)  I enjoy screwing him in CS one on one and we had a supercup tournament (best of 30 matches :D in our 1st yr) which i won by a whisker. All in all, hes a good gamer, Godlyk in FIFA, football (real life :P) and chess. All rounder hai with a gifted intelligence and good looks. Down to earth guy but sometimes he does show off :P but utna chalta hai.. We alongwith our grp hangout @ claudys and he loves bike trips. I am gonna miss these trips yaar :'( .. good thing is he stays in my homecity, so we will still continue to meet in future unless he decides to move his ass somewhere else :-/ .. I have to thank him too for sharing his ultimate playlist, whose songs i loved too much. Has a good taste in music and recommends good movies too. His hairstyle is interesting o.O .. I always tried to get that style..till date i am unsuccessful . _/\_ shampoo :D ... Aspires to do MBA from a top inst like IIM and I am very sure he will make it one day. I wish him all the best in CAT and all the success and happiness in life. I am badly gonna miss you dude :'(  .. these 10-12 testi lines are less to describe u Koonal !! _/\_ :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amrit-mann">Amrit Mann</a></p>
<p>Don’t go by his size he eats 3 times more than anybody on campus. He is a movie freak, the imdb site for us. Apart from it very intelligent and a real hard worker. He knows his priorities very well and act accordingly. A great footballer though lost quite a few times against me in footbowling :D. He has been a great caretaker for us at bogmalo visits. A great company to be with and I still remember the time we studied together or 1 could say when he taught me maths specially. An advice from the old man--- enjoy life a little more. Its been great three years with you and hope add many more. 
PS: “abe koi mast movie bata”:D

<p>Die hard football fan and pretty good player too. He is the first guy I’ve ever seen to refer to his fav team ( Chelsea ) as humlog and is the only guy who has a term ‘foru’ ( u can say fodu ) in his mail id. Njoyed a number of bike trips along with him but still can’t figure out his excitement ( as he always sit on the pillion seat and never drives it ). A great friend and the real dude of our club :D, who once, was so dedicated to studies that he literally stopped talking to anyone around. Possesses an efficient and great mind that could lead him to great many heights. Wish him a good luck for his future ……. And chu club foru, CAT bhi fod dena coz frankly chemical se kch nahi hona :) !!!!!!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>
<p>Meet koonal(fodu) :D as we all know him, have known this guy since 11th standard during our jee prep,but it was only in college that i really came to know this guy,this guy had quite an unlucky first sem ("tennis" ring any bells? :P ) but came all guns blazing since the 2nd sem in every department, be it studies,football,chess,or just random fun, masti and chudaap,oh and did i forget to mention that this guy is a total movie buff too :D,koonal is what you would call a true football fanatic and he has a knack of transferring that fanaticism to others which ofcourse includes me,we've shared countless great times together and this testimonial can hardly describe the fun and memories we have shared in these 3 best years of our lives, i'll never forget our countless claudy,bogmalo,bike trips(we've been to practically every beach and restaurant worth mentioning in goa :D) which we have been in and ofcourse who can forget the evening football in CP and central lawns, he is also what i may call a "mess partner" lol, 8 baje nahi ki dono ko bhook lag gayi aur chal pade mess :D, koonal has a lot of plus points starting from his brilliance in football and chess,a hardworking and "fodu" guy in academics,he is a guy who gives it all in whatever he is doing and is one of the best friends any guy can wish to have, bas Chelsea ko support karna chod de baki sab sahi hai :P , all the best and cheers to our friendship, may it last wherever we may be :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustoov-dutta">Koustoov Dutta</a></p>
<p>okay let me start with this guy's email id ( kunalforu@gmail.com) :D and rightly so... extremely hard working.. and a constant source of inspiration for me., great footballer , gr8 actor( as he used to say never saw him acting anyways except for his birthdays..) . Extremely motivated fellow u should see him during exams.. ( thoda li8 liya kar).. gtalk chats .. asking for movies ( and this guy never disappoints) .Its been a pleasure meeting you and the last three years spent with you were really awesome... wish you very best in your life.. and go get that IIM  seat ..

<p>Kunal Sharma aka Kachha Koonal is the world's biggest noob (or working hard to get that position :D ). Of the 1.5 years I have known him, he continues to reinforce that opinion every single day :P . I have heard tell that he is one heck of a footballer but I find it hard to believe that since 1) I have never seen him in action 2) He supports Chelsea. Apart from the above-mentioned qualities, one of the biggest positive aspects of this guy's character is that you can ALWAYS enjoy with him. I mean chemical CDC's were tolerable only because of our continuous repartee (which sometimes went on wayyy longer than they were supposed to and then it was just imbecilic insults by the end >.< ) Memorable moments include the time spent in FFO labs (I will ALWAYS remember the epic laughing fit I had because of the dumb expression on your face during viva and who can forget the K serial discussion :P ) Also he is one of the laziest person that I have ever seen apart from myself (his motto being "why do something today which you can do tomorrow") and I will disagree with the people above. This guy has shitty taste in movies and music (there I said it B| ) :P . And did I mention that he is a self - confessed "kamzor kali" :P i.e. he cannot even stand to put his fan on full even when other people are going out of their minds with the heat >.<. Now that I have sung all of his praises I possibly can, I will like to say that it was AWESOME to have you as a friend. We had loads of fun times (and will continue next sem too I suspect because of manjare :-\ ) and time spent with you would always be memorable. Now that you have dedicated yourself to becoming a full on manager with your CAT prep and all, I am sure you will achieve it since you can be a "foru" person whenever you want to. My best wishes on the journey ahead and of course GM.

<p>Kunalforu, I don’t know how to interpret this nick, but it sits apt in any way you do. He is not only a foru (master at acads) but always there “for u” as a loving and caring friend. The asli footballer, footbowler and futsaller, he is an energetic soul. A serious movie buff, he will have a new amazing movie to suggest everytime you confront him. Very hardworking, one will be amazed at his dedication during the exams, he is also fun to be around. “Most wanted” for stealing poker chips and slipping out stationary from neighbors. He is a good friend , and it’s a joy knowing him. Best of luck for your future bro… keep the hardwork going and next thing you know, you will be sitting in IIM remembering the fun we have had in the past three years… :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shakti-thakran">Shakti Thakran</a></p>
