<p>hmm, finally time to write something abt this guy. Lets see what can i say apart from workaholic, intelligent, robotic voice and sarcastic humor. Well there is much more to him than meets the eye. A completely awesome human being & a true friend. I can't imagine not being friends with this guy who is born with a pristine character and calibre to achieve things beyond abilities but still keeps his feet on the ground.
I really wish you good luck in life man and you shall be really missed after college. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>Couldn't have asked for a better neighbour. Panda's a great guy. I have always admired him, very knowledgeable with a firm determination, unwavering once the target is set. He has many great qualities that should be emulated by everybody. A great personality who creates his own luck and has always inspired me. He will reach great heights and I wish you the very best of luck!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>So finally, after a lot of postponement, I have decided to write a testimonial for this guy.  Kanishk is a guy who does nothing much, but about whom you can write on and on which is the reason for all the procrastination. He is hugely talented. One of the most intelligent guys I have met in my life. Bhagwan ne teen chaar logo ka dimaag is bande ko de diya hai. Studies very little for the amount of marks he gets, crams even lesser. One of the few guys who understands what he studies (though I doubt he wants to :P), because he has supernatural comprehending and grasping skills. He is a very practical and result oriented guy, and doesn't waver much, once he sets his target (though he takes a lot of time to set his target 8-|). When introduced to something new, he is pretty naive early on, but give him some time to think over it, and he will inevitably become better than you at it.... Bande me itni talent aur determination hai. Met him by chance near the ah3 common room during some random discussion, and since then, we have been friends. Since then, he has been one of the most helpful guys. I have lost count of the number of subjects he has taught me (some from scratch), the number of subjects in which my grades have improved by 2 or 4 points solely because of him (especially in 1st and 2nd year). So Kanishk, when you feel like shooting me for coming to your room and telling "Padha de kuch"/"Portion bata de"/"Kahaan se Padhna hai"/"Yeh kaise karte hai bata de" or for not helping you out even a bit with the CN/PLCC assignments, remember that tune hi meri aadat bigadi hai. Since first year, we have had almost all the same courses, same teachers (or at least same level of teachers :P), same classes, and also the same PS station. PS-I is one experience which I enjoyed a lot. Though the place was shitty, we guys managed to have a lot of fun... Sukant, Sangal (bed tod diya tera :D), Ajay, Haria, Anirvan (lol), Bhate, Seby, KB (:P) and the IGCAR interns :D. Thanks for allowing me to use your laptop more than you yourself used it (Tabhi se mere acads gutter me jaane shuru ho gaye :P). It was fun to watch you struggle for a change: with the language, with the food, without the spoon :P, with the people, with the projects and most importantly with the place itself :D. But still you did manage to face all the difficulties (not so difficult for me ob :P). These past 3 years have gone by very quickly, and the thought that there is only 1 more semester left before parting ways with rhino, kaiko, shabbar and you , makes me very sad. Abhi cg difference dekh ke toh we wont get the same PS-2 either :P. Anyways, it has been a lot of fun, these college years, and your ability to laugh at yourself made them more enjoyable. (kitna troll kiya hai tujhe, esp this sem... sardar, rajput, kunwar :D). Wish you all the best for your future. I can confidently say that whatever you choose to do in your life, you will easily ace it and will go on to be a very successful guy. Try and keep in touch :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-chandramouli">Varun Chandramouli</a></p>
