<h1 class="page-title">kushal agarwal</h1><p>He is my best *****(u know what) . He is very smart & intelligent. Always exams ke pehle bolega "Padha de yaar kuchh samaj nahi aa raha hai" & will top tests.  Prudent, diligent and witty, he is a pretty cool and relaxed guy and keeps his composure even in the most adverse times. I wish him best of luck for his future.. Be in touch..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>You always have that one friend in your group who ll never express anything. Kushal Agarwal, way too close to his family( although he will never accept it), a little too pragmatic and there's a little fat kid inside him who wants to do only one thing in life : EAT GOOD FOOD ( now where that GOOD FOOD is served ,nobody knows). He has these obsessive craze about certain things which change from time to time, his craze for extrememly stupid songs, extremely bitter tasting food, or sometimes some highly priced gadgets, then there is SMOKE HOT OFFICE ;)(After which he enjoys the best sleep in the world), and some random campus girls( impressed by their simplicity). You have to be patient with him , and once he opens up to you he is probably one of the funniest people to be with. Has a solution to all the problems in life.His weird expressions, the lingo that he uses and his weird dance - hilarious these things are. Our bogmalo talli party to his "daiyya daiyya" dance, from being a vegetarian to becoming a glutton who eats way too much non-veg, our road trip and that accident, annoying that ashram waiter "hemraj" millions of times,it has been hell of a party.I have been really lucky to have found a friend like him. Hai HARAAMI but is a true friend. He is destined to achieve something very big in life. Thank you for all the crazy moments.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aruj-srivastava">Aruj Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Pro_/\_aadmi hai bhai. Every eee eni guy would remember him being the topper of both of both of Mane's subjects in 3-1. It became routine, his name would be written on the board every time. Respect. Acads apart he is a chilled out dude, and you can never get enough of people like him. I admire him a lot for his greatness and pro-ness. You can easily connect with his electric personality and true to life attitude. He is very humble and friendly with everyone. He is bound to soar to great heights and I wish him the very best of luck!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
