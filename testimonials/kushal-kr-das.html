title: Kushal Kr Das

<h1 class="page-title">Kushal Kr Das</h1><p>I remember, I first met him, I guess during CP1 Lecture when I asked him for his notes. On the first look he reminded me of "Ronaldinho" (the thought still amuses me) and was surprised by the calmness on his face. But the next day I was stunned by his very lively, gigantic, and amusing, laugh. You can easily recognized him from the hostel gate, if hes laughing that "he's Kushal a.k.a kkd" Keeping all the fun apart, he's hard-working, reads a lot (which puts him in the category of intellectuals), has a good business sense (he has a business keeda for sure) and knows perfectly how good he is, and this is the very reason that separate him from others. Down to earth with a touch of mufat personality and overall a good and true friend. I wish him all the very best for the journey that he has chosen and I am very optimistic that he will do wonders in years to pass. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>Kushal Kr Das aka Chinki, he is the only one of his kind. He is fun loving and jolly. He cracks good jokes at right time, at right situations and in right manner. He is really down to earth and you can be yourself around him. He is a great friend and everyone enjoys his company. I wish him a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p> I met KKD while standing in the queue for room allotment. Just by seeing him i got a sigh of relief, as he was the only one with whom i could talk der the rest were ENTRA. KKD aka Chinki, ULFA has the most loudest laughter on campus. In the 1st sem he was very sincere, going to all classes, studing hard, not even listening to abusive language. As time passed the scenario was reversed. Chinki is hard working, has good marketing and business sense. Fun to hangout with. I am sure that a prosperous and illustrious future awaits him. Good luck!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Kushal aka KKD has been one of my closest friends here in BITS. He is one of the few guys you can discuss anything with and it has been a pleasure knowing him as a person.His knowledge of entrepreneurship is impressive and he has  great capacity and dynamism in handling the  responsibilities of various Departments and clubs. I can say without a doubt that he is going to be a great manager wherever he goes. Hail EBPMS!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>You are the most happiest person I have seen till now. In my first year you used to study a lot and used to be very serious. I thought you are very innocent and studious but slowly the scenario changed and you also became like me :P. We had great times together the night outs and waking up late in the morning and crying if we had missed any tests. But you are very good in communication skills and a very planned and disciplined person. I hope your start up reaches great heights and you achieve many more marvels in your life. Please never loose the smile how ever harsh the situations might be which makes you a lively person and people gets attracted by that. Never forget me buddy. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
