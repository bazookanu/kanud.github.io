<p>Laasya (I love to call her Lucia :P) is one of the sweetest persons I have ever known. Always ready to help others in any way she can, she is an epitome of kindness :) Very hard working and sincere, she definitely achieves whatever she sets her heart at. She values friendship a lot and easily mingles with people. An awesome dancer and singer, she brings life into any occasion. There can't be a moment you will feel bored around her. Another awesome gift she has is tying a saree !!  She can make anyone look the prettiest ever. Thanks for tying me saree for the farewell :)  I will miss the long chats and gossips we had till late in the night on various weird topics :P You will always have a special space in my heart. Love u lots. will miss u. Do keep in touch :)

<p>There's only so much lucky one can get :P, no pun intended. Two questions that popped into my mind when I saw Laasya: 1) "Lassi ? What ? Laalitya ? Whaaat ?  Oh, Laasya ? Ok, ok. First time I've heard that name. Sounds beautiful though"  2) "Hey who is that girl along with Laasya all the time ?" "Some Distinct voice: Showrya". :D. I haven't known Laasya since long, thanks Lucy Ma'm for giving us the opportunity to work(?) together. Laasya is always smiling, always around Showrya :P, and mostly gtalk-ing while she isn't studying. Takes work way too seriously :P  (you just cant make an 80 slide ppt with a 10 pg research paper in a day >.<) , heard from a reliable source that she ties sarees way too well. She is well known for breaking her spectacles, being utterly helpful (thanks for the burgers :D), and being a hardworker. She has a nice phone, that she doesn't give to others :P, and has the bad habit of not attending invited trips :(. She's never out of topics, and there were many pointless discussions we had on gtalk :D. Pro dancer, and now that Showrya mentioned, you are also going to (i) Sing (ii) Mimic profs :D. These things apart, you've always been fun to hang around with, and your smile is contagious so spread it :D. For the way you work hard, and for your Math intellect, I'll be surprised if IIMA doesn't take you ;). I've had a really good time with you, and you, for one, are one I'll always remember looking back at BITS. All the best for your future and stay in touch, lekunte feel avutharu ikkada janalu :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/goutham-harsha">Goutham Harsha</a></p>

<p>Well i arrived on the scene pretty late and on reading the testimonials above I realised that whatever I had in mind to write about laasya, some one or the other has already written about it... I wanted to write that she is a great Dancer(she should hav been in dance club,awesome dance performances for Ugadi)...A diehard shopaholic... very fashionable also... perhaps the fondest memory with her wud be shopping and bargaining at Calangute... very outgoing personality.... All d very best for a wonderful life ahead :D MImo<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>

<p>I don’t see her only lately….oops!!I forgot…it’s time for compre ryt??!!tat’s wat she does during compre…concentrate, work hard and transform into a “bookworm”…I still wonder how does she get sooo involved during exams…
May it be the exam season or non-exam season Lucky is a really friendly and funny girl…a good dancer I’ve seen during the last 2 Ugadi celebrations. It was always fun to have Laasya around, especially during IS classes, meetings. Hey do u remember the freshers party (during 3-1) we made a junior ask “who is ******* *******’s GF” and that you are some Elizabeth…it was fun :D.
Back to acads I’ve seen actual coding skills of lucky during COA….omg!!she was the one among very few who used to code the entire question…god knows how she did that.
It was on gtalk that we used to talk more than normal, the “song guess” game which v used to play on gtalk…haaa!!!tat was really entertaining…though she’s good at it…I used to win most of the times (becoz I GOOGLE sometyms :P :P ;) )…hav been missing that game since many days :(
Btw I just wanted to say that u’ve got really nice dressing sense…keep it up :) 
All the best…keep smiling as always :) and do stay in touch

<p>How can I forget this epic quote?.."A semaphore named OS online is preventing me to enter my critical section called enjoyment"_/\_ _/\_.. This 

speaks all about the creativity of this wonderful girl.. Luckyy!!.. A bubbly, cheerful, funloving girl and the possessor of a pool of talents(few of 

them hidden though :D).. Needless to say, she is an awesome dancer,an amazing painter and a crazy freak!!.. A very friendly person and a very 

very very down-to-earth lady.. She is elegant and carries herself with a lot of grace.. I love her dressing sense and her attitude towards life is 

just \m/.. The first time I met her, I was impressed by the way she spoke.Its just amazing to be in her company.. . She can make you forget all 

your sorrows and tensions.. The times with you shall always be cherished.. Be it the dance practices for Ugadi, or the unexpected HQ trip, or 

just TPing in our rooms... btw dont dare delete that folder :P.. The way you always find right occasions to tease me >.<.. Revenge shall definitely 

be taken in future :D..And yeah, forgot to mention, tries her hand in singing too(I heard u wen i ocasionally came to your corridor :P)..Coming to 

the seious part of her, you can see this side when exams approch.. She suddenly transforms into a completely studious girl who lives in library.. 

Thiugh she studies for a small amount of time, she studies with a lot of focus and determination.. A little more seriousness in life and prioitizing 

your priorities will take you to great heights.. We might have got different sets of friends now but you are definitely a special friend of mine 

and there is no one who can replace you in my life.. All the best for your future lucky :)).. Will definitely miss you if you will not stay in touch.. 

Signing off- Prani :).. P.S:Recap of our memories: Cheliya cheliya singaram... Errani kurradaanni gopala... bunny bunny... Jhamure velallo 

veerudalle vastadu.. dilammo dilammo.. okka magadu.. ata kavala pata kavala.. simha simha simha :D :D.. and finally lux papa lux papa
