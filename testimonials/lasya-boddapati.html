<h1 class="page-title">Lasya Boddapati</h1><p>BODDA ROY u r d craaaaaazzzzzzziest girl i've ever met!!!This girl is the junk food champ....never saw her eating nethin bt maggi n pasta for the whole f her first yr :P During first year i used to think of her as a very quiet n reserved person n many mite still agree with that, but wat most f u dnt know is dat u'll hardly ever meet a wilder girl!!(she actually thinks f shavin off her head!) I've shared some f my whackiest campus moments with her(u kno wat i mean lassi :D)She's my branch bud(yeah yeah..i know...distant cousins :P),exam time bud,fight bud(n i meand real hittin n stuff) and most f all one f my most speacial buds :) She's a very simple and an uncomplicated person,for a change. Poor chap listens to all my crappy stories even wen she doesnt even know the characters involved. She's nt d kinda girl who can giv u d expected pep talk, but is definitely d one who can pull u out f a rut with all f her stupid gimmicks :D 
Love u loaaaaadzzzzz lasya.....always wishing for ur best :)

<p>Its only been a semester since I got to know you well, but you're one of those people who make an everlasting impression, Lasya! Funny, intelligent and cute, she's an amazing friend, and I dare say we made a great team in the Analog lab (Great for us, not so much for them, for we left a pile of burnt stuff when we left, especially on the last day xD ) ! Those tiring afternoon hours were bearable only because of her. It's great knowing you, and  I wish you weren't going away next sem. Always stay in touch! All the very best to you :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>yo BoddAA... My Best ENI Buddy!!!! :-)  I am very lucky to have known this fun loving girl! Got to know her from 2-1. Had great time with her in MT and EIIT labs and lectures (esp. ENI CDC's, to worth mention Bacher's.. ;) ). She is very helpful, reliable, generous, humorous (and lot more... :)) and a very hard-working and dedicated girl once she sets up her mind on something (that late night eiit assignment :P) Will surely miss you.... Keep in touch... I'm sure u'll reach great heights in future... :-) Keep rocking \m/ <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neethu-bal-mallya">Neethu Bal Mallya</a></p>
<p>I really got to know lasya towards the end of 2-2(CAS :P), I really regret not getting to know you before that although she lives only two rooms away. Lasya isn’t someone you meet everyday, she has an incredible tolerance for drudgery of our ENI life! While the whole world cringes and cribs, lasya is in her room planning her work and working her plan. Add her fine execution and cool attitude to that, and we have a genius.  Lasya is one of her kind, very intelligent, very efficient and ever so modest!
If anyone can give all the nerds a run for their marks without being one, its her!
In my awe of Lasya I’m probably painting a bleak picture for you guys, but I know she cudnt be any less bland and boring.  She has a sense of humor that shuffles between child-like and insanity :D  Walk into her room.. life size posters, bunny hair bands, an array of accessories each one louder than the rest and not to mention her own maniacal self.   
She has no understanding of sarcasm. :| ask her to strangle u in a boring lecture and beware, she might take u literally. Heres to two eventful semesters, every pj we cracked in classes and pretended to be good at it, every cartoon we scribbled on the LT desks, every sweaty evening in the  gym and every one of the wretched assignments! I will miss you! How one can put a year of awesomeness in one paragraph is simply beyond me.

<p>lasya lasya  has a liitle world of her own...i swear she has come a long way from just being shut in her room in the beginning of (it was one of the biggest mysteries..."raaz 311 ka".. :P).The girl who was so shy to talk..th is now the biggest enterntainer of my life..,her crazy impromptu dance steps (to releive stress :P hers as well as of ppl watching her..:D),the best ballet performer_/\_ _/\_ this corridor would have seen and will ever..she is a lover,collector of weird things (yet somehow cute)..i really thankyou for being 2009A8PS379G nd by that i mean u saved me from ENI...it was god's plan to send u to live in front of ME!!!!..because god knew to live peacefully in this college or nywhere i'd need a dumpyard..( nd now i have one for the rest of my life :P) to just dump all my thoughts,anger,theories.etc nd u being such a PATIENT LISTENER have listened to me whine,blabber,shout even if more than half of it was in hindi nd not making sense to you.Most ppl dont knw this but lasya is a great artist, she excels in  this art of messing up her room in a few hours after she hersekf has finished cleaning it in hours and the calling it a PIG sty!!!!!!! jokes apart for me she is the best photographer whose camera is most of the full of my pictures....(but u owe me more..) she says iam very stubborn but i must say u are as stubborn as i am ... once u decide to do it or not do ..ahaan u wont budge!..we have  had so much fun together..remember anjuna market trip..will never forget the way we reached there, the king drama (the funny story u made with all those pics),ur sense of humour u coming up with unique nick names for all of us nd last but not the least ur famous phrases .."ITS yyyAaverage","burn mmmyyaax,bore myyax",dont go!!!!!!", "putuk zaara zaara dubuk maaeh" :P :P love u soooooooooo much nd one day we will surely go to dubai!!! :-* :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-jain">sakshi jain</a></p>
<p>Lasya . . she knows more English than telugu ... looking at her at first no one can believe her she is a telugu. Her accent n everything abt her sets her apart .. I hope we'll have more time together during our 4-2. Best of luck :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
