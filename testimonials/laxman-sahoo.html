title: Laxman Sahoo

<h1 class="page-title">Laxman Sahoo</h1><p>Laxman or lax as he is called, is an awesome sportsman. He excels at more sports than most people can barely play. He likes to call himself (quite justifiably) "mein champ hoon", or as we call him "champu". Nevertheless, he is the best football/futsal player that I have ever played with. Its just the simplicity and elegance of his touches that will make anyone fall in love with the beautiful sport that football is. Well, football/sports apart; he is extremely mature, humble, supportive, magnanimous and phattu :P. He is one of those rare people whom you can always count upon. Be it any hour of day or night, he surely will be there to help you should you ask him; well almost always unless he is snoring around for he happens to be a lazy-ass, full of sloth and sluggishness. However, I'm truly grateful for all your help during my stay in Chennai (for PS). A completely new city, foreign incomprehensible language, crapy acco at Meenambakam; it was thanks to you that I survived those couple of months and infact they turned out to be much more amusing and entertaining than I ever hoped they will be :D.

Here's a toast to the futsal/football matches, to the bog jaunts \m/, the awesome trip to Banglore (that insane ride in wonderla), to the fun times in Chennai, and to all the unforgettable moments and experiences shared over the past years. Cheers !!

P.S : There will always be time for a football/futsal match, or a drink and ;). Stay in touch :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
<p>L, L##@*, L@#%$&. Cant write all the names I have given you. Maybe Big M. A legend you are man. Like I said ,one of the few genuine guys I have met in this campus. A phodu of the highest regard. Superb in Football, Cricket, Badminton, Chess, TT, Fifa and what not. Just merely saying a sportsperson will be an insult. The only thing that bothers me is you habit of thinking that others are better than  you( especially acads). Dude you are a fucking 7P. Live like it. Keep in touch BC. Nahi tho Chennai aake peetunga. And you know how much I hate that place  :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
