All the very best chaitanya!!!Miss you and all yout trouble that you gave me (along with Zignas)  :)  .Dont forget to invite me to your marriage as you are going to be first guy in our gang to marry!!!!! and i do not want to miss the first marriage of our batch...  :P..All the best!!!!  :)  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>M.C.R  :D.He is very kind and generous.Every semester i  used to take textbooks from him.He's hard working and dedicated.More importantly,He's  the most  helpful senior i met in the college.He always says to address him by his name even though i am his junior.In one line he's like a brother to me :-D.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>“Muslim” is the word that rings a bell when I think abt him…hahha…well it’s no caste…it’s the name of the infamous MATHS-III teacher…..Chaitanya is the only person who attended all of his classes…tat too sitting in the 1st bench…god knows how did he bear tat teacher….apart from class hours, Machu(Chaitanya) is actually a close to friend tat teacher….may it be GF or marriage or nytng else,he discussed every random thing with him (weird :P)….no surprise he was “offered” a project by him…..well this part of testimonial will be never ending if I continue writing about Muslim.
Machu is the one of the 2 ppl I’ve seen in BITS who always occupies the 1st bench whatever class it myt be. He is famous for his pro photo shop skills in and outside IS, especially the last year IS shirt and spree-2012 tee designs _/\__/\_.  He has got a passion to learn everything properly, right from the basics.
Chaitu is also good at playing cricket and haaa the b’day bumps. No one in hostel would even dare to hit him…he goes totally crazy on anyone’s b’day and starts giving b’day bumps!!! I still remember the last time he I got them (it hurts :( ) . 
His testimonial cannot end without mentioning his helpful and friendly nature. He is the only person in whole of BITS (among BE/M.Sc) who is very close to ME ppl and his friendship with zignas reddy is the best one, selfless .
