<p>Cool character, charismatic demeanor, entertaining personality are a few words which best describe Gautham aka "Reddy". He is easily one of the coolest guy I've ever met on campus. He is a unique man who possesses this special ability of standing out of the crowd (which I only wish I had). His easy-go attitude towards life and calmness even in the face of adversities inspire many on campus, including me. I envy his awesome routine (imagine taking a morning jog even on the days of Compre) and I'm awestruck to see the way he maintains it. He had my word of my company to his jog, which I have been able to keep only on few occasions (remember??) :P. Times spent with you will always be etched in my memory, which I shall cherish forever. Come what may, be the way you are and never change. Wish you a great life ahead. Farewell and keep in touch!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>The guy who wakes up at 6 AM. Still does not go to classes. Respect. The only guy ever I guess to score Avg + 40 in Consys compre with a pre compre score <5 . Reddy the Don who does things in his own cool way. Whatever he does he remains happy and chilled. Have fun dude and keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
