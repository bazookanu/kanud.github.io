<h1 class="page-title">M S Sandeep</h1><p>A very kind and selfless person. Likes traveling and adventures. Always the first person to step up to the responsibility, a very able and ethical leader.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankeerth">Sankeerth</a></p>
<p>For almost 2 years, I just knew him as ‘the hostel rep’. Later on, we became better friends thanks to DoPY and EEE. I once remember finding myself in his room on the CAS exam morning, copying FFT diagrams! Sandeep is one of the most down-to-earth people I know. He has an amazing ability to take a vague idea from anyone, and just make it happen! Working with him for Quark 2012 was an awesome experience! If theres one thing you need to learn from Sandeep, it is how to be late, yet one time(his epic tssn seminar entrance is one such example :P ) and how to be lazy but work when it really matters! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Sandeep aka emes a very down to earth person i know. you scold him,you beat him all he says is "Jaffa" and nothing else. one of the best Chief for DoPy i witnessed managed things briliantly n yea a tharki too :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>i hardly remember the last time i called him with his name.the only name we call him-->"MnU".. for those who don't know,it means "management and utilities"guy who takes care about the hostel..i think he is the best ever hostel representative that our hostel or any other hostel had...i was surprised when he became the chief coordinator for department of photography..i almost thought"dafaq"..but, the way he changed the face of the whole department, HATS OFF to u sandy(though u r not a better photographer than me :P)..though he screwed up his cg in his second year with these things, he still maintains a decent amount of it..thats the type of dedication he has..i hope you wont let it go off from u..its one of your strengths..he does manage things very well..a little bit short tempered..gets frustrated easily :P..its been 3 wonderful years with u in the same corridor(not technically though)...i wish u all d best for your future..i wish u achieve greater heights in the path u choose to go...

Sandeep! 
Another good friend i found courtesy DoPy :)
Has an uncanny knack of irritating someone..Was really wondering how i m going to write good things about him like m supposed to over here when i have already lost count of how many times i have killed him in my imagination!:P 
Didnt know him much before third year and before he became the chief-co of doPy.
In fact he was the only one from the current team i had hardly exchanged a few sentences with and my first impression of him at that time was of someone who is a reliable and hard working guy who is good at managing things calmly.
The one year v worked together has only cemented that impression.
Truly a can-handle-anything kind of guy and he somehow gets things done, even if u think it won't be possible or there's not enough time, etc he somehow finds a way to surprise you by getting those things done and without losing his head and screaming at everyone in the vicinity even when under stress..which is quite an achievement!
Can say the most ridiculous things with a straight face and u cant help but smile when that happens no matter how lame it was :P
Has worked really hard for dopy, not just managing many things by himself but also getting us all to go on trips,(which was a really daunting task i should say :P ), seeing to it that everyone was having fun and so much more!
One of the few people i get so irritated with but still enjoy hanging out with and once he gets serious, u can't find a more reliable person.
Hope you make it big in life :), (do try not to shake a coke bottle everytym u open it w/o seeing who is around >.< and do throw things in dustbin! and try not to hit me on the head and last but not the least,even though v scold u so many times, we'll miss u a lot ! :))  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
<p>Well 'MS Sandeep' has transformed from our hostel rep in 2nd year to dopy chief co in 3rd year to placement team coordinator in 4th year. Started so many new things in our hostel in 2nd year making it so much more better than before. Then transformed dopy completely into an even more awesome department than before while being the chief co. And I'm so glad he is placement team coordi now as I know that in some way or the other he'll get all good companies for our placements next year. Extremely dedicated person and does his duties and work really well and that too with a lot of enthusiasm. Gets the job done and manages everyone and every situation so well that it will be a pleasure for anyone to work under him. He will be serious when necessary but the rest of the times he keeps every1 around him entertained with lots of jokes/funny talks or some other ways to bring laughter. A big fan of Mafia game :D A down-to-earth person and will help you in anything you ask him. In 1 word I'll just say this guy is awesome. Stay the way you are and looking forward to more fun times next year.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>

<p>SANDY! :D Sandeep is a stud. DoPY Chief, Placement, and what not. We tell him all our problems of fan light water even if he's not the hostel rep this time coz its just his job :P  I know Sandeep from Class 8, probably one of the  people I know the longest here. Me and him have had an epic journey this 1 year in the amount of EEE shit we had to take. In Sandy I found a great friend,someone to exactly share all my eee-hatred with. Good times await us in 4-2 Sandy. Best of luck with everything! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>He was the hostel rep of AH3 and the one that won many prizes for AH3 in Zephyr thanks to his encouragement and awesome Hostel video ! When he was made the chief co-coordinator of DoPy, I was first a bit annoyed and skeptical whether he deserved it. However the amount of dedication he has put through in his 3rd year surpasses that of most other people. He has been a very dedicated and responsible Chief Co-ordinator with a goal in mind at all times. Even exams haven't barred him from seeing his ultimate vision for the Department ( He still does well in all exams.) He constantly strives to maintain a good rapport with all his juniors. We were together for most part just before WAVES and there we came to know each other well .I must say he made my work extremely easy and WAVES wasn't such a big responsibility. He is a big opportunist which has helped him do awesome stuff under the posts that he took. He has a knack for working calmly under extremely tensed situations. This helps a lot if you are in a fix and he's nearby. A very respected figure (and almost the face of DoPy in 3rd year ), I marvel at the amount of fans he possesses. Maybe that's just part of his charisma. Thanks to Sandeep, I have been more aware of the campus than I ever was. He really knows what happens everywhere. He is also the sem 2 Placement Coordinator. With 3 big posts in hand, one can gauge the managerial skills of this guy. They just work. Thanks for all the times you kept up with my mood changes. Keep rocking !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>

<p>MSS (:P) aka Sandeep. He is the one who irritates people with his dumb and lame jokes and ideas.. Takes things for granted. Never in a hurry. Always procrastinates things till end. BUT he is very serious when required and gets work done somehow. And that what made him good hostel rep and DoPY chief, and now placement co-ordinator too. Also very dedicated and wants things to be perfect. He works till last minute to make it perfect (remember quark stop motion? U were trying till end just for that one small sound to match with the effect!) He has been most senti among us DoPY ppl in 3-2 and says ‘don’t be senti re.. I will be back in 4-2’ after every talk.. He always manages to keep calm in any situation, however tensed. Never saw him yelling at anyone... Be as you are. May you can improve the quality of your jokes :P All the best ! And yes, stop being senti...! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Sandy is an awesome, awesome guy! He's come a long way from being my alarm clock for much of the second year to now sleeping till 1PM irrespective of what day/year/month it is! :D He's been an amazing corridor mate and I'll really miss the times when all of us used to hang out and talk in our corridor(specially about how royally fucked we were in the next day's paper! :P) DOPY Chief Cordi and Hostel Rep, sandy has been brilliant at both! I've always had access to all the DOPY stuff before its released thanks to this guy! Thank you for an awesome 3 years Sandy! See you in 4-2! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
