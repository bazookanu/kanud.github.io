<h1 class="page-title">Maanit Mehra</h1><p>Maanit! He is one guy with whom I always have a helluva time! From the times of Sinhal's and us reciting RuMP, RuDP... phosphoglyceraldehyde... hexose and starch..we have evolved to DISCO DISCO MOON MOON... ! And we shall come up with more..
Maanit is a guy with whom one can never get bored. His energy is at another level itself. Always smiling and making people smile along.
He shall one day believe me how pineapple cake>>>chocolate cake (yes, you will!), We agree on most of the things and our tastes match often :P)
Yes, The Crab is pending! Jamming too..!!
So much to do and so little time,, but don't worry.. the parodies shall flow and so shall the these treats!... His sarcasm is worth mentioning and his wit too!
I always enjoy his company! He is a gem of a person and I shall always cherish my friendship with him!
Cheers, =)
P.S: Have you heard about the word?

<p> Maanit is one of the most unforgettable people I’ve ever met. He’s always brimming with enthusiasm and energy, even when he’s hobbling on a twisted ankle - he’s like Mr. Happy Man, so positive about everything and everyone around him.  I don’t know how he does it, and when I ask, of course I never get a straight answer!  He’s one of the best  and most trustworthy friends I have on campus, having known him for a year now, since the wonderful time the five of us had at Canopus during PS-1. He’s Eccentric (with a capital ‘E’, ladies and gentlemen!) a hard-worker, and passionate to the point of obsessing about the subjects he’s interested in, and I think we make a great team, working together.   Maanit never ceases to puzzle, always makes me laugh and is the nicest, kindest friend (when he’s not in Bird-mode, when I just want to clobber him over the head :P )  Thank you for being there throughout, for forsaking your afternoon naps to help with the project, for listening to my tirades and remember that we’ve still got tales to share, or rather, you do! I hope this will be a delightful friendship that will last a lifetime. Wish you all the best for the foggy unknown out there, mon ami! 
PS: (1) It was an LOP. (2) It was I who taught you Cadence, and (3) You gotta be online more often!

<p>Maanit Behraa!! Easily the 'Mummy' of our group :D! Whateva advises needed (or not) Maanit's always been there! :D Apart from all the lame jokes he cracks that have bested themselves at lameness over the years, He's been one hell of a friend. A friend who you can always look upto for some motherly care :D :P Seriously, our family at BITS wouldn't have been more complete but for this great guy! He always has to be 'Nice' to everyone :P but yeah, He gets senti when you get at his Natak Company :P Sometimes, have to put up with his random bakwaas( and logic too :D) But, it's been fun knowing him all along. Life was more colourful at BITS because of him. All those shared times and mindless wanderings have their own place in my college life now.... It's been a wonderful journey so far... Hope we cherish this bond of ours for many more years to come! Cheers! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurabh-nayak">Saurabh Nayak</a></p>
<p>Well where to begin about this NAUTANKI ! Yeah, for the obvious reasons of his prowess in Nautanki :D He is one of the persons you rarely come across. PS1 couldn't have been any better without you buddy. Countless are the number of times we've done God knows what to embarrass everyone at our station :D I still wonder about it, but he can be tickled wireless. Be it his head or toe or hair, he'd jump right off his ass even if you poke him a bit :D That's the 'Brahmastra' we all have against him :P He's the one who introduced me to the epic Peter Griffin and I've been a fan since :D Studies, drama, music and God knows what, this guy  excels in all of them. An awesome personality ! Will miss you a lot macha ! Rock it.

P.S. : Ssssssssss.....Aaaaaaahhhh.....SSsssssss.....AAhhhhhh :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Ok, I love the guy. To such an extent that I might settle down with him if he gives up on the war between managers and engineers. Ladies and laudas, Maanit is the guy for you.....ok, Maanit is the guy just for the second one. He was the person who gave Steve Jobs the idea about touch sensitivity. He is the guy who gives sleep a finger by saying "You dont exist, not for me atleast". But most important of all, he is one of those very few people on this campus whom I can count on. The best thing that has brought us this close is his frankness about everything, be it bad and be it good, he always has his reasons. In the words of Amitabh, he eats, drinks, shits, sleeps, speaks, wears, rubs, shags, and sucks EEE. But its the passion that he has for it that makes him practical. And our instances of gayism is something that has set a new benchmark in campus. Dude, the reason cameras are always there is cuse they want to document it. Kamasutra is old stuff. We are the new fabs re :P 
The only guy who can give any competition to my PJs, thanxs for everything behnchod! Campus would have been different without you. Love you for eternity and the next eternity :)

<p>Beware: Investing in Maanit is subject to emotional risk, please read the offer document carefully before befriending! I've really dreaded having to write this testimonial, hence saved it for the last. With Maanit, there is just so much, SO Much to write. This incessantly laughing, persistently ticklish and constantly moronic freak has easily got to be one of my best frnds on campus, though we havent got to spent much time this sem. Dont worry, being neighbours, we'll make up for it next sem. And the most ironic thing is that my first impression of Maanit was: "Man, I've got to stay away from this one, he seems evil". How times have changed. Be it for a morning jog or a midnight story, Maanit's been a great companion for almost 3 years. Your terrific decision making will be missed forever, right from your laptops with screwed up keyboards and no graphic cards, to your laptop bag that doesnt fit your laptop, to your "Android" phone that well lets say is best used as a camera. All the gay moments (oops, lets shush about this), all the violent moments, the bezt barty moments, the moments of sharing secrets, to moments of toil for CIMA and CLEO are strongly etched in my memory. Just wish you were on the F&P team as well. Hate you for the simulated drowning that you performed on me and all the messages of mine you read out in your cheap laughter and all the times you've made fun of my skin colour. But all the cheap-assness aside, Maanit is an asli padhaku, the original bada aadmi, one for whom the av always lies at av+20 and for whom coming second is never an option. Click a picture with this guy today because I promise you he's gonna be a superstar one day. (Dont forget us, ok). Hope you find love soon and not go after your seasonal firstie fetishes. Cheers. (Dont need to wish you luck, you've already got too much of it. And dont worry your next love wont be stolen by someone else, third time lucky hopefully!).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
