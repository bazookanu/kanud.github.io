<h1 class="page-title">Mallika Desai</h1><p>People always say, "No one is Perfect". But if you meet Mallika, then you will definitely bet against this perception. She is smart, intelligent, beautiful, attractive, kind and not to forget, the topper of our batch. In a nutshell, she has everything that makes someone perfect. 
With all the qualities she posesses, she could have easily been the queen of the world. But you will wonder how down to earth she is.
She will make you feel good about yourself with her presence, she will show you the way to live life carefree, and she will always care for others, here others means every living and nonliving thing in the world.
So she might not be the queen of the world, but she is definitely the queen of everyone's heart who befriended her. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bibhu-ashis-jena">Bibhu Ashis Jena</a></p>
<p>not easy to explain...but i'll try hmmmmm....bahut sochna pad raha hai yaar ki aisa kya accha likhu (just kidding yaar)
She is sweet, simple and caring girl. What i like most is her helping nature not only in case of her friends only but also for unknowns. Not to forget she is the topper of our class. I have done so many projects with her. She is intelligent, smart and brainy. She is the coolest girl i have ever met. She got a bad habit of finding good things in everyone. I have never seen her being angry or bitching about anyone. She is different from other girls. If u r saying something bad to her still she will smile..she got a beautiful smile..thats why she keeps it always on her face...This line will explain more "wo hai hi nahi is duniya ki". May god bless her...all the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankush-khurana">Ankush Khurana</a></p>
