<h1 class="page-title">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</h1><p>When you talk about sincerity, hard work and dedication, its his name that pops into my mind first. The way how he managed the challenging posts of Treasurer and Parishod Operation Head simultaneously with such commitment is an inspiration to many. Being the Treasurer of Nirmaan, he has done a wonderful job in bringing about a structure and professionalism to Nirmaan's account transactions. He is very helpful, supportive and considerate and puts a lot of thought into planning things out. He is always ready to explain any situation from the beginning again and again even when asked about a minute detail. :) He is always very patient and never have I seen him get angry!
Sometimes he takes things a bit too seriously and gets tensed over little things. (Remember the time that we spent trying to figure out from where we got an extra one rupee in Nirmaan Account, or the time just before you spoke in ACM ...or my favourite, how freaked out you were when a Central committee member disconnected your call ). 

Deepak, I consider myself fortunate to have a good friend like you! I am sure you'll have a great life ahead and will achieve all your dreams and ambitions :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
<p>One of the very decent and genuine guys on campus. This guy defines simplicity and the humble and kind nature of his is just amazing. Just the way he talks to you is an example of it. Very serious when it comes to work, and we all know how great he has been for nirmaan. It was truly great to have known you mate. All the best for everything. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
