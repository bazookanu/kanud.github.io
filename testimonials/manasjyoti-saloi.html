<h1 class="page-title">Manasjyoti Saloi</h1><p>Manas....Known throughout the campus for his infamous Tamatar News and his antics in the DC  main chat and also his black bangles back in 1st year :P...One of the litest guys i've ever known...Got to know him the first time we went to Miramar way back in 1-1...Have huge amount of respect for him as we have the same taste in comedy and apart from me one of the few guys who likes both South Park and Family Guy(Though never liked his taste in music :P ... too much 'Rock n Rolly' for my taste).One of a kind Guy and i have always loved to fight with him about football.A fun guy to hang out with and one of the coolest dude in the campus...All the best for your future endeavors ... Keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sriram-iyer">Sriram Iyer</a></p>
<p>Mj has been multifaceted for me. Same state. Same PS. Same NgoSphere. Same last bench in class. Or better no class. Has been a tremendous experience. He is extraordinarily dynamic, well-planned and creative. His blog was and is probably the only unique attempt in campus in actual satire. Brilliant in actuality while dormant (or should I say not-showing-off) in academics like me. But one thing I don't understand about him: why the hell does he still support Liverpool?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kushal-kr-das">Kushal Kr Das</a></p>
<p>manas or MJ as he likes to be called :P has his own way of doing things . Also called "Average Baba " for his nightouts before exams & mysteriously getting & guessing the averages correctly. But the outside appearance of lazy guy falls apart when you see the hard work he puts in topics of his interest (management stuff mostly :D). Hope you do well in the future & be in touch.   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-palasgaonkar">Vishal Palasgaonkar</a></p>

<p>Met this awesome guy through MT2 labs .. One heck of a person.. He is true to his nature, extremely creative, simple, positive, not at all pretentious .... He's the person who is really street-smart .. the satire he writes on his blog has been one of my most favourite reads.. the simple and uncomplicated nature of this guy is reflected in everything he does.... And to sum it up all, he's a really good friend...  Best of luck for your life ahead dude. Enjoy :)

<p>MJ :D , one of the funniest people i kno . His  brilliant idea of tamatar news , equally backed by awesome content was epic . You should continue writing . I just love cracking chinki jokes on him , while he reciprocates Gujjar ones on me ( told u bc m an Agarwal :D ) . One of the most raw people I know . Be the same MJ throughout , the system sucks , dont change for it \m/ , ATB for life <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>
<p>Manas :) - Our friendship started with Fifa rivalry in 1--2 and den it grew stronger and stronger ( with some minor problems :D ). 3 years , same corridor and  same chudaap :) . Almost every one has written about Tamatar News , so no point of writing about that. But Manas is a very helpful person who likes to live n his own world of Gothic and dunno what chudaap :| Be it NgoSphere , Election campaigns , Jog Falls trip and so many trips ,  it is great to have a friend like him . One more thing bout him which most of the people don't know is , he is a true INFOSYS admirer and would give up any job to join INFOSYS :)  Anyways , we have a very special friendship and I know we will continue it forever :) All he best for life ahead and specially CAT/GMAT exams . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swapnil-saurav">Swapnil Saurav</a></p>

<p>Yaar MJ ke sath I haven’t been veryyy close, but itna hai, frst sem se kahi na kahi bas ache dost hain! We don’t have anything in common, bas I think shayad ek who P N Deepak ki class thi, sab peeche baithkar gaaliya dete the sath mein. And bas uske baad, aise hi, here and there, and during Waves organisation. What I really like is his honesty. He might like something, not like something, he’ll tell u on your face, no chudaap.. other than that, an awesome guy, one of the first friends that I have from the north east. Oh and the man behind Tamatar news. A prolific writer, can beat the shit out of anyone with his sarcasm, and above all, a goof friend! Best of luck for life, u have a long way to go! Bas touch mein rehna sirjee! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>
<p>Manas--The one-stop shop for all sorts of advices on all sorts of things.."encyclopedia" serves the purpose of his description in one word..But I'd prefer to use the term "knowledgable"(ask him why..LOL).He's full of talents..his blog's just one of them all....he's a budding entrepreneur...a philosopher...a PRO designer(recently revealed) and donno how long he's gonna make this list to go throughout his life..He'll surely have a bright future..though what he chooses can't be predicted by normal people like us..I just hope and wish that he has a good life too while crossing the limits of a normal life....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saswat-baruah">Saswat Baruah</a></p>
<p>Manas , MJ , Black Messiah ..... one of the most famous personality of our batch. The guy really lives life on his own terms and I really admire u for dat. First came to know him during the heady days of Fifa 10 ...really miss those times . Fellow LFC supporter, budding entrepreneur and of course, the master blogger . The guy is truly one of a kind (ob in a good way :P). Look forward to meeting u again on Anfield someday.
P.S. Whatever any asshole may say, ur site was truly kickass.
