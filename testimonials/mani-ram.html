<p>Mani Dewd ! We've been partners in almost everything we've done. 2 projects plus IMA Lab. Best lab partner ever. Thanks for writing the reports. Real good at manipulations and we always looked for shortcuts. That's what made him such an awesome lab partner. Real pro at Physics. This sem has really phodufied all the cdc's. Very helpful during exams and solves everyone's doubts patiently. We bullshitted our way out of most vivas and seminars and it was great fun doing that. Plus he's also a Mime actor par excellence. Listening to him try to speak in Hindi is a treat. Enjoyed this year a lot with this guy.Hoping next year to be better. Lab partners for life bitch !

<p>Mani!!! the man without who my BITS life wud never have been the same (this line is kinda bcuming cliche.. but here it is just unavoidable). Hardworking, so damn intelligent, an awesome friend. From waking me up in the morning, advising me about things, calling me to mess to almost everything my parents did when i was @ home!! He is serious when it comes to serious matters and always jovial otherwise.. The most responsible guy in our gang, he never forgot to remind us even the smallest things, from registering for sumthin to booking train tickets back home. Coz f him all the 3 years in BITS, i never had to give my mess option myself.. 3 years he did it for me!! :'(... Working in the mime club, coz of people like him, we knew club was in safe hands (:P). Inspite of being an awesome actor he saw to it that everyone got a role in the mimes and always suggested someone else for a role. Mime club owes you big time! I will never forget the looong nights sitting and chatting in different secret locations on campus (highly confidential), the craziest fights, getting ragged in our first year (!) and ragging juniors in our second year (!), the road trips, the outings, the near death experience on the bike trip (:P), the trekkings, the making fun of ppl in and outta our gang, the PS1 memories, the pranks we did on people (again in and outta f our gang), the crazy dances singing v***** **i***, the 'mani classes' before exam, the same bajaj fan we bought together (:P) , shouting out names in mess (:P), getting better in badminton starting as an amateur, getting caught by police in 4 different states (:P) (and in Goa itself 2 times by same guy) and emptying your pocket for them, the bird-watching (yes we are very interested in birds) and the list that never ends!! However we have decided to get job in Bangalore and stay in 1 appartment.... and also the 'living on a countryside' after we're 40.. so i hope (REALLY! REALLY!) that this dus not end here!! You will reach great heights.. u dont need my best of luck for that! Will miss him next sem! ROCK ON! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charly-poul">Charly Poul</a></p>
<p>Damn u Charly , u could have left something out,now i have almost nothing left to say. 
Whoever had the pleasure of knowing this 'BITCH' will agree with that he is indeed 
Mr Awsuuuum. One of the more mature guys in our bunch :P  . He was our AAOC tutor for the whole 3rd year and at the same time he was the reason why i missed my every single EG lecture in 1st year. Excels at whatever he does,be it studies , getting caught by the police,bird watching ,being linked to random girls,making fun of me ...the list is practically endless. Whenever i have ever got into trouble he was always there to bail me out. A fellow badminton enthusiast( ;D) . Other than all this he was one of the main members of the mime club and a great actor. The heartthrob of a lot  (by a lot i mean just three XD ) of girls on campus.A one of a kind playboy.  A god when it comes to physics ,hes has been acing his CDC's throughout 3rd year. He has been taking care of the finances of our gang since the beginning,from settling the infinite internal debt  loops, collecting money to pay off the seniors (BTW good luck with that :P) and booking our train tickets.He was like our very own private DOFAM  all these years.Will never forget all the great times we had all these years-the road trips, the badminton games,make fun of kollam sessions,making fun of me sessions,the near death experiences, being chased by bulls, bribing the cops, all the late nights in bogmalo,the long drives etc etc etc. And i still have an entire sem to rock with this 'BITCH' as corridor mates in CH1. I wish him all the best for his future. ROCK ON BITCH :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>Mani Ram is the best dude to come from the village of Kollam in Kerala which was unheard of until he broke the barriers and burst out of it. And he is record holder in the Guinness book for being the first person to have natural socks in his legs and an open highway running through his head :P But jokes apart this guy is one of the most intelligent guys I've ever come across. When he says he has studied something, you can be sure that he has understood each and every aspect of it. And unlike other nerds , he still finds time to work hard for the mime club, play badminton and just generally enjoy life. A true mallu at heart, he always volunteers to be the one to handle any mallu related activity in campus and is serious and responsible at the right times. And also he is literally a pure brahmin unlike me and has never fallen pray for our continuous attempts to spoil it which is something to respect. So if any girl is reading this , then I present before you The Mr.Mani Ram P, the boyfriend that you will regret not having. Don't wait more and contact him as he already has many to choose from.

PS: never sit behind him on a scooter as he apparently doesn't see curves on the road :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>If Mallus were a Campus, Mani would be our CSA, with the powers of president, vice-president, treasurer and gen-sec. (www.manitimes.co.in :D :P) . The first fellow bitsian i met (who was not from my school).We started bonding right in between the train journey from Kerala to bits for the first  time ever. Things began to swirl up when i heard he was a fellow Mohanlal fan (but mind u, bitch turned after 2 years and now he is a stupid Mammooty fan).
Mani is too good to be true. The most responsible guy in our bunch, giving mess options to carrying out all the finances. He is like a father to Charly (:D) . He is fun-loving and suggests unbelievable ways of having fun. He does not enjoy the pleasures ;-) of life, but always accompanies us while we are, be it in Johns or Claudis or even in PK's room. Conversation is always alive when Mani is around, be it about his 3 hot chicks or about Kollam, he always brushes each and every comment aside with a graceful smile. An extremely intelligent and focused guy, he knows what he is doing all the time. He thinks twice before he acts and always proves as a valuable guide to character. He is a role model for all the bitsians. An extremely multi-talented guy, Mani is known for his proness in Physics, his exponential improvement in badminton, and his amazing concentration. 
All our moments together are worth cherishing , the famous ****** ****** dance, the long nite outs, the walks, the NC’s, the random mongi musings, the haunting of the haunts, and the pranks we pulled together (Prasaadddd :D) .A fellow mimer, a great actor with an ability to have any expression on his face, he was the safe shell of the mimers, everyone looked up at him when there was any crysis to be resolved….and LO! It would be resolved. 
The most commendable time with Mani is at kalpakkam. Those 70 days at PS were awesome. The tea shops, the snack buffets, the beach sessions, the Pondicherry incident,every single moment was worth living at PS.
This guy has got it all, right from being able to be caught by police, to the hardwork to success….
Id like to conclude with a code fragment from mani++
If (number==palindrome)
{
printf(%d,number);
}
U rock.  Mani==\m/ :D

<p>A perfect Bitsian.....Be it sports,academics,miming... or music(mridangam !!).. he excels in everything.I gt 2 knw him quite well durin my 2nd year.The guy's self control is amazing. You wud see him playin around until the last 1 or 2 days fr the xam nd then he immerses in studies fr hours without fallin fr any distractions. And finally when the result arrives ,he has topped the xam. !! Nt nly in academics.. he has never fell fr our attempts in gettin him drunk .:D(pakka Brahmin _/\_). Mani is a boon fr mime club.He ws the source fr many of the slapstick comedies mime club has ever shown. Apart frm a brilliant actor he ws also involved in managin the club along wid sikhil..He always considered fr others feelings. Whenever sumone (im nt sayin me.. :P) had an idea,they wud immediately discuss dat wid mani nd if he din like it..he wud frankly but humbly reject it without hurtin anyone's feelings.He ensured everyone in the club ws active durin mime meetings. He cares a lot fr his frnds.Whenever sumone is nt feelin well,he wud b der  with them .. helping them in all ways like buyin medicines fr him,gettin him food frm mess..etc.He is a also a good music composer.the number of compositions he made are so many dat.. he frgt most of them.its a huge loss fr the world of musiq. He is the favourite fr most of the faculty.(esp ..Kole :D).I hav never seen such a guy with so many talents nd still is sooo kind nd humble. I wish i ws like him.The only thing at which im at his level is CP2.. :D.We had lots nd lots of experiences like ...our first bike outing,bunkin MOS classes,hilarious mime meetings,fight at shahi,bayroad nd watertank discussions.. etc. I wont be missing him much next sem coz we r gonna be room neighbours. We ll surely rock next sem.!!!  Mani.. u are a true gem in our gang...  Ur the one i respect the most.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-">Rahul </a></p>

<p>Mani Mr.Mime. He is one of the most funniest guys I have ever seen who is always happy and makes others happy too.You are one of my favorite mallus in our campus. I would like to thank S.K because of whom I met you firstly. He is the best actor(seriously) not only on stage the even outside always doing some crazy stuff. Coming to studies he is one of the gods of physics too. Hoping the best for your future. You rock man(i)..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sachin-irukula">sachin irukula</a></p>
<p>He is a very lazy guy....but phodu in studies \m/. If you ask him, did u study? His reply will be " Yea somewht but i dont remember anything" n he will be one of the toppers when the result comes out......BITCH!! :P. Very fun loving guy, got to know him coz of physics and is fun to hang out with him....have enjoyed all the time spent with you....be it the outings or class fun :D. Very helpful guy, have always helped me happily with all my physics doubts always. One more thing, when he is free, all he does is, flirts with girls....either on gtalk or on fb :P. Cheers man....will miss u lot!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Maaani get up...this is how I have started each day in campus for the last three years :P. Mani is a dear friend. I am so used to wake him up everyday that even during vacations i reach my phone in the morning to wake him up >.<  . He is one of the most funniest guys i have ever met. His dedication towards the activities of Mime club is legendary. He is a true scholar, and is a topper in most of the subjects . His intelligence combined with his charming handsome appearance make him irresistible to all the girls in campus :D. Without him helping me in physics cdcs i wud have flunked surely. He finds my jokes very annoying and tries to kill me everytime i crack one  :P .  Looking forward to an awesome year (EEE :P). Keep smiling :)

<p>Mani is a ‘Phone-menon’!He is probably the mostly helpful friends I’ve ever had. Every time someone in the group has a problem, he’s there being the hero, helping you out. He may have a receding hairline and incredibly tiny feet (much tinier than mine!) but he’s very mature and responsible. BRILLIANT. He’s such an efficient time manager. He roams around with 5p’s and 6p’s and still manages to keep his cgpa well above 8.Wastes no time. The physics God and the playboy of the campus. He’s been such an amazing friend to me. Had some great times together. When i first met you in the ragging session, the midnight strolls, the outings, the trekking, Chennai , controlling our drunk friends, the rapes and hangouts in sikhil’s room, the videos, the pranks, the kollam jokes etc. etc.Has been an amazing 3 years! Man going to miss you like hell. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>The first time i met this guy was on the train while travelling to campus. He didn't speak much and struck me as a reserved type of guy. Prob one of the least true things about him, he is anything but reserved. Hardworking and above all humble one of the best friends a person can have. Mr. responsible does nearly evthg from booking tickets for the entire mallus to filling in their mess options. About 20 odd people wouldnt be able to go back home if it wasn't for him. Damn intelligent and really helps a lot in studies(makes all the tough things seem lika a piece of cake :P). Can't forget the 60 days spent at PS, one of the most memorable times. From bribing a policeman to surviving near death experiences this dude has done it all. He has his fair share of admirers both on and off campus :D Though u probably wont need it all the best for ur future n keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ben-thomas">Ben Thomas</a></p>
<p>Mani... Not much that i know of you due to the absence of interaction in the first two years but i can still say that you are a very kind and generous person. Intelligent at the same time and your hard working attitude just adds a great deal to it.. Really knowledgeable and willing to help. It was great knowing you buddy.. All the best for your future and may you get all what you want and deserve... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Mani. You bitch. You made me work so much but I still love doing it. I remember our SOP days and how we were so stuck with everything. And suddenly, it all happened. He is one guy, who suddenly comes out during the tests and just busts every subject to the core. You are a pro at that. No one can deny it. You have a very eccentric smile which just spreads out. You are just so very intelligent and mimey. Its an experience to be with you. Best of luck....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>Ramani as i like to call him, or Phani Ram as every1 likes to call him, :D this guy is the most responsible and self-controlled guy in campus that I know of. The fucker finds time for EVERYTHING!! let it be studies or teaching others or sports or fun with frnds or mime stuff or mallu community stuff or ANYTHING! and he works a 110% for each and everything and also manages to ace his acads. Whenever any1 has any problem with anything, am sure the first thing they do wud be to ask mani for help, coz he knows what to do! :) Very very very helpful, and i cant stress that enuf! The DOFAM of our group :D You are the captain of our crew :D Seriously are u from this planet or sumwer else? Coz i think every1 gets this doubt whenever they see ur leg :P Those natural socks are amazing :D He is the only guy I know who hates it when the wind blows in his face. :D Brushes off every pun about him and his hair or socks or 'Kollam' (:P) or his vegetarianism with a smiling face. The playboy of the campus u cud say, having had his fair share of chicks (1 off-campus and 2 on-campus) :P :D V got one more sem together, which, no need to mention, will be rocking! Dont know what'll happen in the future. All I can say is keep in touch and i'll try the same :) ATB!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-v-chandran">Aswin V Chandran</a></p>
<p>Mani, the phodu, hilarious Mr. Mime. I've known u since 1st year, a wonderful company to hang out with.
