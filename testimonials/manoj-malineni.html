<p>Manoj aka Woz is one of the friends i have made in this campus whose memories I will cherish for years to come. He is cool headed and a Out of the Box thinker. He is very determined and always takes well informed decisions. As the President of CSA for 2011-12 it was great time working with him and one thing that I have learnt from him is to think BIG!! He is a hardcore Indian at heart who loves using Apple products. Hope future brings success to you and may we remain friends for life!! Cheers!!

<p>Manoj, My buooyyy ... U made my Third year the best ever. It was Awesome working with you.  :P
i have known u frm my frst year. Had my frst Ragging sesion in Ah6 with u. Then our friendship just grew with the trips and working together in DOFAM . Never in my wildest dreams thought that i would end up in CSA that too with 'WOZ '. And after that the rest is history, My 3rd year was like a fun Roller Coaster, thanks to u for involving everyone in all the CSA actions , and backing my Sensible stands.Ur sensibility in thinking will take you miles ahead for sure. All those Night outs, Trips ,  and Ice and Spice adventures :P and the other serious stuff like meetings and decisions will be something that i will cherish for life, Apple freak, Good friend , very very very down to earth are just some words to describe you.  Hope our friendship keeps growing like this . Stay in touch. CHEERS :) :) :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshith-rao-yethapu">Akshith Rao Yethapu</a></p>
<p>A tall quiet chap in shorts with a table tennis bat in hand asking if he could join to play with us in SAC - the first impression of this man which whom I have spend some memorial time together. Those awesome times where we used to talk about apple or general things where awesome, the endless outings we had together with other friends shall be cherish for life. I remember him helping me in whatever I asked him for, the group studies which got you marks and not me was fun. The transformation in him from being a guy who talked very less and to the point to Woz, the owner of Woodstock to Prez, the true leader who just knew how things worked and did take the apt right decisions to now a kind person what he is. One good quality I love of his is he cant be misguided nor can he be influenced, he does what he likes and hardly cares of what people think, keep it and dont lose this quality. Thanks for those rides you gave in Pune helping us out. 
I hope you stay the same person who you were, you are a big man I just wish you that you remain the Big man you are. 
I could write a hell lot of things where we had fun, truly one of the kind hearted and genuine people I have met in my life.

PS. Reflect back on your life and try to be the same person you were when you came to campus and Apple is losing shares.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>

<p>Mr President a.k.a Manoj ...one of the friends on campus i made whom i will always be missed.... The Apple freak .... Got all apple products...  He has some obsession with Apple... 

So i met you first time during elections.... during 2-1 ... The calm guy in CSA , the silent person... out of the box thinker ... .always ready with some plan or some new idea.... Good at executing them... Working with you for almost one year has been awesome... Enjoyed it a lot.... Great dedication you have....

All the fun we had during outings ... and all other sessions ... Especially the Waves ones... remember that day when we had that meeting after waves in not so sober condition...  All the fun we had with all the other friends every night during fest .. and not to forget the conference room sessions .... all of it is memorable ....
Can't explain it all on text ... bt all i can say it has been fun being around you ... thank you so much for being such a good friend...

Hope that you have a very great future ahead... all my best wishes... always stay in touch... and plan more of those random bogmalo trips :P
