<h1 class="page-title">Manpreet Singh Kainth</h1><p>Sardaaaaaar !! :fire in the hole: My pagadi chuddy buddy :D The GOD of programming, graphics, game dev, CS, AOE(to some extent :D) and what not ! A very cool headed and intelligent person. Meme lover.  Does what he loves and does it brilliantly. He never fails to amuse us, though innocently many times. While people while away their time listening to Floyd and Led Zep, this guy does the same but to sounds like 'Contra Level 1 Boss music', "Contra Final boss stage sound track" et al. He defines the passion for gaming and game development. Respect for you sardaar. Tease him, taunt him as much as you want, not a single f**k is given by him :D I guess no one could ever get angry with him. Sardaaar ! I'm glad I came across you in BITS and we shall have a great year of studyin CS (both of em) together. Cheers to the best sardaar in BITS _/\_<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Manpreetteee.... He is a very unique character to be frank. His love for coding has made him do several unwanted deeds (like studying in the first year to get a cgpa high enough to get CS as his dual). Ever since that he seems to have taken lite, much to the respite for people like us ;). He is a great guy to hang out with though. I won't say he has a great sense of humor but he has some sense of humor nevertheless :P. We do have one more year left and am sure that we will have more memories and time to spend with each other. All the best for ur internship mate. All the very best for everything else too (like passing the AMS compre :P )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Ladoo! y0! So here is this great guy whom I haven't even met but I from whatever interaction we have had through the gaming and DC portholes, I can say he is a nice person who is awesome in UT but gets a little shaky when facing me. Well, yes, keep practicing. He is a polite, helping and funny person. And his meme humour is masssst. I will miss him after he goes away from this campus, not only because I will lose a good UT competitor who made it worth the time spent playing UT, with him trying to beat me[ ;) ], but also because he is such a great guy and great guys like him are especially hard to come across. :) May you succeed in whatever you wish to do. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ateendra-sharma">Ateendra Sharma</a></p>
<p>Sgt Laddoo Singh aka sardaara aka physics pro,my partner in crime (both of us are proud of our respective disciplines :P:D) what would life be without him!!when acads were becoming torture and mech was sucking my blood like anything this guy was the one whom i could cry with,we shared the same sentiments about our branches.He is a god level game programmer and even better gamer.The rapport we both shared all these years is something i would cherish all my life.He is such a humble guy who is always ready to stand beside his friends and values friendship above everything.The late night borderlands ,left for dead ,cs and ut coop were simply awesome and in a way he has become my best gaming companion.I am so proud to have such a friend like him.Tanks sardar for that unparalleled and unique sense of humor you have most of which goes over my head :P :D .I would miss those 'chapets' on my back as a consequence of teasing and irritating him.All the best for your future sardaara!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
