<h1 class="page-title">mayank masrin</h1><p>No wonder he was "THE ONE" in 10,000s that could swim well...a diversified multicultural postmodern deconstructionist,he is an old school,but his inner child is outward bound,a rude dude,but the real deal,lean and mean a guy you have never seen. Cocked, locked and ready to rock. 
Rough tough and hard to bluff,takes it slow,goes with the flow,ride with the tide,got glide in his stride and party hearty because party time is boozing time.
Man spent awsmest time with you...campus se bhaag ke ni8out pe jana...that escape :P when we reached the radhaswami satsang and managed to come back in..the long walk along the majorda beach,coffee at 2am \m/,singing and dancing,numerous bogmalo trips...remember that gori babe(martha)..??
and singing "yeh jo halka halka".."in aankhon ki masti.." etc etc the ni8 with chair in lift and fire extinguisher in middle of no-where..all the benches disassembled..climbing on street lights..getting on top of Bdome..u name it and we hav done it...kuch bhi nai chora..tightest escapes from main gate..
senti conversations....amazing amazing amazing...you complete it man...AE DOST HUMNE TARAK-E-TALUKH KE BAWAJUT MEHSUS KI HAI TERI JARURAT KABHI KABHI....PAR DIL TO MERA UDAAS HAI NASIR....RAAWANGI KI RUSWAI ZAHIR KARTA HAI... :) ...best of luck man...will miss you... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejendar-singh">Tejendar Singh</a></p>
