<p>They say his first words when he was a child were, "DNS server conflict." Bas computer pakda do. Kuchh toh keede karta rahega. He is the one guy who hasn't confined himself to just what's happening on campus. You have to admire him for his passion. He'll sit for hours, learning something new, from somewhere on the internet. (And then during his free time, he turns to Dragon Age Origins, choosing attires for his female character)

Probably the best thing about him is his fucked up body clock. So he'd always be up n ready for the NC, after a 5 hour sleep in the evening. I guess the greatest conversations we had was over chicken schezwan noodles in the NC. Roz naaye ideas. Startup kholte hain. Robot banate hain. Chhod li8 lete hain. Aaj paise tu bharde.

I'm sure one day he'll be out there, doing something big. Bas tab bula dena mujhe. Till then, keep in touch man.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>PROOO! hes almost robotic! but with a huge heart. ready to help when ever needed. the way he sits, talks, walks.. is the  most amusing part about him.:D proest coder in the campus and his gtalk stats were a source of info for all coding enthusiasts! :P 
my AOE inspiration! keep it up dude! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>

<p>Mayank Singh . This guy is a legend, I shit you not , the rightfull title of 'geek god' belongs to this man. Perhaps better known as Marcus. A-list coders (facebook and google material we are talking about here btw ), IMHO one of the best i have ever known in BPGC, insane raw talent. I admire and envy his 'one-track' no nonsense approach. True gentleman. This guy will take on a challenge and surmount it in a jIffy. He redefines down to earth sheer awesomeness, that has been but my downfall . I make no bones about the fact that this dude is my inspiration and one I always have looked upto and admired in my campus life. Marcus is pro at coding pwns most of us  at aoe :D , loves gaming and is an awesome human being. Calm, composed and reserved , albeit  less known among the 90210 and Gossip GIrl crowd , but a legend among the rest. I can but, not  forget the intense and dedicated discussions we had on those all nighters on dc and waiting for the mess to serve breakfast in the early hours of the morning. He will overcome whatever challenge you throw at him in the most adverse of situations,were we mere mortals would hang our boots and retire. Working but scantly, with him in the past has been but an honour a few are fortune to receive. His passion and dedication is one I strive to emulate and hope I get the chance to work with him sometime in the future . Mayank KUDOS, leave the dent on the world that is rightfully yours to make.

<p><User> der ?

<User> wassup?
<His>gm
<User> wtf ?
<His> (abbey cs on )( abbey aoe on ) ( abbey dota on ) (abbey code chef on ) ...
Get a life man :P

Ok ! To start this creature is unique and crafted to sheer perfection. People talk all about his coding and his gaming but his guy is WEIRD, the way he talks, behaves and his walk ! 

None know when he sleeps when he eats or what he does bcoz its all behind those closed doors which open only when he is playing with loads of people storming his room to have glimpse of this monster play.

A guy who lives on his own principles doesn't a fuck about whats happening about in this campus unless its related to his work or his interests (gaming, music, food). His playlist which I never understood but its considered to be vivid and awesome to those fans of his.
And now Anime, people need stuff from Pantene or Sunsilk but this chap is happy with this anime ( piece of shit for me ) .

Now serious, a true gentleman who believes in learning and experimenting . Has been a great inspiration and a true teacher at times . Any doubt ask him he shall you to Google and learn on yourself and if you dont get it he will make sure you understand it well.

Those heated debates and discussions about random things on the net or new products and then thinking of new ideas and its implementation, his views are always to the point and helped me make my decisions.

Dont seeing Anime, work on your walk , improve coding ( Code chef rank dekh apna salle ) and make us proud ! 

I see one day in future that tiny village in Bihar renamed as Marcusganj :)

<p>Mayank Singh was the most unique person in our odd & peculiar corridor. We must have spoken like 2 times and that would have consisted mostly of nods :P But he has helped me fix my laptop a few times and for that I'm grateful to him. He is an awesome guy and I wish him all the best for future :) Silent Conventionalism rocks :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Marcus, Foodie, pro coder , great friend, alien in some ways. The guy is a genius, even as we would idle away our time in the junior years marcus would either be learning something new. This guy had a weird body cycle!!! When all would be tired of a days work marcus would rise up fresh from his slumber. NC me breakfast karta hai ye banda. What really sets him a class apart is his humbleness and his determination.Isko koi kaam de do and this guy would sit on it for hours until he completes that, He's really a great friend, gives you honest opinions. Marcus be it gan me saaath me av- laana ya nc me discussions, i have had some great times with you, Hope we stay in touch ..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>Yoyo Marcus!! , Mayank aka Marcus Aurelius is truly one of the geek gods of campus, A GSoCer and one of the best coders on campus, i also hear hes ambidextrous.(codes on his pc with his right and laptop on his left, simultaneously). I'll always remember knocking on his door (for food, ob!) and him shouting "DND, DND".  Although hes mostly asleep when i am awake, we've still had a lot of fun may it be AoE, cs , dota or him doing my SoP ! Marcus  is a true genius in when it comes to coding, and his hunger for knowledge is unparalleled, given the number of online courses hes currently pursuing! Hes also enroute to securing his 2nd GSoC and another 2.5 lacs (o.O). Although, his more pressing target seems to be destroying Chhupia in AoE :D.  Cheers to this amazing person!! Have a great life in Silicon Valley!

<p>In first 2 years we never met as he used to sleep at the time when i used to wake up in the morning. One day, when I and Chhapia got stuck in debugging a C program, we called this person and he wrote some code found the mistake in 2 mins. I also remember him as a pro in Matlab. Ob PRO coder. But I started knowing him better because of AOE. PRO in it as well. I can't forget so many AOE games that I have played with him and the AOE "gang". This guy hosted and played AOE at 10am when his exam was at 12 noon. The most special incident with him was at the Doodhsagar waterfall ( :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Mayank, one of the first friends I made on campus. He was on a soul-searching mission in the Aerodynamics club when I first got close to him. I have always been in utter awe of this person. From day one, Mayank was absolutely sure what he wanted to do in college (I'm not talking about mere CDCs). The way he grew from a coding inclined firstie to the GOD he is now, is stuff worthy of legends. The sheer genius that this guy is, is best described by the things he has done with a computer, from GSoC to AoE, from Foodkhoj to Arkham Asylam _/\_.
Extremely humble and grounded, one can always find his door open for a friend who wants to have a look at the latest game (being played at the proest level) or for one who wants to make sense of abstract computer jargon. He has a totally in-human internal clock and an authoritarian command over his sleep cycle, being able to sleep and be awake at anytime for however long. Here is an extremely passionate person who has got things figured out. All the best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
