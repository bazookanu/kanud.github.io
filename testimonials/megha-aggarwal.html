<p>Megha! I met her in the first week on campus. She was in IS back then. Then she was in Chemistry. Then she came to Eco! :P
I am glad she did.! Megha has a really infectious laugh that can set people laughing more! It has always been a pleasure having her in my group for eco assignments or POM (Cadbury Schweppes :D ) She is a very sweet girl and very helpful. Always bubbly and has a really kind nature!
I wish you all the very best in your future endevours! Keep Smiling! :) : ) :)

<p>Well, my first impression of Megha was that she is a 9ptr prick :P But now I know I was wrong about the prick part. Megha is more like a sis to me. She is a really nice and responsible person.
She is simple and not at all pretentious. I think she is the only girl I know who is good at computers in practice. I mean she REALLY knows how to use MS Word etc unlike others who might be getting 10/10 in Comp Sci but dunno how to Copy/Paste in Excel!

She is a really good and diligent as a team mate. It is rare to find a person who can work in a team and be responsible for his/her duties, but Megha has it. She also knows how to take work from people when they are not working in a group assignment :P And that is a really important quality of a leader. She comes up with good and practical ideas and always welcomes new ideas. She is helpful, sometimes naughty and a great friend.
I wish her a good and successful future.  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Megha is so bubbly and energetic.. i love the way she laughs. you should never tell her to whisper in class..(u knw why ;) ) . Megha is an awesome singer  (remember TRW :P ), but she doesn't sing in public. :(  . Shes really fun to talk to.  Megha, i have never seen somebody laugh so innocently... take it with u wherever u go :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saumya-gupta">Saumya Gupta</a></p>
<p>What do I say, I find myself in unknown territory. It's tough for me to write anything about you without seeming biased. But trust me,, I won't let this chance slip away, my once chance to get back at you ( DEVILISH LAUGHTER muhahahaha). Now megha aggarwal is not that type of girl who you will make a very strong impression on you when you first meet her, she generally works her way in. I got to know you in the summers after 1-2 when i was totally jobless and had nothing else to do but strike up random chat with random people on facebook :P. I don't exactly recall what we discussed but one thing was very apparent , she was not the usual romance struck keeda from next door. Gradually I came to know you better on campus when we used to have epic long gtalk chat sessions though we hardly ever met. My first meets with you were during net-teach. Useless as that session was it atleast gave me a new friend in you. We used to fight over all the things all the time, totally opposite we were and i used to LOVE pulling your leg( still do).  In the days to come as friendship grew stronger, we used to share problems , crib about things together...... the rest as they say is history. I am in awe of your determination, the effort you put into something , be it acads or anything else. I also love the way we differ over things and how you try to hold your own when we argue. Your're a staunch feminist , you're quite lazy when it comes to things other than acads :P. You might want to show that you are all mature and grown up but there's a kid inside you that still wants's to sleep till 12 in the mornings, play out in the rain, watch movies all night with your friends. You might be not very tall in height but your certainly are my Everest <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>Megha is one of the most determined, hardworking and persistent person on campus. Humble and dedicated, she has her own way of tackling problems. The best thing about her is that even if she is very pissed off with you ....she won't yell at you. she would talk calmly and softly as she always does...dunno how you have so much patience! I have also heard you play the guitar nicely but sadly haven't got a chance to listen to you....hope it comes soon :) Having you in our group during the assignments was like a real treasure for us....you definitely know how to manage a team nicely! and you have got an infectious smile....so keep that smile on and stay in touch! Wish u all d beshhhhtttt :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>

<p>megha! the first thing to notice about her is her innocence and her super bubbly nature! though a kid at heart...she is very hardworking wen it comes to acads... a kind of person who has a very logical and practical approach to things...we would be sitting together in Patnaik's class and trying hard to make sense of whats going on...(failing miserably in our attempts and so having talks about random things via chits ! :P)...
very helpful and a great teammate...i so glad ur ID no. is just after mine... :)
be as innocent as u r...n keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruthi-srinivas">Shruthi Srinivas</a></p>
<p> Everytime I think of Megha I am reminded of her laugh.. no one can laugh like her. My first day on campus was the day I was introduced to this girl with a sweet, shrill voice, particularly endearing laughter and a characteristic amiable tone of speech. We soon grew to be very good friends. If there is anything in particular that drew me closer to her was her habit of laughing her head off at every silly thing. She is childlike in every respect, her curiosity in trying out everything new, her fun-loving attitude, her nature of whining over little things, petty fights and arguments over nothing at all, her excitement in celebrating her friends’ birthdays and her resentment about not getting to celebrate her own birthday in campus :P… that’s Megha… She has a great sense of humor.. she always makes me laugh, no matter how my mood is. I don’t remember how many times in the hostel and in the mess we used to end up in hysterics because of her jokes :D… She is artistic, has a beautiful voice and is the best maggi-maker in our hostel:). It’s wonderful to have known you Megha and it’s been a pleasure to have spent all those crazy times in the hostel and the mess together:):):D.

<p>Megha….I really don’t know where to begin with…I mean there are just so many things that I can recollect from the past three years of our friendship. To begin with I realized that it was quite a coincidence that we happened to cross paths at NIT Surat during our AIEEE counseling and then finally meet here at BITS-Goa. She is a really nice person to talk to…one who will always listen to you and also at the same time point out if something is wrong. She has a sweet voice not only when she sings but also when she talks. Sometimes, this sweet voice turns into shrill screams (especially during horror movie sessions :P)Anyway, it’s always fun watching horror movies with you…one can actually get the feel of the movie. That doesn’t mean the other movie sessions weren’t fun…they have always been and will always continue to be. Megha is basically a fun loving person. Be it going out with friends, watching movies or even playing games on her laptop she always likes to have fun. Whenever you see her, she will always be in a very cheerful mood and I bet that can make any person’s day :) She is a huge huge fan of vampire fiction in any form tv series, movies or even novels for that matter (She was the one who suggested that I watch VD and since then I have been so addicted to it). We both started the trend of making people dance to peppy item numbers on their birthdays and I will have to admit that it makes the birthdays more fun :) I am glad to have been one of those friends to whom she can come and confide her deepest thoughts in confidence. As friends we have had our share of misunderstandings and arguments on petty issues, generally, I am the one to lose my temper but her sweetness does not allow my anger to last for long. Things go back to normal in a very short period of time. I still remember how much Megha used to watch chick flicks in our first and second year. You name any such movie and she will have watched it already. Half the time it would be her suggesting me movies to watch to kill the boredom. She is a fan of reading novels and when I say that I mean that if you give her any book and if she finds it interesting enough she can actually finish it overnight.  Megha can also write very well. Although she doesn’t write much I don’t know why. Tapping foot to the weirdest of songs on the dance floor during DJ nights have been some of the most awesome moments of my life in BITS. Her laughter is sooo distinct…One can easily figure out without actually seeing that the girl would be Megha…This girl just loves gaming…maybe not as much as most of the guys on this campus but enough to be addicted to her laptop or mobile phones playing games every now and then. I always knew Megha could impress anyone with her sweet and charming yet a little kiddish personality. Quite gladly, I would bet this is what got her to change her relationship status from single to committed. Megha and I never really had too many classes in common but that still doesn’t stop me from saying that she is very intelligent. Inspite of all the fun that she has, she continues to maintain her good grades which is very impressive and one thing to learn. She is one of those friends who has always given me company when I wished to have alcoholic drinks and by now I am sure she must have tried most of them :P ummm….she also has nice long hair with which I just love experimenting new hairstyles…Lucky for me that some of her clothes fit me quite well…so I can actually borrow them on occasions. Our trip to Colaba last summers will always remain unforgettable to me. Three years in Mumbai and that was the first time we actually went out somewhere together. It was so much fun shopping that day and then taking a stroll by the Gateway of India….Going to Taj only because of the uncontrollable craving for chocolate pastries…and then boarding the wrong train at the end of the day…haha…it was total fun. I just wish we could have some more such trips. Well…to sum it all up she has been a beautiful friend and a wonderful company in this memorable journey at BITS which is coming to an end very soon. I hope that we continue to bond just the way we have all these years even in future. Wish you all the very best for your future. Always stay the same and hope you achieve great success in life :) Love Sneha<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>God jab mujhe thoda dimag dena jab bhul gaye, to he created an angel and sent you in my life..one of my best friends, cant imagine what would my life have been without you ! (u know how stupid I am ;). Sabse pehle to, we both have the same name and I totally love it!apna hi naam itni baar din mein bolti hin (:P:P:P)..(ekdum awesome h !!) .The amount of concern that she has for other people and her wisdom are commendable. (mere hisse ki sab isse chali gayi).. That is what made it easy for me to open up to her. Innocent like a kid, will necer think twice before trying something new… when you need her, you cannot find a person wiser than her.  Her room is half mine..ya to main yam era kuch saman iske room poar hoga. (:P). Always perky and full of life..She is sincere, hardworking, smart,intelligent ,that everyone knows , but the best quality about her is that she never tries to fake a feeling, never does a thing that she does not like. I admire her attitude and respect her for that..i wish main bhi aisi hoti! Never change that attitude.. I will miss those times when she would come running to tell me something and start by saying’ pata h,pata h, pata h’, the paneer  fights we had  or the never ending chatting sessions.. without even saying a word, she always knew when I am depressed and has been there for  me…can confide her with any secret...friend hi nahi, guide bhi h meri! She can never wisper!! (:P :P)  …the ‘kuch nahin’ queen ( you know why ;);) )……has the cutest smile and most beautiful voice I have ever heard.. ! ( and dare you lose it ever! ) . She is a person from whom I have learnt a lot( kya hoga mera baad mein ??? )..best maggi-maker, nobody can beat her in that!! Tere liye to jitna likhun utna kam h…you know me inside out and you know I will need your advices hamesha.!  I hope next semester bhi hum bahut masti karen…thanks for everything..my best wishes are always there with you!!! Love you loads… :-*   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>

If our hostels also had balcony na.. we would ve had a gala time with ours :P :P She has the best laugh and it always makes you laugh..woh jab earphones lagake friends aur sarabhai dekhte waqt hasti hai!!!.. :D ..her room door is always ajar n being  the first one when u enter the corridor, her room (with all the mess  :P ) is our den!..before starting any incident.. her tagline “tumko pata hai…” and an electric smile… bilkul bachchi hai.. koi beach se soap bubbles banane ka toy le aai thi.. but still when in trouble and u need an advice.. megha is the person to go to.. uska “Freddie” her teddy.. we spent a whole afternoon in a soft toy store playing with nearly all the toys.. making a drama play out of them before getting Freddie…the shopkeeper was like “kitne saal ke ho tum??!!!” and when we are watching a horror movie she is my scream buddy :P :D when our whole hostel comes to knw wat we are upto.. n not to mention all the mostly- failed rescue attempts ( with the ZP :P) its been a funride :D I am not gonna leave u just yet.. next sem.. poori masti (I knw u have CS cdcs.. we will manage!)
