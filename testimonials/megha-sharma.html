<h1 class="page-title">Megha Sharma</h1><p>Before even i had met her, she had form a strong impression on me of being a very studios and dedicated girl. After knowing her, i realized that she is a very hardworking girl. She is consistent in academics and a steady 9p. She deserves to be at the top of the batch. She always has a smile about her and is always in a jolly mood. Talking with her always lifts your spirits high even if you had a bad day. I think she is the tallest girl in our batch. She is the perfect combination of beauty-with-the-brains. She is a genuine, honest and down-to-earth person. I hope that her attitude takes her places. I wish her luck so that she can fulfill her desires and reach the pinnacle of success. Good Luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Shes tall!!! that was my first impression of her. Before I came to know her I knew her through the general opinion that she is a phodu at acads and a pretty shy keeps her t herself person. It was not entirely wrong though. :P .She is a phodu but shes's not at tall nerdy, She might come across as shy but once you get to know her she's real fun to be with. She's also pretty strong for a girl( you can take that as a compliment megha :P). She is a foodie, always at mongi munching at something.  She is very very hardworking( see her notes!!!,( always relied on her for opre notes). A good friend and a very nice down to earth person. Its been a pleasure knowing you. Good luck for the future :)

<p>Megha is a really sweet girl, she is hard working, very calm, beautiful and intelligent.
She is very helpful and if you need an assignment to copy from then she is the girl :P
Always keep that beautiful smile alive. I wish you a great life ahead.

<p>I met Megha when she was in our MT2 group. She is a very hard working, down to earth girl. She is bright and peppy, always ready to chat. She was the manager of our MT2 group, always distributing the readings, reports, printing graphs, co-ordinating activities. I liked listening to her 'Rajasthan ki kahaniyaa'<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>We also had PoE class together, and she aced it!! All the best for your future!! May you have a succesfull and bright future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>She is the first person of this campus whom I met. Unlikely, her first impression on me was that she is not at all studious, but... She is always ready to help, enjoys talking, fun loving, hard working, and many more qualities are there. I would say be happy, enjoy life, and stay in touch. College will miss you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>

<p> My first day on campus was filled with all people with glowing faces smiling and basking in the glory of having cleared BITSAT and making it here to one of the BITS campuses. Quite conspicuously Kinu was not one of them. This tall slender female was standing right behind me in the queue when we were waiting for our hostel allotments. Although she was in BITS she wasn’t happy which I later figured out because she preferred the Pilani campus more than Goa campus. Since that day I had thought it out that it’s ok, I will ensure the fact that she never regrets coming to Goa campus over Pilani. I think, now at the end of three years I have been quite successful at ensuring that. Quite coincidentally we both got slid up to Chemical Engineering in our fifth iteration and since then nothing could stop us from bonding as friends. We started having our classes common since the second sem and I must admit that she is a very hard working girl….Don’t mistake her to be nerdy, nah!!! She isn’t so at all…although she attends all classes and does well in the exams…it’s just that she is very sincere and dedicated to what she does and is very focused on one thing at a time. Although she was pretty confused until last sem about her career options but now that she has made up her mind I don’t think there will be any looking back for her and nothing can stop her from getting what she wants…In one word she is very determined. Hanging out with her has been so much fun…first to Palolem, then to arambol in the second year…unfortunately she wasn’t there for the Colva trip we all friends made together in 2-2 after t1 because by then she had changed her social status from being single to committed ? But never mind we have had short trips if not long to places like Panjim, Vasco, Bogmalo (which we quite frequently visit) and each of these trips have been so much fun with you….She too is a fan of shopping like most of the others in our circle and it never happens that we go to a place and not purchase atleast one thing…Oh n when it comes to food somewhere…she is quite a foodie…now when I say foodie it doesn’t mean that she hogs on them like some glutton but instead she appreciates good food and drinks too at times ;) She just loves to eat paneer….serve it to her in any form anywhere (possibly except in the Jain food form) and she will eat it up all by herself… I mean she can go crazy about paneer. ? Umm….i must say that one thing about her is that she can never say something onto somone’s face which is quite opposite a nature to that of mine….this sometimes works in her favor while at other times possibly against her….but I think she should adopt this quality as soon as she can in life coz the world out there is harsh and it becomes necessary as a girl to speak up to the problems faced. How can I forget the awesome movie nights we had watching horror and thriller films together along with Megha and Disha…We both were the only ones who used to keep our calm as the rest screamed at the top of their voices….and then we needed something light to watch and for me her room was always there, it being opposite to mine, to go and crash into after the sessions. We have had some awesome time gossiping about the most random things on campus, be it boyfriends to people’s dressing senses, we talked about it all…the DJ nites were fun too when both of us take to the floor dancing our way through the night….I will especially not forget the DJ nite of last waves sadly that was the last WAVES we had together. Having stayed with me for the past three years she has started comprehending a lot of my language Bengali and now if I speak in Bengali quite evidently she understands what I mean to say. Two years we have spent together as a part of the Chemical Engineering department loving few teachers and hating a few others. The classes are totally fun only becz Kinu has been there with me all the time. Now this sem I haven’t attended many classes while she has attended almost all so basically I use her help to understand most of the stuffs and she never says a no to it. She is one of the friends who is very supportive of what I do and knowing the fact that I like to live life on my own terms, she never has a problem with that. The best part about her is that she readily accepts people for who they are and knowing me inside out by now I am glad that she has accepted me in my way. These three years in BITS have been so memorable a journey with her and that includes the two years in the Chemical department. Now that college is coming to an end, with me going in the first semester, our time is coming to an end too but that definitely doesn’t mean the end of our friendship…nah!!! The seeds of friendship were sown in the first year and they have almost grown into a tree….the last part that remains is nurturing this tree appropriately and I am sure she knows the best way to do it. Therefore, I hope that in whichever part of the world we both reside in we can keep in touch forever. I hope to stay updated with everything that goes on in ur life and I assure u the same from my side as well. Wish you all the best for your future…there’s a long way to go before we all can rest….I know the rest of the journey ahead in life will not be easy but I sincerely hope that you will be able to go through with it quite easily and come out with flying colors. Wish you all the success in life and hope to see u at the peak of your career soon. Lots of love ?

<p>Hellozzz kinu aka megha aka me!! Hum dono ki destiny kitni similar similar hai naa (dono megha, dono 8 numbri, dono paneer ke die-hard fans!! :P :P ) Kinu was one of my first friends in campus, one of the really shy ones who take time to open up wid u, (in fact mera pehle sentence uske liye yahi tha: “U don’t speak much, do u??” :P :P) Really tall nd really brainy,  soft spoken nd sincere, sundar, susheel, gana bhi thoda bohot aata hi hai (:P)…all in all, ekdum perfect “bahu” ka combo!! :P :P She’s one of those amazing people who will sit patiently and listen to your problems no matter for how long you keep on going. But she won’t be that patient if you disagree with her on something (:P). Pata nahi engineering kyun karne aayi hai?? Aaram se doctor ban sakti thi.. koi bhi bimari ho, sardi, khasi ya jhukaam, bas kinu ke paas jao, medicine mil jaayegi, nhi to prescription to mil hi jaayegi, jo ki almost always is more accurate than even the med c doctors.  A huge lizard fan (:P), kinu itna respect deti hai use ki jab vo room mein aa jaye to khud room chod deti hai :P. Kinu..pls thoda jaldi khana seekh le naa…(nhi to date par tera BF wait hi karta reh jaayega :P)  aur thodi si kam senti ho jaa (vaise I’m not the right person to tell u this, but still :P). There are so many great moments we shared together… kitni saari planning ke baad pehle cocktail :D, all those horror movies and vampire diaries marathons, beach trips, ghnato baith ke chit chat karna, mess mein disha ke paneer ka batwara and all the other funny things we have done together (u know what ;) ;) ). I don’t know how I’ll get used to not having that around me when you won’t be there.. idiot, tu kyun shift ho gayi eco se chemical mein?? Nhi to hamari saari claases saath mein hoti plus baad mein ek hi company mein job bhi le lete…mast life hoti… koi nhi, humne aise bhi bohot maze kiye. Ek hi company mein nhi to kya, I hope hum dono Bangalore mein hi settle ho jaayein. Har weekend party hogi phir!!  :D :D.. love u lots..have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-aggarwal">Megha Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>There are some people who are just so funny that you enjoy listening to them when they talk. Some people are such good listeners that you enjoy talking to them. Kinu is both. She is such a good listener, that she listens attentively to everything I say and at the same time has the capability of making me laugh uncontrollably. Kinu and I have been good friends since the first year, and grew especially close in the third year. She is quiet, shy, understanding and sincere. Her serenity, loving, caring and forgiving nature is what draws me towards her. Every time I tell her something she smiles a typical endearing sweet smile that I adore :) ! She sometimes has a totally different perspective of looking at things; she tells me things that I could never think of on my own; she sees humor in some situations where I would never find anything funny and she sometimes passes such a hilarious comment so effortlessly that you would say “Why couldn’t I think of that?” I know I can speak my heart to her and not be judged. I know I can tell her a secret and she will never let it out. I can trust her to lift my mood every time I am down and I can trust her about anything and everything. She is one of those people who has made these four years of hostel life worth remembering. Kinu, how can I ever forget all the carom playing times together? I will so miss coming into your room every time I am bored, bumping into you every now and then in the corridor, the “Chhipkali!!!!!” times and all the random times we have spent in chit-chat and laughing endlessly for no reason sometimes. Anyway, it’s not actually a good bye yet, we have one more semester to go :) … Hope you remain the same always and get everything you want in life… tones of love, wishes and good luck for always :) …  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nisheeta-desai">Nisheeta Desai</a></p>
<p>When I met Megha, the first thing I noticed was her generous smile and obviously her height :P (never told you that you have a great smile :)). A lovely person who tries her best to scold people but always ends up helping them :P. She is a person to whom you can share all your worries with and you can be sure that she will console and help you in the best possible way. I got to know her from TRW class. Now it has become a habit to go and knock on her door every evening (during exams the frequency increases). The group study we did is memorable (which by-the-way included a lot of deviations from the actual topic :P). I was amazed to see how inquisitive she is to learn about the constellations and her fascination about stars is pretty evident from the keen interest she takes in explaining them (P.S. your job for next semester is to tell me all about it ;)). I had a great time with you. May you achieve all you desire in life and shine like a star :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
<p>Kinuuuuu!! It's rare to find people like you- patient, loving, kind and understanding. Yaar tere jaise log na aur hone chahiye :) Spent almost the entire first three semesters together (ALL classes same! yay! :D) You made all those dull hours of classwork not just bearable, but fun.. Sitting at the back discussing funny things by writing in each others' notebooks was our favourite thing :P Miss those days .. :( I remember we used to be spend so much time together in 1st three sems that some people asked us once if we are sisters :P Have some of the best moments in BITS with you-midnight movies, talking nonsense for hours, all the outings together, it's been so much fun! On a serious note, you ar eone of the most sincere people I have come across- kya dedictaion hai teri!!! Can really focus hard when need be.. With this kind of attitude I am sure tu kuch toh mast karke dikhayegi.. Baaki toh hum hain teko distract karne ke liye :P Love you Kinu aka kintiki aka Megha :D <3 <3 :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreya-kedia">Shreya Kedia</a></p>
