<h1 class="page-title">Meghna Mehta</h1><p>The true Gujju Girl. Very intelligent & hard working. Amazing dancer as well. She is very simple & a bit less social too. That's all I could know about her in 2months of PS. Have a great future ahead Meghna !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>Meghna..the ideal girl..  1 honest confession which may bring a smile on your face.. the challenge which we sometime had that you will change me or I will change you.. U won.. ? .  Its always been fun to hang around with you … though you made me a bit girlish :P  .  Working together.. or rather slogging together in workshop brought us quite close which was augmented by nettech and then the high frequency of same sections . Since the very beginning I have been sleeping in class and you have been giving me jerks :P with the exception of Chem-2 where you would be like..so jaa mere notes lelena..tu bada likh rahi hai :P. Time flew and I never realized when I started opening up ..waise I m gregarious so it was not a surprise.. but the better rephrase would be when even you opened up..since this was the uncommon part.. Destiny somehow glued us for 3 long years. We approached Sir together.. started project together, cried over the workload together. Though we were totally different ( you a quiet , speaking less types ) and me (a non-stop storyteller) , we amalgamated quite finely :P . Hope sweet coincidences keep happening and keep us in touch .. Wish you all the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>If there is a word called "gentlewoman" in English, it would fit Meghna perfectly. She is the sort of person who prefers to stay away from limelight.  She has creative interests (maybe because she is left handed :D) be it painting, music or dance (oh yeah, she happens to be a very good dancer too). Hard working and dedicated to acads, she is a pretty good programmer. She shares my love for reading books and I really loved our discussions on them. All in all, a simple, shy and silent girl who is a good friend. My best wishes for the future ahead. Keep that smile on :)   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>Dear Meghna.... I hate you! I really hate you for what you have done to me! Your sin is most hateful! You have turned me into a ... a....... a (somewhat) HEALTHY PERSON! *SHRIEEEEEKKKK!!!* Once upon a time, in the far far corridor of the land of CH 5, there lived a "fat - lazy - junk-food-crazy - most-unhealthy - border-of-obese" messy little girl whose one joy in life was to eat junk all day and grow fatter & fatter. But one unfortunate day, her EVIL "over health conscious - old people's food loving - paranoid over her non existent tummy - stubborn ass" neighbor was bored and she decided to turn the little girl's life upside down. She forced the girl to join the gym with her and started making her work out. And so, the happy self indulging days of the "poor-lil-girl-who-shuddered-at-the-thought-of-health-food" ended; the poor girl slowly started turning into her evil neighbor!! She began going to the gym regularly and gave up eating junk!! (well.. mostly). She even started liking ...*gasp*... oatmeal & cereal & milk!!!! (UNTHINKABLE!!) Now the girl is fat no more (atleast not as much as she used to be) and she fits her clothes no longer... :'( The evil neighbor's deed was done and she went on to look for her next victim -THE END Just kidding :P Sorry for dat non-amusing-long-story. Meghna u you are my only friend who has so many common interests with me. Be it our love for fantasy stories, or anime or our love for Merlin! I'll miss going to the gym with you. I'll miss asking you to wake me up for jogging everyday but never actually getting up. I'll miss scolding you about ur extreeeemely messy almarah. I'll miss your nagging about how unhealthy my food habits are (hey they did improve a lot though! & thanks to you!) I'll miss making fun of your granny-food-eating habits ;D... Oh & I'll miss taking pictures of you (considereing the no. of pictures i have of you, people would think i'm gay!... btw i'm not!) But above all, what i will miss the most .................................................................................................. are the nice looooooooong showers!!! ;P HAHAHA! 
(to people who read this.... please do not misunderstand! it's just our inside joke ;P) 

EDIT: I almost forgot! I was shocked(!) when i found out how TERRIBLE she is at packing & organising her stuff...(i thought she was someone who would be really good at that stuff...before i got to know her). You should see her laundry AREA. (Well i have no right to criticize as i am a messy person myself but only because i'm super lazy.)
 And O.M.G!! She's a HOPELESS case when it comes to making decisions... She once took 30 MIN to decide whether or not to buy a hair clip! (ok i'm exaggerating a little :P). 
And she is the queen of "taking-forever-to-get-ready-even-to-go-to-the-mess"........ OK Meghna... i'm done now. Don't get mad at me. I better run away before you come after me ;P
P.S: I LOVE YOU :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/lasya-boddapati">Lasya Boddapati</a></p>

<p>Met her during our MT-1 labs where there was plenty of time to chatter away and no work to do(:P). A very calm and level-headed person, she is hard-working and dedicated in her work. Keep smiling for all the years to come :) All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>
<p>Little Miss Perfect! Pretty, petite, soft-spoken and very graceful, you come about as a very pleasant person. Do you remember our joke about what we wanted before turning twenty? :P I guess it was you who introduced me to nail paints, I tried my hand at it for some time, I stopped because it takes a lot of patience and who can do that better than you? :P One rarely comes across a person like you, who so totally enjoys her own company so much, that to other people you seem to be shy; be it your solitary walks around campus, studying at SAC or out on the bench or as I have heard from you, shopping alone in Delhi! It was great to know you, and all the best for the years to come! Love<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/surbhi-khetrapal">Surbhi Khetrapal</a></p>

<p>From her gentle way of speaking to her lilting laugh to her impeccable posture, Meghna Mehta epitomises elegance. She gracefully balances academics and extra curriculars, and consistently excels in them both. Meghna, it's been great working with you in two of the most frustrating and ridiculous labs we've had to endure. Your patience and good humour always helped to somehow make all those painful circuits fun. All the best, I'm sure your incredible talent and dedication will take you far!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>
