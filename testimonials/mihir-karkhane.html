<h1 class="page-title">Mihir Karkhane</h1><p>We started out as 'mess' buddies, but I'm so glad that now I have the privilege to know him as a good friend. I admire his sincerity and the way his curios brain works while studying as well as while gaming. An avid gamer and badminton player, Mihir was also the Spree Workshops Head. Having expertise in both technical and non-technical fields, he is truly a great person and even more awesome friend. I'm going to cherish all the great night outs with him :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>The Mafia without his Decoder Ring. A great pal that I made primarily through those insanely long time-pass DC mainchats. He's great fun to hang out with and will make you laugh just by his characteristic gait at first glance. Overall a good friend who understands you and will help at all times. Will definitely miss the trademark "yoyo" greeting from him on mainchat. Wish him all the best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Karkhane will always be etched in my memory a "PRO", that he is. Extremely sincere, truly humble, very friendly and soft-spoken are a few words which I can use to describe this wonderful friend of mine. He belongs to the elite group of very few individuals in this campus whose punctuality and sincerity hasn't deteriorated, even after three years when it comes to maintaining a routine (I'm sad I'm not a member of that group :P). Those washed clothes which get hung everyday after his morning bath even to this day speak volumes about him. He is an inspirational personality, highly charismatic and a leadership material, which shows in his participation and organization of mainstream events in fests.  Paris and Mihir always make a deadly combo which gives nightmare to the opponents. A great man and the one loved by all. Thank you for being on my side through this wonderful journey and I shall cherish those times spent with you. All the very best for your future endeavours. Farewell and pls. do keep it touch... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>Karkhane is probably the most chilled 

out guy of all the people I know in 

this hostel. Lite lena koi isse 

seekhe. A guy so much in love with 

this place, that his BITSAT score 

actually forms part of his gmail id 

:D Remember him as the excited EEE 

student in our hostel during our 

first year who went on to contest for 

some EEE assoc post. Even though he 

failed to get a win in that election 

(lost by 1 vote , yes?), he displayed 

his managerial skills during Spree, 

convincing people to conduct 

workshops at unheard-of low prices. 

Oh, and the times spent mimicking 

Abhishek Kumar with Pappu were epic 

indeed :D Extremely honest, he always 

looks to have good, clean fun and 

doesn't mind jokes on himself - an 

increasingly rare trait. He is the 

sort of person you could trust always 

with blind faith. Mihir has been an 

absolutely great friend over these 3 

years, and he will be missed while he 

is away on his PS.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>Karkhane!! aka Karkhanis, he is notoriously slow eater! His meals extend to hours and hours forcing us to stay with him in mess. I absolutely hate going to mess with him, yet most of the times I inadvertently end up on his table cos he is simply awesome! Soft spoken, he always sees the bright side of things and always has fun. So much fun that he sometimes enjoys people pulling his leg :P A great gamer, he has played most RPG games there on DC++ Apparently he is also very active on DC mainchat :O All in all a very simple, down to earth, honest, friendly and helpfun guy. He is a rare gem of our batch and it was my pleasure to be his friend as well as mess/baddie buddy :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Mihir!! We've been friends since 1st sem, but as time passed we got to be better friends! I've made fun of his characteristic gait many a times, but he had (and has) the quality in him not to take offense at such petty things!! That truly is an admirable quality! Of course, 3rd year brought us together, made us mess buddies and with arvind, sukrut, paris and hegde, we've had some of the most (child-like and) cherishable night outs in Children's Park and library lawns! They are simply unforgettable! :D 
Never once did he seem upset. He always puts up with a welcoming smile and speaks in plain terms with everyone. No one I know has such emotional stability at all times! 
He's one guy who has the determination to pull an all-nighter without food (and water)! He's the last person you could judge by his simple looks - he's got such tremendous mental strength and I truly respect him for that! I've tried hard to learn from him, to have such tenacity of the mind! I got inspired at the very least, I should say! Sometimes I wonder whether he is an ascetic in disguise, who blends with everyone but is here to serve some great purpose for everyone's benefit! :P
Very well, he's one of those few (elite) people who can eat just as slowly as I do and knows that the one who eats slowly, lives longer! He ensures that both of us have company while in mess! ;)
Avid-gamer, fellow EEE compatriot, pro at embedded stuff (and in dealing with life's hassles), possesses leadership material and displays it only when needed, friendly, helpful and of course he's the ASCETIC! :D
It's been a pleasure knowing you and I'll certainly miss your awesome (and inspiring) company. All the best in all your future endeavours! Keep rocking and keep in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>

<p>MihirKar; my first friend in college. Sparring with this guy has been one of my favourite pastimes in college. Words like "chaprasi", "gawar" etc. are usually thrown around. Anyway, in addition to being extremely intelligent, Mihir is resourceful, funny and pretty good at AOE. Man, seriously, I'm gonna miss our little spats next semester. I hope that you achieve whatever you want from your PS/Placement/Future Work/MS. Keep doing what you do best, Chaprasi. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-raj-pant">Aditya Raj Pant</a></p>
