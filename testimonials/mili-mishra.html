<p>How do I describe this most genial and endearing friend. She has been a true blessing to me. I remember vividly sitting with Mudit in 'A' mess in the morning when we spotted Mili sitting a few tables across the hall. We mustered up some courage to talk to this girl on the pretext of "hey, we went to the same school". Instantly she rattled off like an age old friend. From that day till today our bond has only ever gotten stronger (okay there was a low moment when Mili took all the pains to sort things out ... now that I think of it I was a total jerk that i was not talking to her back then). I have shared so many special moments with her, those which if I so much as try to put into words, would be outright wrong. Mili is the best friend I have here at BITS and she has given me so much and never asked for anything in return. I will be ever grateful to her throughout my life. The bond that we have come to form over the last few years is nothing short of surreal. The emotion involved is so intense that I can't write all of this in one go... 

There are so many fond memories with her... my first trip anywhere outside campus, bunking classes and hanging out all day, those trips to bogmalo, the way she would console me if I were sad, those long phone calls of nonsense talks just because we had to exhaust the free minutes on the meter, the sweet gifts on b'days, the weird faces in the photographs, that acting all sexy and sensual to embarass me, those ROFL days, and so many many things that I just can't put here. Its a tide of overwhelming emotion rummaging through my heart. Mili you have been there when I needed you even if it meant sacrificing your own interests. I am glad that I have had this opportunity to write whatever little I could just to say one and only one simple thing....Thank you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-lele">Aditya Lele</a></p>
<p>The first thought that comes to my mind when i think of you is that Dance Club outing to Bogmalo! We had seriously gone crazy with the whole polo episode! :P I remember the first time i saw you dance, Big Break auditions, and i was like wow! You're a really good dancer! The first time we properly bonded was during zephyr fashp i think. And you remember how i forgot that i had to change my position on stage cause i was too busy checking you out :D Its been great knowing you, especially through ENI CDC's where none of us knew anything and struggled to get through those assignments together! And the lab sessions where we just wasted 3 hours gossipping. Keep in touch. You're a lot of fun to be with, and one hot dancer :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Milo is the one person i thought is really difficult to find. The sort who can do almost everything very well above the average!!! she sings so sweet and dances so cute! This species is difficult to find. She doesn't really talk a lot because most of the time that you are with her shell be laughing!!!!! She crack up any stupid joke and laugh hopelessly. Shes the sort who will trouble everyone the bubbly-chirpy way!! :P She is the perfect host!!! Her room is the lounge at a perfect distance and having all the basic requirements... water and  laptop with dc! :P If her room walls could speak ... they would never stop !! :P Basanti's birthday bash in ur room!!! GOD!!!! I don't think ill forget it taht easy!!!! And (i hope not) if Kirti n Mili are to become room mates! the entire housing society will be empty!!!! :P :P

Miliz a  really supportive friend who helps you in times of need. Thankyou Mili :) Ill really miss you!!!! keep in touch! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yashu">Yashu</a></p>
<p>When I met her for 1st time, I was like she has such a bad attitude (sorry :P), but as time passed and I got to know her a lil bit more, I realized she isn't that bad, and now when it’s been almost 2 n half yrs., I feel my views have changed to a gr8 extant. I can at least say that I am a fan of her.

 She is a lively girl with an up-beat and lively attitude towards life and always ready to have new experience. Always smiling with a bundle of overflowing positive energy, she is a beautiful person from inside (n some consider from outside also ;)).  She listens to everybody's grief and helps people without thinking what random people will say.

She is always ready for masti and makes the surrounding so cheerful that you forget about all your problems. And recently I realized she also has a sensitive side (not much still a lil bit).

Overall I can just say she is one of the coolest people I have ever met. 

Cheers to life ahead dear, have fun; keep smiling and spreading joy around you :) (Keep going to Bogmalo enjoy FRUIT JUICE on the beach with Ice n glasses :D n obv Kirti ;))

Keep in touch, coz ‘we need to talk’ ;) Will miss you :)

<p>Ab main kya bolun :P
She has been known to me since the start of graduation, but we gotta know sometime while we were bunking DECO classes. And the first conversation with her told me enough to send me to coma for a day or so. Someone I have known since a few months, she is actually who will make an attempt to make you comfortable with a group that you know shit about. Thanks for being that person. I will really be missing you guys next sem be. Matlab CG doston se zyada maine rakhti thi na? Anyways, kick ass in future. All the best......and before I sign off.....Yoyo macha :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sarthak-pranit">Sarthak Pranit</a></p>

<p>I know this Milo from day1 in hostel when she used to have curly hairs and wow have things changed since then.One person who used talk more than me and now she has gone all silent but I know she still has the talent left.She the "crazy friend" I never had and we had our share of pretty crazy moments(And when I say crazy I really mean it !).One person who has always been there to cheer me up and help me out(PS form was a bitch!). Her family had a hard time believing my existence (BASANTI factor :P) but now her mom always calls me up whenever she is out of reach(Its hard to take responsibility of this chick!). She is an amazing singer and dancer.The list of memories created together is so long that I dnt know where to start.These three years wouldn't have been the same without you.. :) :* :* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>

<p>Mili, when i 1st gt to know her name, i was so amazed at her name "mili", aisa bhi koi naam hota hai :P But yea a very good friend, cares a lot, always smiling, rather as a very big smile which is found very rarely in people. Always cool n calm, has lots of crushes n boyfriends n i hope this continues till u get married or may be even after that.  N one more thing about her is she is very rich, I can't specify the reason here for her richness as it will be illegal :P She also has a good voice n have heard her sing sometimes n she is really good......dude you should give it a try!! If you are a girl or now a days even a guy n if you have a handsome good looking bf, keep him away from her :P Cheersss n keep smiling :D :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
