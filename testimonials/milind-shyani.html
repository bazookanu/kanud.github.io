<h1 class="page-title">Milind Shyani</h1><p>Mr. Incredible of Physics Society. Tremendous sense of knowledge and equally pathetic sense of humor :P

I won't wish you all the best coz we all know you don't need it. You have all what it takes to make it big in life... Just make us proud mate :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>A person who can read a physics book like a agatha christie novel is ob "God-like".A very humble person who is still a child at heart.Never seen a more hard working person than you mate.A person with an encyclopedic knowledge about Physics.All the heartiest wishes.Make all of us proud (probably a Noble Prize?What say? :) )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-satish-kulkarni">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>True...Nothing to add other than Nobel Prize :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishnu-prasad">Vishnu Prasad</a></p>
<p>Really really really sharp. Well, to be so good at physics, you have to be. I sometimes forget that I do not want to do Physics later on when I hear his explanation to one of my many doubts. One thing Milind has definitely taught me is to search for elegance in the subject, and once you wear the right glasses, there is no shortage of them. And finally, thanks for bearing all my jokes and abuses at you. Especially the "Latex" one if you seem to remember. Thanks for helping me "get" Physics and making me see the subject from your viewpoint. Aur kya, phodega tu ob !

<p>met for the first time during a federer match in the common room during the first week of our college life and since then has been one of the best friend i've ever had!!!! has one of the greatest minds i have ever encountered... will always remember those "chai nights" in my room, the yummy dhokla which your mom sends, endless time we spent at mongi, the late night federer matches (which he always lost) and a lot more... seeing your extreme hard work and passion for physics i sincerely wish and believe that you will make your mark in the field and make us proud. All the best for your bright future!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>I could start of by saying you're an awesum  friend and amazing guy and I am thankful to god to have a friend like you.But no! I prefer to start with food. I would always cherish the times we spent eating hide n seek and "tasty nuts" together.It was truly  amazing. But as time passed i think we became very mature.
So we started making  and eating "maggi".
I am very sad about the fact that we will be seeing a lot less of each other but I will always embrace  the memories of the times we had spent together in my heart ,mostly laughing our asses of ,music, enjoying life in ways we know  and of course during tough times(nah I guess they were generally mine-I owned dat bitch).
And for the rest of it, I hope u achieve something really big in physics.(that kinda sounded lame)
(okay quantum physics or theoretical physics….or whatever).You are heading in the right direction anyway! May you achieve all your endeavors  in life.
In case you find yourself  in low spirits  which I hope you won’t , bas mera naam japna.I will be there :)

<p>We first met in Chemistry-I class. Our first meeting was really interesting. He was the first gujju guy I met in campus.  After that , he became like a brother to me.  He teaches me lessons of life. He has his own ideologies and firmly believes in them. He is one of the few persons in my life who knows me completely. Most of the time you will always find him shouting at me & his favorite quote for me is "Roto nahi baka". Needless to say he is true "Physics genius" . I am sure one day will come when I can proudly say "Milind is my friend".  I wish you all the best for your great future ahead...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>If I had a drink in my hand, I would probably be holding a toast to you "To the most honest, hard-working, down to earth and amiable person I and perhaps most of you have ever known"..... I don't even remember when I met him.. days,months,years passed with the velocity of boson particle :P with this guy around. An inspiration, it is remarkable how this person never has anything against anybody. No matter what people think or say Milind always stands behind his decisions and 'interests'. A wonderful human being, I wish you all the very best in each of your endeavours. May our friendship last longer than the half life of U-236!!!!!!!!!!! cheers to you bro!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Heard about him evn b4 seeing him. I was made believe tat he is annoying, irritating n asks too many doubts in classes!! N when i met him, i knew tat this boy had 2 b Milind! :P He made nandakumar nervous in class..well tats not it! He is one person who is genuinely interested in physics.. der was i point of time whn i felt it probably gets Physics-gasms ( shows how true is love is..for Physics :P ) Very innocent. Takes jokes sportively. I've seen instances whn ppl takes his case n he laughs along wit em! Cool guy. Gets excited quite frequently ( by a lot of things ).Has a pathetic sense of humor, bt whn he talks seriously, it turns out 2 b damn funny :D Very competitive whn it comes 2 academics but in a gud way! Tries every yr 2 get gals go 2 prom wit him n always ends up askin th wrong ones ;) Milind, the th kinda a person u r, u r a purely entertaining!! Every time u 'abbbbbee Yaaaaaaaaaarrrrr' i wud wanna laugh my heart out :) n yes! u r one person who motivated me 2 study..I kno i don wanna continue wit physics. I study so tat i can beat ur score :P Wel, tats healthy competition!! :D Its fun having u around n will always rememb th one so called physics trip to bogamlo! V all kno ul make it big in life! n maybe thn i can boast that th guy who won th nobel prize is a gud fren of mine :P 
P.S : wanna c u drunk once :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ranjita-pai-kasturi">Ranjita Pai Kasturi</a></p>
<p>Milind!!!!Milind!!!Milind!!!!!The gem of Physics..physics@milind...or rather i should say a  genuine fanatic of physics.I always got inspired by your contemplation,intuition,and perseverence towards physics.A perfect example of the saying "Follow your passion, the world is yours".Though i may not continue in phyisics, but yeah...your prodigy is seriously admiring.. .But then personally i was always puzzled at his smooth and casual behaviour with friends.Ground to earth attitude,Funny jokes,fantasizing words, jovial attitude etc...Apart from this, your donation to nirmaan shows ur concern for people and trust on nirmaan..All the best for your future milind!!!!!Make us proud!!!!! keep smiling  :)  :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>MIlind Shyani. Heard this name as some random topper of some Physics course. Since then, his persona as Physics god has increased day by day! It was pretty late when i met this friendly gujju and I love his sense of rationality, He reads physics books like Cosmopolitan i.e. just for fun. I have had innumerable discussions with him on varied topics and each and every time I felt the convo augmented my knowledge and understanding. My arguments with him have always been constructive in nature mainly cos he has such a patient ear for all the nonsense I utter :P Nadal vs Fed will always be our fav point :D Other than that, he is exceedingly amiable and outgoing and has a way with girls (but unlucky in the main department :P)  Im sure he will win Nobel Prize for Physics one day, and then I can claim proudly that this guy is my friend :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>August 14th(or something like that) 2009 ,6.30 PM .... was playing Badminton in my hostel...suddenly a guy shouts from the second floor " Do u mind If I play with u ? " ... and that was the last time I played Badminton....that guy was "Milind Shyani" ... its not that his skills in badminton forced me to quit the game....he sucked at it....but there was something about this guy that made me think "Finally ..a guy to fight with for the next 4 years" ...and since then we have had countless arguments, discussions ( I owned him in most of them) ... but seriously, this guy is THE most passionate and hardworking guy I've ever met... well..am not gonna talk about how good he's at physics...the whole world knows that... Milind as a person is the greatest ever.... always enthusiastic , his willingness and ability to help others no matter what has always intrigued me ...this guys is nice to EVERYONE ... I know some ppl think milind likes to show-off sometimes .. but when u've got a gift like what milind has... it's a crime not to show it off..so F**k 'em ;)...be yourself... This guy has always loaned me money during my 'emergency times' .. n even though i probably owe u thousands ... am sure kabhi na kabhi i'll repay it coz " We are destined to do this forever" ;) 

PS : BARCA .... LOL :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sriram-iyer">Sriram Iyer</a></p>
<p>Its takes a while to describe the "Milind" phenomena. At some point of time, I thought I could kick his ass in physics, but I was wrong. I met him first in Mod Phy, I suppose, and I am his big time fan since then. We had been together in most of our courses and will always be (that's my hard luck!). He has an epic stamina for sitting in the library and he is just ubiquitous in the class. I love the way he gives his presentations. Its so awesome. The only place I have seen him screw up are his computation projects but they don't make a difference. He also screws up with his accent sometimes. I have seen him so much enthusiastic for anything that might come. He has always been there for helping me out. So much for the good part. Now, you are just a big ass when it comes to finishing up your presentations on time. Think about the audience sometimes. Also, don't sing in the class, plz. You are really not cool if you do that. I have a lot more, but a bigger more respect for you. Now I don't say that you win the Nobel prize, because not every deserving person has got it. Just try to make everyone happy around you, and that you have always done. See you in Princeton sometime...Bow...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>To the best of my memory, Milind and I first met at Hyderabad. We had both been transferred to Goa, and were in the midst of our travel arrangements. (He claims that we met once before, but my memory fails me at that.) Since then, I have come to know him a lot more: living right next to him, and seeing him in in all his moods. Milind is a student of Physics, and a very passionate one at that. He lives his life by it, and even goes so far, as imagining himself in the shoes of great scientists, and simulating their thinking styles. He would love this testimonial to end here, but then, it won't. Attention-hungry as he is, he has made sure his love for Physics, Tennis and Association Football remain well pronounced. I, however have been his neighbor for the past three years, and will spill his beans a little further. Milind is a hopeless romantic. Impatient and erratic, he tends to over-analyze his relationships and ends up putting himself in strange mood swings. He feels his emotions strongly, and channels them through all around him by way of his charisma. He can be loud, very loud; he can act arrogant, very arrogant; he can be compulsive about being friendly, and put others in rather uncomfortable predicaments. But all that, looking back, has served to make him a familiar and comforting presence, who was a pleasure having around all through my tenure as his neighbor. Now as our hour of separation nears, I realize how much I shall miss you. You have already found the career of your liking; so may you far in leaving your mark on it, just as you have a mark on my heart!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tuhin-sah">Tuhin Sah</a></p>
<p>According to common sense, this guy shouldn't exist. But the law of large numbers applies in this case. I can only make a humble attempt to describe this giant of a persona here. 
Once you start to love this guy there is no going back, and if he comes to love you there is nothing in the world that can give you that feeling of belonging other than a mother's lap. 
I won't talk about his work other than the fact there is no other place for him in this galaxy but one of the Ivy League Universities and they would be lucky to have him. 
I don't even remember how I met him. From all the memories that I can recall he was just there all along. 
I can't think of a life at this place without him. Whether it be walking around in the cool evening breeze talking about the implications of one's decisions on life or the classic romantic movies, we share the almost all our views towards life. 
Everyday I spend this with person I learn something, be it his unending patience, his love for life, his passion for his work. 
His conduct with people had always been what is generally accepted as appropriate in society. I believe I have ruined that for him. Inspite of being aware of the consequences, I have enjoyed full support from him whatever mischief I proposed to do. We enjoyed together many a tea parties, fruit parties, mom-food parties, Bogmalo just-bored-nothing-to-do parties, star-gazing nights, and simply the times when you need  someone to share your thoughts with.
I had come here simply as a mindless simpleton. This person has helped me grow, taught me the way to lead a purposeful life. 
And yet it is me who has given him the most painful experiences of his life. During these, he never once even for a minute gave up on me. One of the only few people who are able to see through me.
People ask a lot of things from God - prosperity,health, peace mind, love and the list goes on... 
I never asked for any of these, yet He gave me this brother who encapsulates all that you ever want and more. 
And now I can shout out to the world, why do need all of that stuff, when all you need is a Milind and nothing else. But all of them can't
have him, can they now? There isn't another place in this ever expanding universe, where you will find a such a complete being.
Having this guy in my life have enthused with me with the faith that miracles do exist and now I can claim that I have seen one.
I cannot get myself to believe that in a few months, I won't be seeing this person all day long, always looking over me, correcting me every step of the way,  giving me all that affection.
This is the person who showers on you more love than you can bear. 
Meeting this person is what was written in my fate......otherwise I would be nowhere in existence....For all that you have done for me.... I love you Milind.

<p>Once you accept that this guy is over-sentimental, even by bollywood standards, you can only grow to love his jolly nature, his dedication, and his innocence. Yeh uss type ka banda hai jisko school mein parents dekhke bolte honge, "Nalayak, Milind ki tarah nahi ban sakta?". I admire you for doing what you truly love. Everyday, rain or sunshine, you'd be sitting in the library, reading that utterly non-sensical subject they call Physics. (I still have nightmares about Modern Physics). Most of all, you have a golden heart. You always think the best of others, and are there for their support. I know you're gonna be a phodu physicist, discovering great new things one day. Cheers to our friendship, and keep in touch always.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Milind Shyani... miiiiiiiilllllllllllllllloooooooooooo!!!!! I seriously have no idea whether i am even capable enough to write sumthing for you. Never mind, i'll still do the honors :P well i guess we were introduced by ananya so i am really grateful to him for that and then  we moved on from the "Hi-Hello" conversations to never ending shit during the modern physics classes where u always tried to make other people's life hell by coming up with with the most nerdy- geeky stuff dat perhaps wud have confused even Einstein let alone P. Nandakumar :P and i used to fill that dull depressing classroom with with sheer artistic brilliance by drawing "stuff" on the desks :'). Ahhh.... I used to think modern physics was the biggest mistake of my bits life but apparently some of our best achievements result from our biggest mistakes, that bastard up there has a funny way of going about things i guess :P. Since then the journey has been going on and i really hope it lasts forever.Now about you, initially I like everyone else used to think that u were a spoiled cocky arrogant shitpot full of attitude, but as i got to know u better I realized you are just a grown up boy wid a chhotu sa kid inside you( no pun intended ) and it is because of the deep innocence of that  baccha which made me think like that.You are the kinda of a person who will help even his worst enemies no matter how bad they might hv been to u. I can bet my life on the fact that u can never ever hurt anyone intentionally .You never run away from any kind of responsibility rather u wud overload yourself with them, you are always there for everyone in their worst times and when someone around u is down and out, i'm sure the first prsn to sprout up in his mind wud be u . I havnt seen a more helping person than you and i dont believe sum1 like dat exists coz u are simply the best. I have learnt so much from you and you had a big role to play in whatever i am as a person right now, i dont publicly acknowledge dat but trust me i am really really grateful to you for being around and i seriously owe you a hell lot. You have been there to slap me and bring me back on the right track, you have always been there to pick me up from ashes and give the feeling -" Get up you Son of Bitch!!!! ", you have always given me the necessary push but above all, you have always been there to show me whats right and whats wrong, how to be a good human being. I have learnt that if you are doing the right thing then you dont need to give a shit about others, just have the balls to stand up for what you believe in no matter what people say. Some of the best moments of my campus life have resulted from u being a part of it, trips to bog, beaches.. anywhere.... everywhere... long mongi sessions ...dinner table madness ... midnight tea/coffee time, raping the sweets that u bring from home, all these memories will die with me, mark my word for that.I wont be commenting on your nerdy side coz to me that is insignificant but what i like the most is u have faith in yourself and u do whatever u believe in, with mind blowing passion and commitment.I used to wish to have a younger brother like you :') but i guess i dont need that now ;). If any  person on this planet has a problem with you den i seriously feel that he will always weep tears of blood all his life coz i cant possibly imagine y wud any1 have sumthing against you and if he comes across me, i'll personally rape him in the middle of a crowded street.All being said, I feel that the world wud have been a much much better place if there had been more people like you.I know you'll do something remarkably big in future, wishing you all the success ahead , keep on making ppl around you proud and may we always stay in touch :')<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhiraj-tomar">Abhiraj Tomar</a></p>
<p>It all started back in physics 1 class (why always physics, I still wonder :D) nevertheless, he was as usual solving something. Curious to know what he was upto I said "Hi" and that's how I met this guy. We were more like "hi-hello" friends in the beginning before we worked side-by-side for Quark and soon after in no time, he was my close friend. He is among those very few people who actually see their future in what they are studying. To add he's an excellent long-term planner with an exceptional quality of working hard no matter what results are. I still remember he used to talk about one of his physics's senior who was damn! good and I believe he has definitely surpassed his achievements and still more to come, I guess. He balances his work, friends and other things perfectly. I wish I could do the same. Even after going though many ups and downs over last 2 years, he's never shy to share those with his good friends and whenever I feel low he's is the first person to know and certainly the first to help. I still want to know him more because such people are hard to fall into your lives. Thanks Milind for making me feel stronger and for giving courage to deal worst of times. I wish you all the very best for a wonderful life ahead.  "Nothing comes free, everything has a price" :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>I donot recall when I met him the first time the reason is that he always treat you really important person whenever you meet him.This guju is physics pro who knows more than most of the teachers of our college. We were a really good team in "Numbers" but unfortunately we ddin't win but I  am sure that the winner of "Numbers " Quark 2013 will be Milind Shayani for sure. Wish you all luck and happiness in life and keep smiling <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tushar-mandar">Tushar Mandar</a></p>
<p>Milu or shini or Physics God or Newton ki aulad or Einstein ka baap or next door whore......whatever you call him u gotta agree one thing......this here is the hottest gujju babe of all times....i don’t know if there are enough words in the dictionary to help me describe you this wonderful and amazing Bhabhiji of mine....yet here is an attempt. I first met him through a common friend.....his first impression was that of a spoiled, arrogant show off but as I got to know him I realized....this physics genius is nothing but an innocent kid with a generous heart, an extremely intelligent brain and an amazingly pure soul.With his extraordinary courage, strong faith and astonishing commitment....he sets everyone amazed...I am and will always remain a huge fan. Raw energy that’s what this guy is....an undying love for Physics and an incredible passion for his ambition.....we all know where this “Beautiful Mind” belongs.....that stage for Nobel Prize.....all yours buddy....you might be the only Nobel prize winning slut (:P). With his dedication to Physics he do come across like the Biggest Geek but trust me there is a lot more than what meets the eye to this guy. Talking about what an incredible journey it was with you being there with me and how lucky I feel to have such a wonderful friend sets me speechless. Weeks long discussions on what an asshole Newton was or how amazing life is or how pathetic life is or all “TWISTS” in the story or current rate at your Brothel…..videos starring you and your husband (decision still remains Gudge or Tommy)…..singing sessions from Bogmalo to Monginis……weird DJ nights…..all high on Life attitude.....all discipline sessions in library I had......in short this guy is all Love, Life and Happiness.....everything you look for in a friend...its really great to have such people in your.....people who would give up anything for their friends, for whom nothing is more important than the Love they share and who have each and every moment of their life dedicated to smiles for others. We share countless memories......it would be weird not to have you around in just 15 days......looking forward to an amazing 4-2 (I hope CS cdcs kick your ass). I can’t thank god enough for he has given me one amazing life and such wonderful persons to share it with.....I hope this stays forever. Thanks for being there for me buddy. “Its only in the mysterious equations of love that analogical reasons can be found”......a salute to that Beautiful Mind of yours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-mathur">Rahul Mathur</a></p>
<p>Milind , my sidey 8-D 8-D , a person with whom i love to discuss "philosophies" of life ( if u get wat i mean, wen i come to ur room at netime of day , lie on ur bed and start " Abe yaar....... " u know wat comes next :P ) . A person who almost always sees +ve side of everything . A verryyyyy sweetttt guy :-*  who gets 100 mood swings in a day. iske din ki shuruat nikhil ke door par knock karne se hoti hai... messages 10 ppl at night to wake him up at morning but ultimately its always me. music taste is like :-| , steals playlist and songs from people then boasts that he found saaaxxx song.... lol.... :P . very emotional and kiddish guy , gets hyper very easyily and fastttt. aur ek baar yeh hyper ho jaye toh poore hostel ko pataa chal jaata hai!! :D and if by mistake suresh/dadu are present nearby then ................... . Bahut bada tharki hai yeh even though many ppl dont know this. He is the guy for whom every1 waits to come from home. Sweets are out of world :-~~~~~~ :- ***** %-) %-) + he brings loads and loads of it. Best part is unlike many ppl who hide these kind of stuff , milind ke room par yeh sab aise hi table par pada rehta hai, poora hostel (ne1 ;) ) aakar khaata hai!. Acads mein kuch bolna zaroori hai kya :-/ ?? BC din bhar padhta rehta hai, the only and the only day when he doesnt study is end day of t1 t2 compre. next day se fir se chalu ho jaata,( 3rd year mein aakar bhi klepner padthta hai :P .when he gets frustrated then " BC aaj toh iski m@! c##@%$# , Shubham kal bogmalo chal rahein hai basss aur tum aa rahe ho , poora chadha kar aayenge  (although he or me never drink)..... ( LOL LOL!!) Best part is the way yeh nikhil ki G mein D dekar rakhta hai. frm the time nikhil wakes up till the till he sleeps Mr. Shyani is always there to monitor him and some really really "ROFLISTIC" conversation happens between them. overall he is a guy whom i can trust ,very sweet , genuine, kiddish, helpful guy whom i respect /\ . All the best for future and abhi toh ek saal aur pelam - pelai machani hai!! :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shubham-rao">Shubham Rao</a></p>
<p>Sir Milind Shyani aka our Halwaai (sorry couldn’t resist this :P) This guy knows entire screenplays of LOTR, The Dark Knight, Good Will Hunting and many more such beautiful movies at the tip of his one hand. Then the next tip is dedicated to all the awesome songs he knows by heart and also introduced me to (Coldplay, Porcupine Tree, Blackfield etc) And the remaining tips are reserved <strong> exclusively </strong> for <strong> Physics </strong>. Kyunki saale ko itna physics aata hai ki pucho hi mat :O He eats, sleeps and breathes Physics. But more important is his passion for it and his ability to understand the <strong> beauty</strong> of the subject/problem. This campus doesn’t deserve him. Had those awesome moments in 1-1 and 1-2 when mine and Rahul’s total would add up to his total 8-) He has this razor sharp brain but is a little slow in T1 and T2 (Compre peltaa hai :D) <br><br> Let’s talk about his more non superhuman like attributes. He is very caring, compassionate and would go to any length to help or support his friends (He was with Nikhil in SMRC one day before the CP online exam) He is the probably the only one who can predict me with 99.99 % accuracy :) He is also very dumb in several matters :) Love ridiculing him for not knowing something very common in general life or when Federer loses :D And never wakes up in first attempt. Enjoyed those awesome moments by my balcony, experiencing the breeze, pondering over various issues. Thank you for all those delicious kilos of kaju katlis.<br><br> Love. Pride. Friendship.  Caring. Helpful. Selfless and in the end <strong> Respect </strong> Milind Shyani. Respect. Hats off to you and your philosophy towards life. <br><br> P.S. – I always envied that long mane of yours :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
