<p>mimo is the first name that comes to me, when I think FUN. her laughter is infectious and jokes are incredible. and such a well read person for some one so jovial and fun loving (so jealous) I will never never forget all the night outs we have had and the spree DJ night especially. it was epic! anyone who wants to chill out, should be hanging out with us i guess.... every single time we racked our heads planning something and then end up doing something else altogether. except it would turn out to be a lot more fun. i think even in ch5 standards there are few people who gossip like we do, endlessly that is.  farewell, all the best. spread joy wherever you go, i know you will :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>
<p>Fondly called mimo :) ... one of the sweetest people i know :) Never miss having fun yet very disciplined in her every responsibility. Very fond of roaming!! you name it and mimosa can tell what you can get in which shop of goa!! be it beauty parlour, restaurant, shopping place .... she is a walking encyclopedia. A very independent figure.
I took chemical with biology ... and mimosa took biology with chemical :P I think she has what we call 'real love' towards bio :D Wish you best luck Mimo :-* ..... achieve great heights!! and always remember what i say to you in bio labs....... "stop trespassing our area" :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
<p>Yo Mimo!
Mimosa is a really sweet girl and its been nice to have her two rooms from mine since this semester :) We share the same love for tennis and have always had fun playing the sport with her on the older (!!) tennis courts during the countably finite times that we have gone there :D
She is a great girl and I wish you all the very best for the future!

<p>Mimo .. She is my cutest friend .. Very well planned and disciplined.... I can say she is one persevering person who will reach great heights. She is a simple description of the sentence " Smooth and Effortless over surface" . She is so organized , positive and fun loving persons I've ever met.   Great fan of Himalaya products. She loves memories and cherishes them - One quality anyone should learn from her. The care and responsibility she shows in her own life make you think that she is stating "I'm the captain of my own ship". All the best mimo .. may u scale great heights with god's grace :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Mimo.. touch-me-not...  pretty but yet tough girl (although scared of butterflies) ... she is very determined, optimistic and extremely  health-conscious and hygiene as well (:P)... recently, she has started speaking hindi which is as cute as she is... With happy-go-lucky nature, Mimo is determined  and dedicated in her way... having an amazing dressing sense and a great style ( of hair styles, nail paints..) she is fab... love ya... be in touch... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>The assamese beauty. I remember the first day i had met her...glowing in simple white n blue salwar suit n having that cheerful glee on her face.3 years on, she still has that same cheerfulness about her :). Her enthusiasm is mind blowing. The best part about her is that she truly follows her heart. She can get up n go to a beach at 6am in the morning..n she studies bio inspite of being in chemical simply coz she does what she enjoys :). One of the most optimistic people i no..I never find her fretting about any exam or cribbing about anything in her life. Everything's to be taken as it is and with a smile...right Mimosa ? :) Hope u alwayz keep that attitude on..it will take u places.. All da best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/niharika-tiwari-">Niharika Tiwari </a></p>

<p>Mimo is one of the sweetest person around. I still remember in 1st sem when we just came to campus, I heard that a lot about a girl called Mimosa. Her very unique name made me eager to meet her. And finally we did meet and instantly we had a special bonding :) She is the girl who would never say No to anyone. Always with a sweet smile on her face, she cheerfully waves at you wenevr she is around. A genius at acads, she has wonderful soft skills too. She has been the topper of our EPS class and indeed she speaks very well :) A gr8 friend to hand out with who would never let you feel bored. remember the fun we had at our doodhsagar trip? and the way u made all of us dance? :) Hope to have a few more trips lyk dat. Will miss you a lottt. Do keep in touch. All the best for future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sonali-bhadra">Sonali Bhadra</a></p>

<p>Mimosa.. A very sweet, enthusiastic person with whom I have spent most of my chemical classes and lab...I will never forget doing the assignments last minute with you, talking endlessly about the chemical faculty during the "ten minute" breaks, talking about good food joints, random places during Baral sir's classes. and OMG.. I absolutely adore your earrings, cute nail paints,matching hair clips, and the way you dress up.. Its really cute.. <3 But what I like the most about you is that you are very methodical and do things at your own pace. Ohhhhh,... you have an extremely cute smile  which I love. :D You are a very focussed person and are going to do great ahead.. will miss attending classes with you.  Just keep that sweet smile always and stay in touch... :) :D

MOM !! :) Thats what i see when i call her...a smile!!...cutest smile i have ever seen....and the best part about this smile is that its contagious. Mimosa,as a friend has been the friend i have ever wished for. As a teacher,she is strict but she rocks....she saved my ass in many subjects!! As a biologist, she is highly motivated to work in the field of biology...literally she talks bio all the time...so much so that it has effected my interests :P as well!!.Looking at her dedication and efforts, I am sure that she will one day make big break in her research work. As a Speaker, She is a different person when she gets up on the stage...her confidence is beyond compare...She is the only reason why i have somehow overcome my fear of speaking in front large no. of people. As a bibliophile, she can be freaky....she reads novel everynight....she was reading a novel night before ES paper eventhough she wasnt prepared for exam at all. These arent the only roles she have in my life...she is a walking travelogue for me....she has information about all the places in the world...she is my walking dictionary....i can always turn up to her for the meaning....she is my own personal writer....I love this part....Atlast i have someone to write mails and letters etc. for me. This passage might be one of the few writings that i wrote completely on my own in BITS life :P.....Last but not the least As more than a friend,I would like to say "little things you do for me making me smile when no one else could thats why i like to be next to u :) and i like that we share a secret or two ;P I know there ain't nobody else like you.No one could do the little things you do. "

<p>Mimosa, the girl with the most infectious smile.  A chat with her always lightens up your mood. She is always cheerful and in her company you forget all your worries. I wish her all the very best for future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>
<p>Mimo!! I don't exactly remember how we met but you are my 1st friend from the east. I don't know your language but yea it sounds very funny when you speak it. You will find her most of the time sitting all chup-chap with a beautiful smile on her face. She does every li'l thing with perfection. Fun loving, charming, very friendly, sweet and caring are the words tht can be used to describe her. Though we have only gone on outings together a few times, but all those were fun. Till date I have only seen one movie in the hall in goa n tht was all coz of ur efforts......the one we went to see in madgaon. Be in touch and all the best for your future :) and yea I haven't been to east india yet, so hope you will take me around the day i come :D. Keep Smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Mimosa....i still remember how happy you were when i came in because after a long wait you again got one room neighbor and i too was happy to get  my 1st  friend in the campus, and then soon i was a part of her group and so had more friends... :)
Mimosa is a very sweet, charming and a caring friend who always has that cute and lovely smile on her face. She is a fun loving and an adventures girl but yaa at times she is scared of  things (i still remember the efforts me, teddy and basant made to get you in the water at bagha beach)
Me and mimo have been good friends for a long time and have done a lot crazy stuff at times, remember 'our song of the day thing', that was the best thing to end a day with.
This girl though being from east and not knowing much of hindi tried her best and learned it that now she speaks it really well (remember keeda!!!!!), she is a good learner and is ever ready to face new challenges.
Though her branch is chemical but she is a real bio freak, never seen a girl like that and still she managed all her chem cdc's so well....A smart, hardworking and an intelligent girl, (beauty with brains). She is a big time library freako...at any time of the day you can be sure of finding her in the lib ;) 
All the time i have spent with you mimo are always gonna be part of my most cherished memories (but you know this sem  when i had no mimo next door i missed her so much... :(
I know sooner or later she will surely achieve all those things which she wished of. Wish you a good luck for your future.....Keep smiling sweety and always be in touch  :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavya-goyal">Bhavya Goyal</a></p>
