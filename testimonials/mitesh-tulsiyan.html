<h1 class="page-title">Mitesh Tulsiyan</h1><p>Mitesh is one of the few friends you will want to keep forever. We call him mooTHesh (if.you.know.what.i.mean.jpg), no relation at all but unbelievably catchy. He is a true friend. A good friend will help you when you are screwed, but a true friend will be screwed up along with you. You can never get enough of people like him. He is one person who will always be ready to try out new things, hang out doing random shit with you. He is a great person just to be around. He can achieve anything if he puts his heart into it. We grew through college together & we will make sure we grow old together. Best of Luck MOOTH!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>Mitesh is one guy who really knows how to 'take li8'. Intelligent, lazy, but works when it matters! We had a great time during practs! I was quite surprised by how good his photographs are too! Wish you all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Mitesh, this is one friend, I believe everyone should have in their lives. Everyone who knows him well would agree that he’s probably one of the funniest guys you’ll ever meet. No matter how tense the situation is, he’ll always find a way to make you laugh. He loves math to the core. Always finding simple solutions to complex problems. Also a big time movies junkie.. He’s very helpful, always ready to help you whenever you’re feeling low . He’s a big photography enthusiast, though not many know this. He never gets tensed , this is one quality that makes him different. We’ve had lots of awesome memories together. I’ll surely miss you bro. Always stay in touch. Best of luck..!

<p>Shriman Mitesh Tulsiyan, he was sometime called this in our ps-1 and this has got stuck in my mind, somehow. So here it goes, he is one of the most chilled out of people around in the campus and has this happy-go-lucky attitude to towards things which come at him. He was one fun-to-be-with person I had in my PS, and filled the outings(howsoever small in number they were) with a different flavour with his rather out of this world humour. He also had this craving for Mughlai food (what was it murgh-musallam?) when he was going around the restaurants in Delhi, its like he gets driven towards fun/enjoyment/good-food. And, I forgot to mention that he also is a budding photographer showing promising prospects as far as I got to judge them. His photo of a silhouette of a girl, still what I consider as his best.  All in all, a really dildaar aadmi to be friends with. I am sure armed with the positive attitude towards things he will make good choices in life and be successful in whatever he chooses to do. I wish him all very the best for future!  PS: I feel so fortunate to have been given this opportunity to study with engineers all around me. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>

<p>Mitesh ( or mittoo, as people prefer to call him ) is a person who loves to enjoy good things in life and tries to have fun in all situations. He values friendship more than anything else ( which has become quite evident over the past 3 years ). He is very talented at math and is really passionate about it. He is quite intelligent but prefers to use his intelligence for devising different schemes for scams ( :P ) ( apart from using it for solving math problems ). One can call him an appreciator ( my poor vocab :| ) of arts as he likes to click photographs, write blogs and listen ( and play? ) to music. I wish him all the best for his future and hope that we stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunwar-kanishk-singh">Kunwar Kanishk Singh</a></p>
