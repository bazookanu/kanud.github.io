<h1 class="page-title">Mohan Krishna  Vanga</h1><p>MK ,one of my earliest friends on campus. We met on the tennis court, where he was holding the tennis racket for the first time.Since then I've been amazed at how quickly he has picked the game up.His superb badminton skills need no introduction and his athletic fielding and handy batting deserve special applause.Academically also he's no less if he sets his mind to it. I've also heard that he's a god like gamer and its just another facet of this multi-talented guy. He is a very honest and has a heart of gold. Thanks for being my friend. I truly cherish the moments spent with you. wish you the best for all your future endeavours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>
