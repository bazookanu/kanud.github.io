<h1 class="page-title">Moheth Koppolu</h1><p>Moheth was very shy when he was first introduced to us..i remember it took him so much time to talk 2 us :P  He has been one of the most helpful ppl ive known...can always rely on him..n hes always been there. (even during some of my most embarrassing moments like the hospital ;)  ). With all the ups n downs...uve made these 3 years a lot easier :)... oh ya.. n i wish 2 throw ur mobile into the sea some day!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saumya-gupta">Saumya Gupta</a></p>

<p>watever u want in a friend, moheth is more than that.... i thank god to be blessed with a friend like him in this Stupid college days,...something good out of these 3 years
he is always there for his friends and a lil overthinker.. takes your <i> piddi </i> si tension and troubles himself a lot with it.   he may never agree to this, but he is the most sentimental guy, perfect package for girls ;)   
With the amount of passion he does his work drives people around him to excel too and helps him gain new friends everyday. studies fuked him big time in bits   , but who was spared by them. i Sincerely hope that he becomes a fine manager in a mnc<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dev-rishi-khare">Dev Rishi Khare</a></p>
<p>in one word - steadfast.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nachiketa-dash">Nachiketa Dash</a></p>
<p>moheth and i had the most awkward,embarassing inroduction ever (remember in the mess :P)  nd i dont think need to elaborate it further, though that awkardness and hesitation remained for quite a long time im glad that we have become good friends.He  is a person who cant see his friends have misunderstandings or fights, he will try his best to talk u out of the situation.,loves to read fan fiction,his eyes and hands are always on the phone weather in class or with all of us at mongi,i hope ur addiction to ur phone ends,somehow u end up hating gadgets all togethers...will definitely miss ur toota phoota hindi.!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-jain">sakshi jain</a></p>
<p>In one word steadfast :) I happened to walk through an open door on the ground floor with my hyderabadi neighbour. Turned out it was into another hyderabadi's room. What started out as a constant interruption for translation , turned into a friendship that i have cherished. Ever since that day the door has always remained open. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. Sometimes though you really should kick me out :P For example - when i fell asleep in the night and you chose to keep watchig movies till 3 waiting for me to wake instead of waking me coz u "dont like disturbing sleeping ppl" ..that was exasperating !
Out of all the others you have the most similarities with me . Be it reading interests ,fanfic or manga or actual books :) appreciation of random anime :D (never too old for that ) :D or requiring a little space for yourself when you want to think :)
you arent very vocal abt urself.. emotional but not vocal ... so that makes it a bit hard to understand what u need . sry if i inadverently messed up. i tend to do that... often.
you r an extremely dedicated worker , quick to get a grasp of things..and sometimes burdening yourself with more than called for (volunteering for making random videos ) .. but u have enjoyed every bit of it . It is these qualities that will certainly see you to the top :) tc :D thank you for three unforgettable years :D
ps-and thank you for alllllllllllllllllll the chocolates that you keep getting , even when you yourself dont eat ny :O :P :D & for having such a soft bed :D :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nachiketa-dash">Nachiketa Dash</a></p>
