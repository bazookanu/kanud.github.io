<p>MG as we call him.. I got to know him better during PS-1. We were roommates. He has very practical approach to life & studies. It was fun spending time with him during that summer. I guess the nights spend on discussion with him & Krupal(Pilani)  will be remembered forever. (Ek lodki chahiye:P). He is cool & very modest. He is a pro jogger responsible for few days I have jogged in my BITS life. I wish him all the best for his future.. Be in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Mohit Garg aka MG aka Goldy aka Seth JI
Honestly abhi tere bare mein likhne mein darr lag raha he…kch galat hogaya to tu suna dega :D
Mg a great guy to hang around with. He knows when to shift the gears…manages chudaap and studies brilliantly. He is very intelligent and always ready to help. One incident I  will always remember…he is the guy who came after exam and started kind of crying CHUD gayi as he cud only attempt 32 marks out of 40….dis is not why I will remember the incident… but when he got the corrected paper he scored 35(btw he was the topper). He is the  guy with a huge SUB-CONSCIOUS MIND :D. 
You can get anything done from him…all u need to do is hurt his ego :D. He has a vast knowledge and can discuss with him on any topic or u can say listen to him. He has been a saviour for me not only outside exam hall but also during exams….have got quite a few good grades because of him.
Its been great to have you as my friend…gonna cherish it forever.
PS: Next time we go out your drinks on me till u keep it limited :D

<p>let me start with one thing which no one in our esteemed club posses ,,,, your GOLD.... few more years and you could be the next bappi lahri. I  really admire you never say never kind off attitude.. I still remember you line people below cgpa 8 are chus.. yet u chose to stay with the bunch of chus like us :D. special thanks to you for being my jogging partner but i guess we were the most velle persons in our group so we had no other option also... you are the only person i have ever known who can get 35 after attempting a paper of 30 marks.. hats off to this skill... ab pak gaya can't write more ,at least of all people you can understand.. wishing you very best in your life... m sure u will achieve anything you want. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohit-tomar">ROHIT TOMAR</a></p>
<p>mohit garg aka MG aka sethji aka goldy, the only guy who can get 36 marks while he attempts only 32 marks in the paper.. such is the power of his subconscious mind.. he is an intelligent guy and a hard working one too & he is the only 8P in our group (according to him, ppl with cg less than 8 are chus :D)..  i wish that i had the strong will to study like he has.. your determination is unquestionable.. i mean who goes for jogging while having fever _/\_.. but sometimes, u make it a point of ego.. (thoda li8 lena seekh bhai).. regarding that, i will just say "kuch bhi karne ka par MG ka ego hurt nahi karne ka" :D.. and yes, how can i forget mentioning that u r the one guy i know who can compete with Bappi Lahri at wearing gold :P.. it was great spending such wonderful time together.. have a great future & may god bless u (with more gold :D)..  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jain-himanshu-hemant">JAIN HIMANSHU HEMANT</a></p>
<p>The fodu dude of Chu CLub who always scores Avg + 50 ( atleast in AAOC courses). Going by that I know u will phodufy CAT. The only competition to him in acads  is Chujaat who has somewhat realized( late of course )  that there is no job in Mech for Chus. I had a lot of fun with you during New year man. Best new year ever. And the most important lesson learned was : MG ka ego hurt mat karna. The 'tanker' doing by his capacity to consume 'you know what'. Respect.
