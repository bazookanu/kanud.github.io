<p>When I met  Mohit , I was never too much effected by his presence. But in due course of time , he has turned himself into an entertainment package .He can crack really deadly PJ's . Hence I confered upon him the title of MDPJ - master of deadly pjs ..!! Nevertheless .. a nice and a focussed individual who knows wat he wants to do with his life . Never feels shy of trying new things .. however bad he may be .  :P . A great photoshop user ...is always a step away in helping frndz with editing and stuff...!!  He is one of the few persons who is able to maintain LDR  with the same feelings that cud have been there with both of them being together . I wish best of luck to you for all the plans you have ... and i need not tell you that i would be getting treats than the one a royal orchids .. for all the success in life ahead..!!  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
<p>I knew Mohit through EPS and BPL. He has a great sense of humour and a very good speaker. Thanks for making some of the (extremely) long BPL experiments tolerable! Wish you all the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>Someone said that "luks can be deceptive". May be thats true, but its not the case with mohit yadav. He is just as he looks, calm, humorous, down to earth (in most ways), childish but with a great character and inner strength (which is something that i wish to achieve too). He is humble and you are guaranteed entertainment whenever you decide to hangout with him. He works hard and has great logical abilities. I still remember that ragging in AH6 in our 1st sem which was actually our first chance to know each other. Just don't think much about what you are doing mate coz whatever it is, is definitely right for you. All the best for your life ahead and god bless :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>I met Mohit on our first train ride to BITS, when all of us were wondering how our next four years would be like. We instantly connected. His extrovert nature and attitude is infectious. Though we ended up in different hostels, the few times we met, it would always be fun. Wish you a great life ahead, and keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>A very active and outgoing person, who needs no introduction. I met Mohit for the first time when we had to design souvenirs for BITSAA. Later he joined Melange as the Chief designer and that was a boon for me :) He managed the entire designing team very efficiently and was helpful at all times. A really nice and wonderful guy, who is gr8 fun to hang out with. He makes every moment with him worth spending.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sonali-bhadra">Sonali Bhadra</a></p>

<p>I got to know Mohit properly after a long time and when i did i realised what a funny and happening guy he is. He is a crazy guy in terms of his "OMG" jokes(thats the reaction you have after listening to his pjs :P), or his childish acts( remember mongi pe "taaaaaa" hiding behind the notebuk ! haha :D) or bi boht harkatein hain, his mini concert mongi pe( feeling sorry for all those who missed it :P) n manyy moreee....so in short, he is sooooo muchh fun to be with and always makes you laugh with his insanely crazy sense of humour :D its always great having you around and with the passage of time, we have become great frnds and i hope that this continues in future as well. All the very best in life and may all your wishes come true. Have a great life !! :D:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>One of those guys who know both Electronics  Web Development  and Android stuff.  Very rare quality to have. Whenever we have talked , it was about PHP or JQuery or some coding related stuff only :P But anyways is a very helpful , friendly person and a good friend to have. Plays song on very high volume at awkward times ( 4 am :D ) but yeah I like those songs :o) . Have a great future ahead and be in contact . All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swapnil-saurav">Swapnil Saurav</a></p>
<p>Arey Mohit bhaiya's one person whom I've known longer than any of the guys above/below(depending upon how new testimonials show up)! He's always had a smile on his face and though we didn't have a lot of chat in the campus, he has always been there when I wanted a hand of help. Ab toh kher, he has also left me with some of his "nishaaniyan". So I ain't forgetting you. :D Thanks for counselling me whenever I needed. :) 
Wish you remain the same, charming, intelligent and jolly person. Have a wonderful life ahead. :) And, bhoooool na jaana! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavul-gauri">Bhavul Gauri</a></p>
<p>I got to know Mohit in 3rd year - courtesy EEE and ever since then, we have shared a close bond. Fun to hangout with, all those lab hour sessions and last minute exam cramming routines brought us even together. The numerous lab report writing meets where we talked everything from career, Muthy to Viggy :P are unforgettable. Mohit has a good sense of humor, he is smart and knows how to get things done (remember the cadence assignments)... wishing you success in all your future endeavors, stay in touch!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Mohit Yadav! I I came to know about him during our short stint @ The Automobile Club :)
He seems to be a very hardworking and sincere person. :)
So he is like one of those people who participates in a number of activities with equal gusto! :D He has worked for Melange and for GTuG as well, with interest.
I wish you all the very best in your future endevours and in everything else in your life! May you achieve your dreams! :)
Cheers, =)
P.S: Thanks for 'those' wishes :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/namrata-nadkarni">Namrata Nadkarni</a></p>

<p>Mohit is an amazing person, very humble, down to earth, very funny. Yes we were in the same train to goa, but din talk that time. He is a person who takes time to open up with people but once ur his friend, he is so much fun. And he is a crazy driver. He cares a lot for his friends. I wish him all luck for his future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Mohit! With him around you'd barely ever miss humor! One hell of an entertaining personality and certainly fun to hang out with! It was fun working with you in EMEC lab and I'm pretty sure that it would have been really oppressive if not for that humor of yours! Though I knew him before, 3rd year EEE is what really brought us together. He certainly knows how to get his job done by all means. He's always this smart guy who finishes all his work with the least efforts from his side! :P 
The outgoing attitude of his simply defines him! Of course, he knows what he does and he knows how to respect all personal boundaries! Diplomatic in short! :)
The best memories I've shared with him are right after the exams and that's when he'd be around to give my mood a lift and ease the exam after burn like nothing else could. Though we've tried taking digs at each other, he's always been better at it! :D
It has always been fun to see the lighter side of life in your company! 
Keep spreading smiles and keep this social service of making this world a better place to live!
All the best for all of your future endeavors!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
