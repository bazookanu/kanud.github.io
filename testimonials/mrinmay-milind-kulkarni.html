<h1 class="page-title">Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni</h1><p>When I first got introduced to him just before the admissions, my first impression of him was- strict,no-nonsense,obedient,model student. I might as well have been describing Hermoine. So, first impression down the drain. This guy is so warm and affable, always in a chatty mood, he can talk about anything. He is well informed, academically as well as generally, and will usually give you information on any person-right down to their favourite colour! He is thorough, very particular and organized. And now something I wont be writing on any testimonial- This Guy Is A Great COOK.With the capitals. His dishes are a gastronomic treat, and he can produce anythin from Pani-Puri to some exotic Mexican recipe you cant even pronounce! Just watching him cook will give the leave the ladies wide-eyed.(I should have been there for that chocolate-worth travelling 235 kms for :-D) His room is amazingly well-stocked. You can get anything from fevi-stick to Earl Grey to an extra computer. Oh yeah, and he and the ring are absolutely inseparable :-$ He also excels at acads, and is a really cool mimic! He and Kulkya could set up a show!! So, Mammu, All the Best!! :D Have a great future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Even though he comes out as a no-nonsense person initially, after a while you realize, Mrinmay is a completely different person. He is highly ambitious,creative, competitive(I pity 2009) and hardworking.Cliched, but Mrinmay is really honest, he can get blunt at times, which makes him more fun.He has a taste for life, quite literally(you can hardly find anyone more sophisticated on the dining table). I thank you for everything you have done for me, you have not been just a mentor, but almost an elder brother-like figure, always looking out for me and wishing the best for me, I will always be indebted to you. Even though I know you don't need it, all the best for your future. I'll end with my favorite doublet :"May your times be interesting, may you get what you want". So long mate :)

<p>The guy who always sat in the back left corner in M Prakash. Mrinmay  is like a mixture of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff with a bit of Slytherin :P . A master in the culinary arts he is a big foodie with an encyclopedic knowledge about different cuisines. A chatterbox by nature he loves to gossip and can talk about anything for hours.A person who would not hesitate to give a blunt opinion he will always be there for the people who matter to him.His immense willpower,fighting spirit,determination,leadership skills will always help him in whatever he chooses to do in the future.He has been a big (literally :P) part of my bits life and I am definitely sure that it would be so in the future also.BOL Moma .... Have a happy and fun-filled life!!!! :)

<p>Mrinmay. A person with a competitive spirit and a never-say-die attitude. Seriously, the guy 
never never gives up and that is one quality that inspires me. Mrinmay is very ambitious, and 
coupled with his determination and enthusiasm, he is sure to have a great future. Mrinmay is 
very passionate about DoSM. He has given his all to the department while remarkably, never 
sacrificing his academics. Waves Marketing co-ordinator in our third year, Mrinmay showed great leadership managed to pull off a great show. A guy who calls a spade a spade, Mrinmay is very honest and has no qualms telling someone what he thinks of them. Apart from all that, he is fun guy to hang out with, always ready to share some juicy bits of gossip. We always have a good time together and our chats in the mess include some outrageous discussions. Mrinmay is a true foodie at heart and always orders the most sophisticated dishes which none of us comprehend. His culinary skills are amazing and the cake he baked at Kulkya's birthday was out of this world. A great friend, all the best for your future!

<p>Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni, bluh! Moma or Momita, is the roundest person I have possibly ever seen. The first time I met him he came across as a lil freakish (with his soft accent and weird swagger). But since then a lot has changed (courtesy DoSM). This guy is amazingly smart and way way too dedicated towards the department. A true connoisseur of food (despite being a Veg) I love his attitude towards a lot of things. A no nonsense humble guy who wears the same  chaddis (torn or not) everywhere (inspite of us making fun of it for 3 years),  he does and cares about the things that are really important and focuses on them whole heartedly. Best of Luck in life, and please get yourself a new wardrobe from Germany.  :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>Moma, i adore your great strength and your taste for life. You have been someone who has always seen life as sunny side up. Being a fellow EEEian, you know how hard life has been in the last few months or so. But you've always breezed past the difficulties like the wind in your hair. EMFW, Deco, Analog, you've  I will always regret not being able to bond with you much in our 3 years, and that's a burden I'll carry to my grave. Its been great knowing you let our emotions run wild hope this friendship continues for decades. I love you man :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Mrinmay, one of the most dedicated, creative and hardworking people I have come across in my campus life.My first interaction took place on a sponsorship drive to panjim for DoSM and it has been a memorable experience since then.It was immense pleasure working with you for waves last year and there couldn't have been a more apt person for the job."RESPECT" to the commitment that he has and his management skills. I personally admire him for not giving a shit to the appearance, he does what he likes to do and stands tall for it. His amazing knowledge related to food and cuisine  has always left me awestruck whenever we eaten together :P. A perfect combination of sheer innocence and brilliance :) ...not to forget his Drama Queen abilities :P.Wish you all the success with whatever you get involved in future and I hope u'll be the owner of a 5 star restaurant in Bahamas post retirement :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhiraj-tomar">Abhiraj Tomar</a></p>
<p>Woaaa.. my testimonial for this amazing 2009 batch, and it had to be written for Mrinmay first.. 
Mrinmay aka Moma of dosm, is a few seniors that i have been seniors that i have so open and free too in the past 1 yr. I dont really remember, when i met him first, we got close only during his tenure as a waves co-ordinator. he is trully an amazing person to work with. Dedicated, smart, although a bit shy,( thats what i initially thought) , he also manages his acads well.. Freaking 8p, with all on work, n what not on his head , respect . !  Mrinmay you have taught so many things.  you are always so supportive, and whenever i needed help regarding nething, be it DOSM, Acads, companies, sponsors or be it books, you were the first person, i thought of.. All the mistakes that you pointed , have actually helped me in every way.. 
oh and i forgot, his affinity for shorts n half pants, i have practically never seen him full pants before his farewell  :O ?
Anyways, have a great future ahead, please stay in touch ! :)

<p>Mrinmay is perhaps the first senior whom I got to know on campus so my first testimonial goes to him... My mentor in DoSM!!! :D
I remember the first time i met him...this was pretty much my first impression- humble 
bhola-bhala, studious foodie. I was pretty much correct(Except the bhola-bhala part. He's a guy who taught me a lot...
(even MS Word....and for that i will be forever indebted :D) His shorts
 and stuff may point otherwise, but his zest for life, leadership skills, his determination
, and his ability to mange everything so well is truly inspirational.
Thanks for being a mentor, in every sense of the word.

<p>I think we first got to know each other through BITS360. We had the same bitsat score, joined BITS as mechies, but later on got changed to EEEites! Then in MT2, we were in the same group. We had great fun doing those experiments, especially civil! Mrinmay is a very hardworking and honest guy. He will make sure he understands stuff, and if not, he is never afraid to ask for help- which is something I really respect him for. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
