<h1 class="page-title">Mudit Sinha</h1><p>Mudit - He is that kind of a person who will help you in any situation, no strings attached. One of the most caring persons I have known in this campus( may be it is because of his many friends of the fairer sex :P ). Any situation happy or sad you know you can share it with this man of big heart. As the Waves Coordinator he did excellent work and always came up with ideas for taking the festival to new heights. A devout blues guitar lover you can be sure that you can listen him play at least when the current is gone. About his share on DC, I know all of us have gone through it one time or the other. Thanks Mudit for making the life on campus enjoyable ;). Thou shall not be forgotten!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>Mudit Sinha, The "Mr. Smarty Pants" of the campus. A truly great person and has all the qualities you would want in a friend, a leader or a student :) ... The best thing about him is that he enjoys whatever he does and always has that glaring smile on his face. We haven't had much interaction over these 3 years but anyone one who knows him even a lil would tell you that he is someone you can always count on. All the best mate, have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Mudit Sinha ,  Probably one of my first friends in this campus, he is a really good friend. He has his way with the girls, (Play BUUOOY ;) ) he has been a part of every celebration in the campus. Impressive with his looks and his conversation skills, its amazing how he is a friend to everyone. MUDITAAA YOU ROCK MAN!! Wishing you the best!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>My neighbour.Initially for 2-3 weeks his room was locked.I though that he had moved to BPPC/BPHC.When he came back I asked, "You are back?How come?"Mudit says ,"Dude I was on leave,had jaundice". What followed was a jaundice outbreak on campus.(so now everyone knows the culprit :P ). The heartbeat of our corridor his passion for life is really invigorating.A  _/\_  guitarist,a good dancer and also a great tt,frisbee and cricket player he is a versatile package.I guess he has watched all english movies that are there on dc.His love and understanding of Physics is unparalleled.A jovial and honest person it has been a pleasure knowing him.I will always remember the countless pranks we pulled on Alok :D .Mudit you will for sure succeed in life :) . Keep smiling.Best of luck.Stay in touch!!!!

<p>Shampoo buoy of our campus, I don't think I need to specify further :P. 

Very passionate and a hard working guy (in all respects)....._/\_ Till i remember I met him in the starting of 1st sem, dont know how, n den he like suddenly disappeared from the campus....but also did good to all.....gave us all a good long jaundice break!! Very caring n loving friend, have lots of pleasant memories with him which will be missed life-long. One of his great talents is giving movies while playing dumb charades, he gets them from mars. One my most tharki friends......all girls love him, may be coz of his nature, appearance or his share :P. 

All the time spent with you around the campus, sitting for long hours at ice n spice, playing dumb charades, and the escape we had today (21/4/12), will be a memory n will be missed life-long.

May god bless you with more TeraBytes :)

<p>Mudit! Haven't known you for long but have definitely developed a great liking for the person you are - simple, innocent, caring, a physics fanatic (\m/) and a guitar lover (\m/ \m/). Your face speaks volumes about you and it's very easy to identify the child inside. :)
Oh and I hope to learn frisbee throwing skills from you someday! :D

It has been great fun working with you and having you as a friend and I hope it continues for a long time. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>He was the guy who spread jaundice in the campus, this was the way i was introduced to Sinha!! :P...Its been a long way since then. Its been a series of long meetings at Nescafe( we actually used to sit there from dawn to dusk, people used to come and go and we remained stationary!! :P). And of course then there is Sinha's word of the sem( Baudam, Bravo and Flubbers :P)!!..:D...He is the champion of unconventional activities in campus( Dumb charades sessions \m/ and your Ultimate Frisbee!! :D)...And more recently with the formation of the 'Deadly Trio', its been awesome evenings at Ice n Spice and CP!!...Although he is popular for his social service activities in campus ( Pantene had to be mentioned :P), he is nothing like it in real life!!..He is one of the dearest and sweetest friends who cares and loves unconditionally. But dude u need to loose the extra 'n' in your words or else you will soon become Himesh Reshamiya( it is 'haath' not 'haanth'!! Bulbul will so agree with this one :P ). What can i say about his sense of humor (my goodness!!...itne gande jokes marta hai tu Sinha and then when nobody laughs, he himself starts his weird laugh :P). Asking him to go out of the campus is a task in itself ( itne bhaav khata hai tu bahar jane ke liye!!..:P). I can just go on and on about all of the moments we have had together!!...:D..All these years were so fun with you in it and there are many more to come!!..:D..Have a \m/ life ahead!!...Love you Sinha and will miss you like hell!!...:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>I still remember the first time I met Sinha at Nescafe-If your friendship starts by eating Maggi together you know its gonna go a long way.He is an amazing guitar player, a physics maniac and a host of diseases ranging from jaundice,split personality disorder (lakhanpal), self-obsession disorder etc.Thou he himself is stick thin ,he is the guy who gave our group the name Flubbers.Have spent some of my best times on campus with him(dumb charades session, my first outing to the lake,Boghmallo trips etc etc). One of the people who cares a lot about his friends and one of my oldest and closest pals on campus, he has many different sides to  personality.His sense of humor is so bad( kitne gande jokes marta hai yaar). Kamine touch mai rehna hamesha. But just to let you know even if u don't u would always be a friend for life(That's not your choice). Gonna miss you a lot.. All the best for everything ahead and stay happy :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>
<p>Mudit was the 1st person I heard playing guitar in campus. Whenevr I used to meet him , asked him to play something . I really like his music sense a loot . This guy was also blamed for the Jaundice outbreak in campus , in a funny way ob . He is one of the coolest people I kno and has a very simple down to earth nature . Whenevr going to mess or anything it feels like to hang out in his room for some time . This guy can turn a sick stinking PJ into a laugh riot , and this is no kidding . Somebody will crack a joke ( supposedly ) , nobody laughs , awkward silence , suddenly you see Mudit , his shoulders shaking , faking a laugh , overacting basically . I'll be the 1st one to give in and I'll start laughing too , very hard and then people will laugh at me , and then its laughter all around :D . 
He is extremely good at heart , no doubt about that . Speed rubix cube solver . Very sharp brains . commando :P . Break dances sometimes , I like his singing too and his overall presence in managing fests and stuff . Pantene-pro-v , its like a noble profession ( next to a doctor :D ) . This person is very spontaneous , I'll ask him " Mudit , khelne chalega raat ko ? " He'll say " Abhi chal , raat me bhi chal lenge " .. After we are finished playing like always i'll be hungry , he'll say "chal IC ya Ive n spice mai khia dunga " and aisa karte karte we soon find out that its ni8 and we go back to play again . :D  One of the best frisbee players of campuss , learnt a lot from you man . It has been an awesome time with you . You are doing good , keep doing that and the world will be yours . Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>
<p>Mudit Sinha. Could’ve easily aced all the courses here. Could’ve easily been a 9p-10p something. Easily. The sharpest mind I know. Shame the guy can’t sit in a spot for more than a minute. Btw not his mistake, the guy’s just got too much of energy in him. When he gets excited, he will find you wherever you are hiding and get u excited. When he shouts, even Gods get migraines. And the embers of his eyes, always burning brightly with some mischief. Easily, the happiest person I know. Along with Prabhat, the life of our corridor. Got an unending list of qualities. A fellow AH3 night watchman, name a movie and he’s seen it. Guitaring,  Physics, Frisbee , astronomy, ur DEPP and TEDx work ...too many things to name here. Have too many great memories wid u.... The first tym I ever heard a guitar, the awesome horror movie niteouts, our unsuccessful attempt at moviemaking (not ur fault, ur acting was _/\_ ), random tp at ur room, our last minute study sessions and ofcourse the Gandhinagar experience. It’s been quite a ride, and an unforgettable at that. Good luck with anything u decides to do in future, I know you’ll ace it. Best Wishes :)         <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/japneesh-singh">Japneesh Singh</a></p>
<p>Some people epitomize certain qualities, Mudit does it for humility. He is one guy always willing to learn, something which I am really trying to imbibe. He has one of the most refreshing smiles on campus (I am not Gay).  I will always miss the times when I used to ask for extra slots and you used to conveniently forget, when we pulled off a random act with laptops and netcards during Waves and the fun we had with the TEDX bunch.  Those were jolly times..  I have started trusting my instincts, all thanks to the faith you showed in me time and again. Wish we had spend more time together, but then we have one more semester together. May you lead a life even Barney would be proud of. Dasvidaniya Mr.Legendary ;)

<p>Mudit! Or as some people know you on campus, Pantene. Waves DePP Coordi, Winner of a Nareal Award, fellow Poker player, fellow DOLA member ;),  not a fellow Frisbee player(good nonetheless), and friend. All these are the ways I’ve come to know you as. Met you for the first time in your 3-1, and it’s been great knowing you since then. You’ve got an awesome sense of humor, and an impeccable taste in music. One of the few metal lovers on campus that I know of, and one of the best headbangers I’ve evr seen. Also, can’t fail to mention the way you get excited while playing poker :P. Keep in touch man, and all the best for your future :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-bhatt">Chaitanya Bhatt</a></p>

<p>Mudddyyy!!.. this super fun, cool, frisbee fanatic was first known to me as the Physics God in AVKs class. Knowing him over two years now..a good singer and dancer, an amazing guitarist, has an enviable collection of calvin n hobbes :P and a brilliant handwriting. Very dedicated and passionate about the things he likes (which aren’t usually related to academics) and always remembers he has to start studying last minute!!! Also, his creative skills deserve a mention, for all the time he spent with wires n resistors making creative things he calls Tech-kala aka Takkala :P Will always remember all the masti we had in the analog lab which I always looked forward to (n the samosa chaats.. ) It has been a great having u for a friend.. Good luck! Cheers! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/disha-pramod-gujar">Disha Pramod Gujar</a></p>

<p>It's surprising to see how much Mudit changed over these 3 years.  In 1st year, no one could've guessed he'll become the campus-celebrity that he is now :P From the random and pathetic songs that he played, to the late night discussions, there are a lot of memories we share, most of which will be cherished for the years to come. Mudit was the only person in the corridor who woke up as late at night as I did, which meant we did crap-loads of TP together :P After his 2nd year, Mudit really evolved. He participated in so many departments and clubs, pretty much everyone knew who Mudit Sinha was. Usually this means that your Acads get screwed, but not for Mudit. He continued to Ace his exams just like he had been doing since his 1st year. Mudit is also one of the best guitarists I know in campus. From the 1st week in BITS up till now, he hasn't ceased to impress anyone who enters his room with his guitar skills. He was one of the inspirations why I picked up playing the guitar once again- and thanks for that :) Apart from this, his passion for Physics has been inspirational as well. 
Although his late night guitar sessions or his late night bhangra mood swings became a disturbance when I actually wanted to sleep, It was still an absolute pleasure having him as a neighbour. I'll remember all those times we spent either foolishly moon-walking in your room, playing ridiculously pathetic songs on your speakers, playing 'Hotel California' and 'Country Roads' on the guitar and watching new and updated 'stuff' that you got from god knows where. It was all remarkably fun.
I hope you have a great future ahead and may our paths cross soon again :)
