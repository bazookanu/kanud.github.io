<p>Gauti, Gautam, Bhaayaa(His Backstage nick), and then this year JaamBa- He has always been the silent one in Backstage, totally opposite of his personality on DC. He is a very good person and very innocent at heart. We have known each other for three years now, and this guy has been arguably the best one with projectors.He also did a great job as the SPREE coordinator for Backstage. Apart from Backstage i owe him a treat till date, as he has one of the major hands in me winning the Vice President election.  Thank you Jaambi for doing everything that you have done! you surely will be missed! All the Best for your future, you have come so long, remember now there is no looking back!! FTW

<p>Gauti,JaamBa,chavi,..one of the biggest jaffas i have ever met.lets start from my first meeting with him... Actually, we met somehow in our 1-1(i don't remember it :-/). Later,we used to spend time together in chem-1 classes, sitting in 3rd bench-playing games- in mobile. Passing time in cc(which seems weird to me now), playing volleyball and wasting time in every possible way. And thats how i screwed up my first sem acads where this bitch got excelled. donno how..I still remember the way he solved each and every problem in thermodynamics textbook at the expense of his cal'c and got a D..hats off to u jaamba :D :P.. HARDCORE DHONI FAN...donno y.may b he is also as weird minded as him. He is calm and pretends to be cool. He had crush on one girl in 1-1 which had changed as semester changed and this time,he says its true love. Well, god knows about that feeling. I wish "may god bless his love" as he is halfway through its success.  He does what he wants to do, wont give a fuck for anyone's advice. That is one of his bad qualities-of course,its enough for anything to happen(good or bad). This is our last sem together :(.. Its been three wonderful years and its time we go in different paths.hope you will achieve greater heights in your career(please don't go in the most normal way-i am talking about your job planning). You have a great potential in you which can create some remarkable things if used properly. Do something for the someone at sometime, U NOOBFK. Dont settle in life like any other lazy ass. I will be there within your reach at all times ;).hmm,enough for now. BYE, MY DEAR BITCH.
