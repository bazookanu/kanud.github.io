<h1 class="page-title">Nachiketa Dash</h1><p>Initially, Nachi never used 2 talk to us...we thought u had loads of attitude..but u were probably just shy :P   In the past 3 years ive learnt a lot from u... my reflexes have becum faster  4 sure :P ,my chess skills have improved (at least i think so..)  n i have learnt how to defend myself (2 an extent)..u crack the worst jokes ever...but they sure make me laugh (as long as they r not on me) ..i have never seen a more sensible guy than u (this is my first n last honest compliment 2 u ). I hate it wen u pull my hair or try 2 man-handle me :P but our evenings wud be a little boring without all this nautanki :)..im going 2 miss it all..  ppl, don't be fooled by the seedha sadha  guy u see...there is so much more to him than that :) hes got layers n layers, which may take years 2 unfold...but the deeper u go, the more surprised (or shocked :P ) u get..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saumya-gupta">Saumya Gupta</a></p>
<p>GOD :P   I rem when we first met in train,me nd arunima were thinkin ki dis guy never talks or what.U dint say anythin in the whole journey. :P The first sem we hardly met, d second sem u hardly tlkd  :P but uske baad se i hav to ask u to shut up :P No one has said me moti dese many times as u have and no one can ever come up wid such pj's abt dat single topic as u have. I hated it ,i still do.... but somehow i guess i myself cant digest that i dint hav a fight wid u d whole day abt d term :P... Ur stupid pj's ,ur godly blessings ,ur successful attempts to cross whatever i say :P ,ur football wid my chappal (yes u r d one who strtd
 it nd i hav lost so many slippers in dese years),ur watch (god i wish dat gets lost) which has been a weapon fr u;ur bones which hurt so much during those figths;yeah ur specs which always fly off nd u blame me fr dat,but above all i have loved having these fights with you...
Thanx for being dere all dese years.And yes remember i will b d one who will bigadofy ur children.:P I hate to accept this but i m seriously going to miss u next semester.

<p>Nachi is the first person I’ve met in campus, through whom I’ve met all my friends…..he is the least talkative person of the group, but when he talks he make others stop talking (most because they are too busy laughing)….his skill of shooting out one-liners based on the situation is amazing…..he loves chocolates and its always extremely funny to watch him fight over them esp against saumya and khushboo :P …..he is an avid reader of books, fanfiction and manga alike…..its been an amazing journey with u the last 3 years, can never forget the one-liners which come right out of the blue :D  and going to miss them a lot( esp on khushboo :P)….all the best in ur journey of life and hope u achieve all ur dreams…  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/moheth-koppolu">Moheth Koppolu</a></p>
<p>An extremely reserved  ,serious guy that was my first impression and so it remained for a long tym....but  behind that wall is a super funny guy,spontaneous and ,witty, his "one liners" will definitely leave you laughing(based on  whatever ive  heard until now... tough we girls miss out on a lot of them) , we really haven't shared or talked much but even then the mere presence of a person like you  who will just give a pat on cheek nd smile ... is comforting enough....wish u all the best :) :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-jain">sakshi jain</a></p>
<p>Nachi .. the most humble person i have ever met, he is subtle in his own ways.. a very kind hearted and weirdly humorous  person... He may seem quite and calm, but he is a very big kkamina
i've known him since school where i cursed him for his awesome sexy defending on the football field, he grows on u as a friend, dint even know him so well and still he ,from i dont know where , is one of my closest friend now. His understanding of the english language is class apart from us noobs , i hope he makes it big as an ias :D
sometimes his girly moody nature confuses me(not much will be aware of that ) , he forces me to think differently on issues that never attracted me before- made me rethink a lot of things in this world, his outlook is very different from the rest of us and very interesting too...
all in one i consider him a destiny child, i hope he makes it big in his future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dev-rishi-khare">Dev Rishi Khare</a></p>
