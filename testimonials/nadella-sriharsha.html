<h1 class="page-title">Nadella SriHarsha</h1><p>Naddy maddy!!! Hahaha…do u remember that little poem I’ve written on u with those funny words??
Naddy is a friendly person (one of my close friend in IS), calm (only if u r not close to him…or else it’s difficult to bear with him), hardworking and has got good knowledge about cricket. We share our interest in horror/suspense/thriller movies and tv series like 24.
I’ve never seen a person who eats as slow as he does…he takes atleast 30-40 minutes to complete his lunch/dinner. It was always fun to hav naddy arnd in any class. Naddy was always there in each and every crazy drawings of mine…do u remember the “shivaji” drawing?? :P
Gonna miss all those stupid moments with you in the class… all the best naddy…stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srinivasa-lahiri">Srinivasa Lahiri</a></p>
<p>Naddy aka harsha..i don't know him in my first year...and one day suddenly he came to my room asking which tv series are u taking home for holidays..>?>?..starting with this it went on to acads and then to all normal shit* discussions ...all these made us very close friends. ..(*some times useful..) ,,,all those moments we spend watching 24 in 24hours with lays and hide&seek biscuits..awesome..i cant forget them..they are just awesome..
second thing..he is a hardcore Nandamuri Fan..on this matter i am usually arguing with him..and he is IS lover also..he went to all classes in this sem..and almost all in previous sems also(except 2-1..so his cg got gged with that..)..pro cricket player..but lazy fielder...he won't move his ass some times although ball went by his side.... 
third one ..he will choose some(at most 5 ) ..shirts for one sem.and then he will keep on wearing them until they are gone..although his wardrobe is full...and don't go to mess with him if you are not patient enough ...as he will spend at least 30 min for dinner/lunch..he loves sleeping..
...he has been very helpful ..and funny some times...very kind...and loves change in his life...gonna miss you..all the best for your future..stay in touch..urs Vamsi Krishna<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yembuluru-vamsi-krishna">YEMBULURU VAMSI KRISHNA</a></p>

<p>Nadella..the way i call him..almost forgot the last time when i called him harsha. Hardcore MI,CR7,NTR fan. Cool, calm, who doesn't like to work/read too much unless it gets counted in his GPA. I always thought "he stays all the time in his room, doesn't even play games. wtf is he doing all the time??". Then, i got the answer"TV series, movies, Internet and SLEEP" which makes him lot busier than a gamer. A good cricketer-only at batting and bowling as he is very lazy to field. His taste is a little bit weird as we came to know from his list of gals on whom he had crush. Bad programmer as many of us but tries to understand and do something. His version of "taking li8, Hard Working for exams" has their boundaries and conditions apply. Ask him if you have any doubt regarding any software. He tries almost every software that is on DC. Whenever I see his lap,it looks like a software testing tool :D. There is a hidden batting baba in him-not everyone knows it. I wish you all the best for your future..will keep in touch :D.
