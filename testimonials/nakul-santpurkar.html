<p>I know him since 2-2 from MT2 lab. He works passionately for CEL and also has a start up under his belt. A social media freak, who first updates his qualifications on linkedin and then tell the world about it. He is a great person to talk to and has a very lively personality.
Wish you great life ahead, BEST OF LUCK !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

<p>Take a look at this man. Take a look. Can you take your eyes off him? I cannot. Pantyman, as I call him, is one of the most adorable people I have ever known, and I am going to marry him. Who can forget the epic (rescheduled) movie nights? Be it Alien or Luis Bunel's mindfucks, we have seen it all, haven't we? Be it our Velino sojourns or our EEE bitching sessions, I will sorely miss this guy. I will never forget the drunk mass 'I love you man' phonecalls that this slut made once. Impossible to dislike and forever hale and hearty, this guy will be an amazing Teletubby one day. But then again, he'll probably have a million startups and fine Russian women under his belt by then. Anyway, a few parting words are always in order. Tatti. There, I said it.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Santi ma man! We've had some insanely epic times these three years. Be it Bogmalo, or well..yeah mostly Bogmalo, it's been hell lot of fun hanging out with you. Be it TV shows, movies, tech stuff, or start-ups, you seem to know it all. I'll always remember the camera that automatically uploads videos to YouTube :D
I'm sure you are gonna be handing out your own "I'm CEO Bitch!" business card very very soon. Good luck and be Hobbes!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neil-dhruva">Neil Dhruva</a></p>
<p>Hobbes is this fat jolly guy, who belly dances more emphatically than he does at most parties. He is hardcore pop-culture devotee and polyglot, although he shies away from speaking in Marathi. Hobbes has learnt the hard way that all advice that comes his way need not be taken. Also, he is the ONLY guy I know who actually lived up to a new year resolution he made. <respect>
He is heavily into entrepreneurship, and is generally in the know about everything tech. He also loves Strong Beer. Well Hobbes, everything that you are looking for, lies in the answer to one question, "When is sex??"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Pantyman, Santaparker, Fatboy, Hobbies. A man with as many names as he has talents. Words cannot begin to describe Hobbes' well-rounded personality. Pun intended. I met him first on registration day and since then there has been no looking back. He's probably the most popular guy on campus that i know of, and he tries to be modest about it.Everyone knows that he is loves TV shows, anime, startups etc (refer to Neil Dhruva's testimonial), but not many know that Nakul has a deep knowledge of a variety of saunff also. We've wasted infinite number of hours discussing random topics that don't even concern us, and we still will tomorrow and not regret a second of it. He's a very gentle soul, and has helped me out on numerous occasions with the smallest of issues like toothpaste, but no-one has got away with abusing LOTR in front of him. All the bogmalo nights, velind trips and our night outs have been out of this world thanks to him. I will make it a point to buy him that book which consists of 150 mugshots of shit of different kinds for his next birthday and get him a toilet shaped cake. I can keep going on, but like i said, words can't do justice. All i will say now is that 'paaji, i respact you a lot paaji, gaddi chhodo emotion dekho' :P 
All the best, and you're not getting rid of me too soon. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>Hobbesh is the tech oracle of BPGC. An avid blogger and tweeter, pun king and pop culture enthusiast, he is aware on all things tech. I am especially grateful to him for introducing all of us to quora. I was always blown away by the information he had to share and about his views and opinions on new products, acquisitions, startups, etc. And my god TV Shows!!! 215 and still counting. I remember the day I saw his list. I was shocked. He is an addict! I have had the great honor of watching some of the best tv shows with him, his expressions and passion for the world beyond the screen is a sight to behold. Books, mangas, animes, comic strips, music, movies, angrez he has several vices. An incredible entrepreneurial spirit, he has great vision and business acumen, I hope you meet all the people you idolize and finally land a job in Silicon valley as you always dreamed of :) and of course I’ll be visiting<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shashank-acharya">Shashank Acharya</a></p>
<p>Hobbess, is one of the most kind-hearted and modest people. There hasn't been a time when i've seen him lose his temper, or even a slight yell. I've lost count of the times I've asked him to wake Pushkar up for class, and yet surprisingly, he's always awake. Ah3 3rd floor ka personal alarm, abey kabhi toh khud bhi so ! ;)
A complete TV addict, he tells me everything i need to know about any series or show. Sometimes so much, that i never really have to watch the show anymore.
Please for god's sake, don't learn anymore languages. It can trigger an identity crisis, trust me, i know.
Anyways, I hope your entrepreneurial ventures take you places. and please, get over your aversion for shit. Embrace it. Embrace the shit. Shit happens. Nothing ever got done with Shit going down. Shit. Oh shit !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aseem-patil">Aseem Patil</a></p>
<p>Hobbes! I have the utmost respect for this big friendly giant. He's one of the people i have learnt the most from in my three years at BITS and he's probably provided me with more information in these last 3 years than I've accumulated in the rest of my life. Hobbes just seems to know it all. He's one of my closest friends and the one who introduced me to pushkar, shashank and baba. I've spent countless hours talking about life after college and careers and entrepreneurship and what not with the pantyman but i'll also remember all the amazing times we've had discussing the most random of topics while watching the most EPIC comedy films ever. Hobbes' room has always been our "adda" whenver anything needs to be discussed. Anything at all, it doesn't really have to concern us, but it still ends up leading to shrill laughter echoing from his room when the 5-6 of us assemble. Its been an absolute pleasure getting to know this lover of tatti. :P Take care fatboy and I hope that dream of the six of us, 5 years from now sitting down and looking back at life, turns out to be just as we planned it! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Hobbes, Hobbesh, Hobbesh Dungal, Pantyman... call him what you like, Nakul (hehe) remains one of the warmest and friendliest guys around campus. A fellow EEE victim, Hobbes' jovial nature ensured that EEE was a little less terrible that it would've been (especially TSSN). He's the undisputed king of pop culture on campus, having consumed a jaw-dropping number of movies, TV shows and books. Pick literally any TV show you can name, and he'll give you a complete lowdown on the series - plot, cast and director included! His mad thirst for knowledge is reflected in his fervent activity on Quora, and it was this enthusiasm that made me join the site in the first place. Thanks a lot man :) An entrepreneur in the making, Hobbes makes for great company, especially when he's a few drinks down ;-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
<p>Hobbesh! one of the few persons with a passionate interest in cinema. He never ceases to talk about how fantastic (or not) the most recent film he saw was, and how what's happening right now is just like the scene from a specific movie. Chilled-out ekdum bindaas attitude. stay in touch Here's to a lifetime of epicness :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikunj-sharma">Nikunj Sharma</a></p>
<p>My first impression of Nakul was “Hey! A real Teletubby!” (Yes, Nakul. Surprisingly, I have seen that TV show) Nakul was the first friend I made in the hostel – apart from my Pune bunch. He came across as a very sociable and amiable person – something, I’m not – and, hence, the friendship. I think it was a shared love for LOTR that really cemented it. And what an epic one it has been. Since as long as I can remember, his room has been our ‘adda’ for watching epic videos, Hindi comedy and the most retarded reality show episodes; as well as for random discussions about music, technology and, of course, shit. Then there was MT-2.  From chemical to electrical – from shrill Manjuri to spanking Moorthy – we bore it all together (well actually only I faced Moorthy) and that set the tone for future EEE lab sessions – be it DECO or Analog. He has this uncanny knack of stirring up conversations and I would, invariably, end up trying to explain another aspect of my weird nature to him during labs. He’s responsible for most of my TV knowledge, pop-culture awareness, the latest commercial tech stuff, my cleaning abilities (your epic Majorda night) and also my abysmal nickname. A polyglot and my go-to guy for anything related to entrepreneurship, start-ups and saunf. I cannot thank him enough for his TV show recommendations to take home to keep my dad occupied. He keeps telling me that he owes me a lot – but that’s absolute trash. I’ve found a friend who’ll listen to all my worries and support me through thick and thin – that’s worth much more than a few lab sessions & borrowed assignments. Of course if you do come to pay me ever I’ll only say, “Yeh toh chillar hai. Main kya chindhi chor lagta hun? Firoti ka paisa laya hai ya maiyyat ka chanda?” :D To round off, a few parting words and clarifications are in order: a) WRT to thy kind testimonial, I am NOT averse to females. I’m just really shy and reticent. b) That bitch who mutilated my name DOES NOT hold a PhD. Aukaad nahi hai uski. c) Tatti.
Cheers, Hobbesh!
