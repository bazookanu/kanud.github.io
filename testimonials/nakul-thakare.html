<h1 class="page-title">Nakul Thakare</h1><p>Nakul, Kanul, kanya....
I met Nakul in the rather long registration queue at BITS, Comp Centre. Just like me, he had a Doctor's diary with him, and I remember thinking," Aaah, parents are doctors-at least there is someone like me." Then I cut into the line ahead of him, and started a conversation-he is one of those guys you can easily get into a conversation with, and even now, we have some 'small talk'. In the next few days, I came to know about his reputation as a Maths whiz. Then came the hostel elections, and the name 'Thakare' certainly caused eyebrows to raise! Then the warden asks, "Aapke rishte mein hai kya", and this guy smoothly replies,"Haan, door ke rishtedaar hai!" With his jovial,childlike personality and foolish-questions-asked-seriously way, it is hard not to be entertained by him! He is also a prominent member of the 'Shakuni's Eleven' and is always ready to have some fun. If you do not know him well, this guy can certainly hoodwink you. I will certainly remember Nakul for the interesting times we have shared:-the bus-stop and Ashram street talks! :-$ Stay the same jovial and 'timepass' chap that you are! All the Best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>If he is Prongs then I am Padfoot..A friend we all should have. Cool,calm,calculative,resourceful and logical he is a very loyal and level-headed person.
Known for his witty one liners Nakul is one of the most colorful person that I know.Mathematics and 'Mental Ability' are his forte.A genuine hard-worker I am sure he will succeed in whatever he chooses to do in future.We will always remain great friends :) .All the best!!!!!!Enjoy!!!!!

<p>Nakul has been my oldest friend. As in i dont have any memory of seeing him for the first time, we were together in school for 12 years, and then we had common classes and we had same corridor in BITS as well. Nakul has always been famous for his one liners. He was always a trend setter, but unlike ameya, he was always influenced by some tv show or some movie or any person as well. By influenced i mean that he literally lived the rolls of the people he worshiped. In school he was a "Harry Potter" fanatic like everyone else, but he was the one who invented the duals with a fake wand. Then in high school we were all influenced by "James Bond" movies, but nakul actually used to narrate the stories in first person ( we used to roll with laughter :-D). He actually used to believe that he was James bond at that time. Then it was all about "Friends" and Nakul actually started inventing even better sarcastic jokes than Chandler Bing.  In College he made us all watch "Prison Break", ( absolutely fantastic TV show _/\_) and then when we came to BITS we actually used to spy around with binoculars and climb hostel terraces and try to escape from campus over the walls :-D . But all the time, he used to actually play the role, and so precisely, that we used to also feel as if we are in the serial and we used to do all sorts of crazy stuff :-) . Then it was "Entourage"  and many more serials . Currently its "Game Of Thrones" and Nakul has taken exceptional interest in AOE rightly.  This may sound crazy, but we had decided to come to BITS Goa in 11th std itself, coz we believed that there is nothing better than a hostel life in Goa _/\_ . If not for Nakul I would have never studied so much for the entrances, he actually made me join M.Prakash ( our awsm IIT-JEE++ coaching class). He was always a genius and used to excel in anything to do with maths. In school he was exceptionally brilliant, yet ultimate prankster. Nakul's pranks never offend anyone, everyone enjoys them equally. He knows people and their thoughts very well. I have been his partner in some of the most ultimate pranks. Once he kept me as a false target, and threw a water balloon at some huge girl. ( she didnt even notice according to me, but we were ran away like anything :-D ). Once we (nakul, sumant and i ) climbed on the hostel terrace ( it was the prison break era) and pointed a laser beam in pagya's room ( he shut the entrance and we were trapped on top, but thats not the point ;-) ). Then we used to spray people with water and chalk powder and run away in school. Nakul is also a jeffrey archer and agatha christie fan. His extreme optimism has helped me countless times in depression. Sumant, Nakul and i met at my place after JEE, we knew we had lost it and were sad. And then Nakul said "nyway we wanted to go to Goa, ny good movie out???"  and all of us started laughing, my parents thought we'v gone crazy :-D .  He is one person who always keeps in touch with each and every person he has met, which is the reason he has so many things to gossip :-) .Actually Nakul has been my bestest friend since such a long time. He can literally read my mind just like i can read his !!! I am sure he'll achieve great success, coz its optimism that's the most important ingredient for success, and in bonus he also happens to be a prodigy. All the best  !!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-gote">Paritosh Gote</a></p>
<p>I have known Nakul since 11th and he is someone who has never changed over the years he is the Mr Cool .He is the same old folk who is always full of sarcasm and rhetorical questions (ho ka? kharach ka?) .He is a care taking and peoples person he will always start the conversation with "kasa ahes mitra ? bara ahes na ".He is a pro gamer whether its snipping in cs or creating knights in aoe or the level-headed approach in poker he is the man .When it comes to Mathematics there is only one genius its Thakre .I will always remember  the time we spend playing Laddies (cards game ),your 20 knights in 20min from east (aoe), hours of killing time by chatting and who can forget the Blair witch project. He is a friend i will always like to have around Good luck for all of your future endeavours mitra :). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raman-ladda">Raman Ladda</a></p>
<p>When I first met Nakul, my impression of him was, "What a chilled out guy." After three years of hanging out in the same corridor, and confirming that impression, he's become a true and loyal friend. Nakul is someone, I know I can rely upon, through thick and thin. He is a math wizard and a genuine hard-worker. This is one extremely cool guy and manages to be funny without even trying. He continues to amaze everyone with his "dialogues" and wicked questions-asked innocently.(Ho ki nahi Nakul?). Seriously, he comes up with the most witty one-liners even in the most serious situations, remember the poker and fit thing? Oh, and he also plays a mean game of poker. He and I share a common passion for, oh yes, Batman. Nakul is a TV show and movie buff and has probably seen everything under the sun. We must have spent countless hours in Nakul's room gossiping, discussing Batman, TV shows, movies and in general doing nothing. I remember the late nights of chatting and discussing cricket, Jeffrey Archer, Agatha Christie, Daniel Craig and other topics. I think he would have become a certain secret agent given the choice. Nakul is a pro gamer, and we've had some memorable times, whether it be Diamond or the hostel lan. Cheers to our friendship, buddy! All the best for the future, I know you're going to be successful wherever you go, and whatever you do. =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ameya-karambelkar">Ameya Karambelkar</a></p>
<p>When i first met him  I really got a wrong impression about you ...that was back in school when you ignored and shooed me away :P. As i got to know him better @MP  my impression really changed. Nakul is a prodigy when it comes to maths ... I remember Sunil sir "Nakul has already solved the problem what are rest of you doing?" when he was upto some prank as always.I and you have always shared common interest for puzzles and games.I hope I defeat you sometime in Gravity (:P). You have always made me laugh in any situation.I never remember fighting with you or even arguing ..well I simply start laughing while arguing.Nakul's room was "THE HANGOUT " place may be for some TV series , for awesome trailers or just chats .We called his room common room 2.  Nakul  is awesome carrom  player ...people go speechless seeing where he is trying to hit and where the dice actually lands :D.Nakuls innocent question are one of things that makes him a very funny guy.Apart from being fun and jolly guy, he is also very caring and often helps me out when t comes to taking decisions.
I still wont forget when you got up in single door knock at 3.30 am, helped me out till MedC when I couldn't see a single thing! ...really thanks ..it is always good to know someone is watching your back. Nakul  is TV show fanatic and big fan of Jeffrey archer. I rarely read a book or watch a TV series unless its Nakul reviewed :D. He is very optimistic and cool headed person I have rarely seen him panic ... only for one time when there was a RAT in your room . Nakul is very natural when it comes to gaming and deserves the title "Captain  of Exodus: :D. Anyone will always feel lucky to have a great friend like you.Best of luck for whatever you may do in future.Like or not I will always stay in contact :D.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prathamesh-dilip-gaikwad">Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad</a></p>
<p>Nakul, the most awesome person I have met in BITS.These could have been the best three years of my stay in campus rather than two if it hadn’t took me one long year to take a right from my door and walk ten steps to get to you.God knows how many one liners and jokes of yours I have missed in that one year,this is one thing that I am gonna regret all my life throughout.For others He is a maths wizard,pro in CS and a movie freak,but for me he is my best friend and companion in countless bogs and zari visits and most importantly terrace sessions  . Nothing can match the fun I had with you .I’ll never forget the insane stuff you ,me and Oak have done .  Be it taking tope’s case in his room or counselling me in my relationships  I know he is the person I can always rely on.How much sad or tensed I may be but his jokes(most of the times the lame ones :P) are just the right cure for me.He is the greatest PJ king I have ever met and the epic innocent questions he asks (questions are deliberate but he acts innocent :P) are just perfect to lighten the mood.I cant ask Almighty for anything more as he has given me a best friend as you.BE yourself always and enjoy…Cheers to our friendship!!! :) :)

<p>Thakare is the most calm and collected person I have ever seen in my life. He’s always mellow. I have never heard him shout or scream all the time I have known him. But he has absolutely no excuse for the lame one liners he cracks . They are so bad… they’re good XP One of the greatest snipers on campus, Nakul’s CS talent is legendary as is his nick ‘Sylar’. A great TV show and movie fan, it was awesome having great discussions with him about our top tv shows and watching It’s Always Sunny in Philly… He is a LOST fanatic  and although we poke fun at the show we grew to respect it just because Thakare liked it so much. I’m glad I still have another sem to spend with this great guy. I wish you all the best for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shashank-acharya">Shashank Acharya</a></p>
<p>Nakul,......Cool.Calm.Confident. Seriously,one of the coolest guy on campus!! Ever since we met in the 1st year(playing carom in the common room) I have been amazed by his coolness. This guy can blow your head off with his witty one liners and his rhetorical questions,both of which are followed by a mischievous smile. He is an excellent AOE player, but an infinitely better CS player.Nakul, you are so good at it, I wonder why do you do it for free?! Nakul is also a die hard fan of movies and TV shows.We don't need IMDb when we have him. There is a principle which says that, if Nakul hasn't seen it, then it must not exist.
But above all else, he is an excellent friend, one with whom you can trust your life with. I am glad to have a loyal friend like you!. Hope you have a long and successful life! Best of luck!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>Nakul! I first met him in Rachit's room. My first thought was "I must watch my mouth when I am around this guy, or he'll seriously cut me up with one of his one-liners." My first impression was sort of half-right. I didn't need to watch my mouth around him, because laughing about it was awsome. The part I was right about was where he would cut me up with his one liners. This he did with astonishing frequency, to the point that I got used to it :D. I seriously wish he had been in MSc. Maths, not only because I would have someone to study with, but also because he would have raped the shit out of everyone. He's an INMO guy! :D
Nakul is one chilled out dude who just makes everything work. I have no idea how he does it. Lately he has also become a library guy ;-D. Anyway, I have had loads of fun with him, and wish him all the best :) Cheers mate!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>

<p>One of the most laid-back chilled out people ever. Thakare will can ruin people's happiness just for a few kicks. Ardent reader, and big TV fan.

<p>Nakul the cool! One of the coolest persons I have met on this campus. I don't exactly remember how we became friends but I am so glad we did and after that there was no turning back. Be it anything, Nakul was always besides me ready to help :) Nakul is one of those person's on whom you can completely trust, something is haunting you and you need to share and get it out - Nakul is the best person. His timely and witty one liners...simply godlike _/\_.....you  all are stressed up and this banda in this situation also comes up with something really funny and brings a smile on your face. You haven't lived your BITS life fully if you haven't met Nakul Thakare. I still remember you me and Raman studying together and you coming up with dialogues like 'mitraa' and fighting on who is Raman's best friend :P Seriously Dude, How do you come up with all these??? :P ;) My gym buddy and a true bro....the one and only Nakul Thakare!!! We have to rock Mech next sem and also carry on our 6-pack plan :P ;) All the best for all your endeavours \m/
