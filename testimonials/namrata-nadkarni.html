<h1 class="page-title">Namrata Nadkarni</h1><p>Yo !! Met her first time during PS I at WAT.I can bet the last one year has been an adventure ride for me.

For the first time,I came across some gal who was as crazy after the Nadal forehand as much as I am,who adores the beauty of the game,who reasons out every debate and who lives life to fullest.She defines passion for life whether its studies,sports,writing skills; the passion in her drives to newer level of excellence. 

As far as my rapo with her, she is like my elder sis. Full of advices,Do's and Dont's so that my mood is on.Sometimes she even overdoes it to keep me happy with her lines-"Bro ! You are too good for it",when in reality I am wrong.The best thing in our relationship, respect for each other and understanding each others' position. I never have to give her a explanation.
 
Sorry sis,I know I act childish and all weird sometimes, but as elders you should too forgive it na :P . Dont u dare to forget me and keep in touch always( I wont leave an option).All the best for future life,you will surely reach the zenith of success.

If I missed anything blame Nadal, got his match to catch up.in 30 seconds :P

<p>Namrata Nadkarni is a fine young lady. She is a strong woman and a great sportsperson. It came as a shock to me when she told me she used to play football as usually girls don't do that. I highly appreciate that. She has the qualities of leadership and honesty. She is very straightforward and simple and that is the best thing about her. She is a really friendly person and one of my best friends. She has all the capabilities of becoming the next Indra Nooyi. I wish her a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Namrata is the most mature person I have ever met in my life. She behaves more like a granny  than a college chick! She has advised me on so many topics so many times and I am a much better human being thanks to her constant guidance. In college she has not only phodufied Acads but has been highly involved in a lot of extra curriculars. An exceedingly outgoing person. she is a true leader and inspires people around her.
Debating this strongly opinionated girl was always awesome with topics ranging from sports to the usual fav of Delhi vs Mumbai. I am a huge fan of her writing and Im desperately waiting for her blog. (Where is it??!!)
Knowing her has been one of the greatest pleasures of college life and Im sure we will keep contact in the future. Cheers to that! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>

<p>Nemo!!!...you have to accept that the name kinda sounds cute!!...in the years i have known her i have never seen her frowning...she is always full of "enthu"...and she has amazing capacity to laugh at really really old jokes...but she is smart, funny and a really nice friend (even though i hate the nick name she gave me...it doesn't sound that bad coming it from her)....you can never be bored when she is around....anything she says sounds funny...I am really glad i got to know you....ashich raha... :)!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-dighe">Priyanka Dighe</a></p>
<p> I always look up to Namrata as a person who really knows how to carry herself.She is really smart and good at heart.We share a mutual love for tennis-which is what brought us closer.And we were one of those epic Federer - Nadal supporter rivals.She has her own unique way of speaking.God bless her!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>As I must have probably mentioned a 

couple of million times by now, 

Namrata is the sweetest fest co-

ordinator we had in DoJMA last year. 

Got all the work done with the least 

amount of fuss and with negligible 

amount of histrionics, and it was all 

\m/ work; Spree was handled 

professionally, to put it in a 

nutshell. She has always been an 

absolute pleasure to work with; I 

particularly remember those frantic 

weeks during our PS-1 when we were 

practically spamming each other :D 

Yet she never complained or blocked 

me from gtalk :D Like it that she 

have a great sense of humour and is 

not easily offended. Oh and of 

course, her writing skills are 

nothing short of legendary, 

comparable only with that of the 

Eternal Father Figure of DoJMA 

Satya...absolutely loved whatever she 

used to write for youthkiawaaz (or 

something similar). Extremely hard 

working and honest, she have been 

amazingly patient while deaing with 

the rest of DoJMA core (2011-12) 

which was basically a bunch of 

misfits and society rejects. Have had 

many good memories with her (not the 

least of which is the Aditi Rao 

interview, eh? :D), and they are all 

extremely precious.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>Yo nads!!!...I dont think anyone else calls you that...  :P… She always goes around "Yo"ing to others and to whom people "Yo" back... Very fond of the word “Dushta”… Goes on saying “ Kasla Dushta aahes . !! :P ” always… A very very cheerful person she is with her sweet dimply smile and sweetly engaging conversational abilities.... A perfect blend of passion, energy, talent, overflowing  enthusiasm, care and what not.... Full of happiness and joy radiating positive energy around...  Never ever have I seen her frown... !! Laughs out loud (I mean really LOUD :P)... She is the one who really misses no classes... Sincerity at its best!!! With eyeglasses on first bench.. Notes up to date... :P... A person whom always you can rely on and talk about any damn thing you want... Absolutely anything you need.... !!! A person who is sometimes sarcastic and likes to twitch your nose by playing a prank over you... :P... An excellent writer and spokesperson this girl is... A die hard fan of tennis... I can never forget those fights we had over federer and nadal.... (Fed is still the best :P)... A good sportsman who used to play football for school (Rare among girls)... and now plays badminton.. Moreover, she is completely strong on her opinion and never ever is dicey in any situation... Sticks to what she says.. and does what she wants... Brilliance personified…!!! A true Mumbaikar… Oh how can I not mention those intense Pune-Mumbai fights that we had… (Except for Chitale you almost cursed everything that is there in pune… :D Its generally the opposite… The punekars who curse Mumbai.. :P) Super duper fan of Chitale bandhu mithaiwale…( Remember the amba barfi ryt? :P) … Also always has her way of saying things… (“Zh” and not “Z”… so its “Zhop” and not “Zop” etc… :P) .. I remember the EPIC argument over English spellings of Marathi words that we had over FB... (Which FYI I WON!!!  :P)… It all had started with the word “MAAJ” and not “MAAZ” as I remember… You were like.. “its MAAZ with a fine tongue movement MAAJ kasa bavlat vatata… :D… !!! :P …”… Another moment that I would like to mention was… “The one with the JORJORAT TAI” … :D.. (I know you stole my dialogue after that… :D)… Anyways.. there’s a lot to write about you… But That’s all for now… Thanks for being such a wonderful friend, a fantastic person to hang around with… I am glad that you bumped into me during this phase of my life… :P.. I surely will preserve this priceless friendship of yours…  All the very best for your future career ... Ashich hasat raha... !!! :)

<p>Namrata ...my dear neighbour... "The winner of The best daughter in the world" :D Thats the first fancy certificate I saw in her room. I had great time with her chatting over internet , technically we stay opposite to each other in the hostel ! Great Dravid supporter. We played Anuva's sky together her on guitar and me on keyboard !!! She is always ready with her edgy finishers that can make any situation a joke . Omg ! She has a gr8 sense of humor... She is one person who wears many hats yet balances out everything so well ! Aaal izzzz well Namrata :D All the moments to cherish :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Strong-willed,sportsperson, sports-fan, automobile lover. I first met her at that at that silly little IC engine radio car thing (that event turned out to  be a spectacular failure). She is the first girl I have talked Cars with. Smart, funny, and a good writer. She always refers to me by surname. I reciprocate. She starts a conversation in a booming voice, and puts a couple of "Modak, kay he?" in it. She speaks in the typical Mumbaikar style. All the best for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Hey nemo! That’s how I begin our chat :P (her reply being ‘Yo Bari!’) What an amazing girl she is..! Its impossible to get bored in her company… with interesting and witty comments on everyone and everything… She has her unique way of talking… talks way too fast sometimes… She is up-to-date on all happenings in campus and around the world :D She is a very good (and unintentionally rude :P) host at birthday parties.. :D We never miss talking about this on any of the birthdays! She intuitionally relates people to some or the other animal/bird (non-human creature in short :P).. I guess I was peacock for some unknown reason.. Remember ‘bakri’ (with ‘bakrat’ sound)?? :D And the ‘Lezhim’ graphs??? (We never made a fair copy of them ? ) She is a very good narrator… (Will miss your talks!) She is a sporty person.. Was football captain in school.. Plays badminton, lawn tennis, and cricket (we were in the same team, remember playing on basketball court??)… She has been a very active hostel representative for 2 years (once sport, once mess).. Spree ’12 coordinator for DoJMA… Event manager for some event in Quark.. And with all this she manages her acads very well… Attends every lecture and tut… (most of the times, rather always on 1st bench :P) She likes to fully enjoy whatever she is doing.. So she doesn’t like watching movie in audi (coz there ppl keep commenting during the movie) A very kind-hearted girl with cute dimply smile, full time entertainer and an awesome friend! Will really miss your talking… Keep rocking!! (PS: notice the exclamation marks ;) )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>I don't know much about you, n have only met you once or probably twice but i just want to say that you and Dadu look perfect together...Wish you a great life together.. Best of luck<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>The girl with an unusual voice but one of the most friendly ones,with atleast two brains inside her head and girl who is one of my very good friends on campus is how I describe Namrata. Now for the two brains part, she is a scholar this girl, misses not a single class and phodofys almost all of her subjects thats the first brain part. The 2nd brain and the most important of it is the plethora of knowledge she has about various issues,facts be it her knowledge about sports, about her opinions on different things ,about LORD OF THE RINGS ....she has it all..What I most like about this is she utiliises this knowledge perfectly in her blogs,news columns and  articles. I have high admiration for her writing because not only its elegant and classy writing but its simplicity makes it even more readable. Dimpled beauty as her sister famously called me( oops her :P ) :) ,she is one of the most humble persons  I have come across yet. This dost of mine knows quite a few secrets of mine and I have complete trust in her that they do indeed remain secrets ;) I m going to cherish this friendship for ever that I m sure. And just one last thing, May the WALL of your success be so high that it reaches the infinite boundaries of the sky :) God bless you <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
<p>The best writer on campus.Deeply passionate about acads as well as sports. (Big Nadal and Dravid fan).Excels in studies.A person who mingles with everyone and one of the few girls on campus who has a great sense of humour.Has a wonderful sporting attitude and is a cool and totally fun person to hang out with.Her biggest asset is that she finds joy in whatever she takes up and this is one main reason that she would achieve great things in future..A proud Mumbaikar :) . I am sure we will keep in touch.Keep smiling :) . All the best!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-satish-kulkarni">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>One of the true 'Never Say Die' lady I ever knew personally.  She excels in whatever she does and is a very focused girl. And her writing skills...SUPERB!! The other day I was in Sankalp's room and he showed me an article you wrote....and I was stunned to see your writings _/\_ The way he manages her time sometimes i feel her clock has more than 24 hours ;) It was a pleasure having you as my batchmate....I am sure you have a bright and beautiful future ahead!! Alwz keep in touch! All the Best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Where to begin eh ? I guess if I start talking about her I'd end up writing a manuscript. So I'd rather keep it short. An amazing amazing amazing personality. Totally skilled in God knows how many things as people above have mentioned before, and an expert in all of them. I got to know her better when we paired up for mixed doubles in badminton in Spree and I'm still happy for that day. I was surprised to see someone so talented and different to be so humble and caring at the same time. Made me listen to some songs I'd not have even dreamed about listening (:D). She's probably the first girl I've met who hates chocolate, coffee and cheese ! Yeah, even cheese ! Ok, now you'd say amalgamated and stuff (:P). Btw, smileys are meant to be used. I'd not brag about your writing skills or wit but would rather say that it's YOU what makes you the way you are. You have been one of my most special friends. I know you'd be a shining star in the coming years and still be the same. That's the best part about it. Hats off to you Chickoo ! I'm glad to have come across you and would always be.  All the very best for your life ahead. We'd stay in touch. Don't worry :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>

<p>PRO!
thats one word to describe this girl.
A MESS WORKER.
thats three more. :-P

Namrata you have got to be one of the most amazing people Ive met!!
Genuinely. Way back from the days of Sinhal's! Its incredible how in a span of 6yrs, from not knowing you at all we've moved to a zone where I'm hurling insults at your dislike for chocolate, convincing you to give up on the A mess (SUCESS! :-D), listening to you talk about the importance of the Eco dept.to our campus and of course, singing 'Disco Disco...' under the moon. (Your lisp still needs work. :-D)
we've still got a few pending things to do of course: Crabs at Martin's pending. A Jam session. And a chance for you to actually convince me that choosing a pineapple cake was a good choice. and many more. So, you basically HAVE to stay in touch. Else the ghost of bappida shall haunt you! :-)
Keep that laughter up, give me online company when im bored and pay for my golden fried prawns. Thats all I ask. :-P
Loads of love and luck for life ahead!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maanit-mehra">Maanit Mehra</a></p>

<p>Namrata! aka nemo.. (agree its nt a gr8 nick,perhaps even borders on lame, she is definitely not orange and white for one, but its stuck ..i subconsicously do refer to her as that out of habit now :P)
This girl is the life of any group..always making sure things are as lively as she is.. and the way she talks and cracks jokes, u'll be in splits in no time! There has never been a dull moment with her around. Truly an all-rounder. Diligent in studies, completely committed to whatever she becomes a part of whether it is dofam, or Dojma where she was the spree coordinator or Bluechip or IEEE, that RC car thing in d first year(huge list :P), hard working, great at sports(one of the few people i know who is good at so many different sports and keeps up with them as well),plays guitar, sings,great writer and poet,strong and sports a cute dimple(u'll see it in all her pics :P), has endured japanese meals(:P), never afraid to stand up for what she believes in and a really great friend to have. Phew! And i am still sceptical i covered it all! 
Got to know her first during all those tiring lezhim practice sessions, laughed hard at all those jokes she comes up with, then came the hostel elections. I m still shocked when i remember all those grand plans we made sitting on the staircase :P She is one girl i can talk to about nething! Any movie i want to discuss about she will have watched it, any book i like she will have read it, any song i like she will have heard it(in fact quite a few of the songs i like even now are her recommendations), can talk to her about girly stuff as easily as i can talk to her about football or cricket or tennis (still remember our partnership in that informal game we played wid d MM seniors? :P), always there when u need her and one of the most solid and dependable people i know! 
There are times when i am scared that there are only 24 hours in a day. Then i look at her and realise that if u truly wish to do anything or even many things, they are more than enough!
Be the way you are, you truly rock! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
<p>NAMRATAAAA!It's very difficult to write out things here as I am very bad at it. But nevertheless i will give it a try, inspired by your attitude of "never stepping back from anything". You truly have that, to do everything and do it right. Namrata, you have many talents that one cannot even think of. You can comprehend and adapt to anything so well. I still remember tha day i met you at the badminton court and how difficult it became talking to you. Playing by your side is always an awesome experience and will never be forgotten. Though i didn't talk much but seeing you at different places i got to learn a lot from you. Till date the amount of things that have come to me from your side have changed my life for better. You have that amazing ability to uplift anyone's mood when he is down with no hope at all. I hope sometime in life i am able to match up to your punctuality :P.The way you manage your time and complete the great multitude of things that you do (that too all of them upto the mark) is something that everyone can learn from you. You have that amazing ability to find out solution to any problem you have.You phodofy academics, good at sports be it martial arts(Karate),tennis, badminton or football(not to forget one who lead "school football team") and also the organisations you work for.You have amazing writing skills and debating with you about certain topics turns out to be really informative and fun.You are a very hardworking girl and a person that everybody admires. You are caring, beautiful and very good at heart. Never have i heard anything on the negative side about you from others, which is truly commendable seeing the number of people and the number of things you have worked with. It feels so great to have people like you around. Kabhi socha na tha ki aapse milpayenge. Remain the way you are and you will surely reach great heights in life!!!!!!!!!!!:D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-dadu">Aditya Dadu</a></p>
<p>Nadkarniii!!! I have known this 'fodu' for like 5 years now. We were lab partners back in our junior college days for 2 years ( Go Ruparel \m/ :D ) Since then, time and again she's proved how best she can fodo-fy almost anything :P . Apart from all the multitude of qualities (already enlisted in the hundreds of testimonials ppl have written for her :P), this girl has a golden heart! And I guess, that's what matters in the end. It's been a pleasure knowing this sweet person all along my college life... She's been one hell of a friend !! :)  And yes!! I love to take her case all the time :D :D :D Yo Nadkarni!

<p>Nadu! As I fondly call out to her when I see her in the corridor rushing off to A mess breakfast and wrinkling her nose at us C mess-goers. She's one of my best and closest friends, and the countless moments of fun that we have shared together are simply priceless. She's extremely witty, funky and always great fun to talk to. Her sporty spirit makes her tough and strong, but at the same time she's the sweetest and kindest  - one moment we argue over Nadal and Federer, and the next, we're giggling away at some little joke she cracked. She shares my love for
tennis, and I remember us going to the common room at 3 in the morning with chips and Coca Cola to watch the French Open final. Sadly it decided to rain in France, so the chips were eaten, the Coke bottle empty, but no Nadal! But we didn't abandon the match - we were there at 3am the next morning too! We've played tennis on the courts out here sometimes, and I wish it could be more often, because its so much fun to 
play with someone that enthused about the game. We don't have any classes in common anymore, but we used to uptil second year -there was CAS (<wink wink> Namrata, you know what I'm getting at!) and SPM and studying ES2 together,  struggling with the concepts, cursing Fourier, making up quotes and writing comments on the last pages of our notebooks.
Some memorable lectures they were!
I admire her skill to blend with any group of people comfortably, and be at ease. I'm sure she'll reach great heights, with her abilities and attitude. Love you Nadu!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>Namrata a very cute and sweet person( love ur dimples ;) )..very witty and her sense of humour is just AWESOME... everything she says is entertaining :) ... she is one person who can start a conversation wid anyone on any topic.. :) i dont really remember how i met u..perhaps it was just a random talk on the corridor in sem 1...but the Eco CDC's were the ones that made me know this amazing person so well :) 
She is a complete all rounder!! as the innumerable testimonial above already tell about ur multitasking skills, i just cant stop myself from mentioning it again! 
her dedication to studies and her immense efforts in all the other extra curriculars that she is involved in is just stunning..!
the random tympass sessions we had, ur special entries ('ladies' :P ), Eco gossips and the palolem trip wil be memories forever :)
