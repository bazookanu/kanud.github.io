<h1 class="page-title">Naveen Benny</h1><p>There is just one Al-Habibi in Father Benny's life- Football. This guy eats, drinks and sleeps football. The most serious, focused and dedicated member of the football team, he plays his heart out every time. Day in and day out. Can give any defence a run for their money just because of his sheer pace. Gets high on Cheese :P and then goes on and on about how he wants to be the best. Is a very good student of the game and knows a hell lot about each of its aspects. It has been a delight watching you play Naveen.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Before i say anything about him i have to mention that for Benny football is his 'LIFE'. I am not saying anything else regarding that matter since i am pretty sure a lot of people can elaborate on that part of him much better than me.
I will never forget the first time i met him, it was in front of the library when i was getting ragged. He and his father came upto me and asked me(who was getting ragged at that very moment) whether there was any ragging in the college ( XD) . He has been one of my good friends ever since. He is like the DoPY of our gang. He owns and single handedly manages Monna studios with his 3.2 MP phone cam. Capturing embarrassing moments since 2009...that his tagline(no joke :D). He can take some really great snaps but sadly most of is photography skills was wasted on Charly :D. Other than all this he has been a great friend all these years, and not to mention the CAD topper :P . Most of my best memories in college was linked to him one way or another.He was right by side screaming when Sundar almost crashed our omni right in the middle of panjim junction, when trying to stop a goods train using our phone lights,bribing the police( we have bribed them in 3 different states and a union territory..hoping to increase the numbers soon  :D ),running from mad bulls,the paint ball tourney and when getting kicked out of classes.A really funny guy once you get to know him.Honest,hard working and not so modest( :P).Yeah and one more thing he got a placement offer right in 3-1 (rising stars FC  :D) and  was awarded the best sports man of our batch (mostly because of all the extra illegitimate votes i pooled in for him) .Will really miss him next sem. ROCK ON   
DooooooooD  :)

<p>I have always enjoyed playing football with this guy, whenver  I ventured onto the football field ,dat is,  As a defender, I love barging into this guy and knocking him down :), as this is  the only when to dislodge the ball from under his feet, he is too fast and tricky. Other than football, he is a fellow mech dude ,providing company while attending to boring mech lectures. We share the same birthday too! Wish you luck,man keep enjoying football and life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nithin-s-poduval">Nithin S Poduval</a></p>
<p>Benny! My fellow winger! :D  He's without doubt the best footballer on campus! Benny's improvement from his level in first year is truly amazing! His effort, commitment and drive is something every single member of the football team take inspiration from! He's a kind, shy and really soft spoken guy off the pitch but you wouldn't know this if you were on the team with him! :P Benny's hindi speaking prowess has always left us gasping for breath while laughing our asses off! :D Its been one hell of a ride benny lava and i'm really going to miss taking to the field with you in the team! Take care! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Benny Lava, Vice Captain, Right Winger and the best damn one at that. He is what they call a 'defender's nightmare'. His dedication to football is unparalleled, his level of effort and performance on the field, unmatched. A big Lionel Messi and United fan, Benny has this knack of watching them train and try and implement in our practices. I really admire his will to learn and improve. He is a complete footballer and hats off to you for that Benny. Off the field Benny is another entertaining character, may it be fighting with sinha over who's 'the best footballer bits has ever seen', his supan imitations and most of all, his hindi. Benny, its been a pleasure knowing you, lets hope we also win SPREE together, next year. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>The number of times this guy has come running down from his room and knocked on my door just to annoy me for 5-10 min is countless, especially during exams to provide some 'encouraging' words. Also one of the biggest mistakes I've made after coming to Bits is a casual lie that i told him in the first year about paying for some oranges, which has become a long standing joke in our circle. He considers himself as some kind of a mind-emotion reader and has an opinion about everything others do or say. This guy also has got a lot of self confidence and has very stern beliefs, especially about football. But he most definitely is a pro at playing it, being the team's play maker and is really hard-working; doing whatever it takes to learn new things and push his team forward to win matches. Being in mech, the trio of me, him and sikhil have always helped each other in avoiding another rape in exams and managing somehow to get decent marks. Also he is a devout catholic, abstaining from all the ' harmful but fun stuff ' that goa so gently provides and is ready to lend his life advice to anyone who is willing to give a listen ( but stay away from that trap ). And also forgot the insane number of photos that he has taken along with photoshop enhancement, portraying the embarresing sides of many, esp.Charly. So much of good times to remember in campus, goa and chennai with him. All the best for the future and hope to see you playing in a professional football team someday, where I shall be supporting the opposite team :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>I am honored to be one of the first people to play with Mr.Football in BPGC. Football is his life. He plays as if it’s a matter of life and death. And not in vain, he’s one of the first in our batch to get a job offer. One of the best in our batch (he knows it and he shows it), his dedication to football is unbelievable. He keeps reading stuff about football, watching training videos and documentaries. Almost everything in his laptop is related to football. He also claims (read boasts) to be suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome. Naveen is a die hard fan of Man United, Barca & Messi and it is always fun to see him arguing about it.
In our first year he was this nerdy looking guy who was too excited of getting slided up from Chem -> Mech. He is the Dopy of our gang and the owner of a huge arsenal of compromising pics and videos . He was mockingly called ‘Rakshakan’( Saviour) for his philosophical advices and stances, but he became my real-life savior  in bogmalo [ thank you Nigga bro]. I also want to thank Fr.Benny for patiently waking me up every Sunday and making sure I went to church.
He is a honest and sensitive guy, straight forward in his speech and action. Supposedly a cool dude, he has been a good friend of mine for the last three years, together in the Waves Controls, left alone when Mime Club is busy, the ‘treats’ he forced me into and all the wonderful time we had during our outings and all.
Wishing you the best in life <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashin-george">Ashin George</a></p>
<p>FOOTBALL! In all ways is one word that can best describe Naveen. It would really be apt and enough for me to stop here....but still...The best footballer in campus. One of the first bitsians to be offered a job in his 3rd year, by one of the top Goan clubs.His dedication and commitment on the football pitch and his love for the ball..(FOOTBALL..not any other XD) is remarkable. We were always scared when he was in charge of training. The fastest attacking winger ever, maybe even the bestest the campus has ever seen and maybe will see further.
I had the great joy in playing many a matches with him, in bpl-10 and bpl-11, we won both of the cups.A great personality, an amazing athlete, and a very good, gentle, caring, helpful friend.The great times we had in all the outings and the church choir and all will always be cherished. The DHOOTHSAGAR is one hell of a day we had, and that will never ever disappear.Kudos to the man.... :). All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/seby-jacob">Seby Jacob</a></p>

<p>I couldn't have asked for a better neighbor and friend than benny.-  soft spoken, humble as well as the football star /pro athlete of our campus! We have some talented players on campus, but few of them are as dedicated and passionate towards the game as benny. Always calm and composed (hallmark of a great athlete), I've never seen him lose his cool . Even before exams, you can see him chilled out and probably watching the latest football match :P Really sad that we aren't in the same sem next year- I'll  miss the familiar sound of the football outside my room :) All the best and do keep in touch !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayush-sanyal">Ayush Sanyal</a></p>

<p>Father Benny,CAD Topper Benny! Thats how every1 knows u these days :D You have been like a godfather in mech to me for all these years (well, not as much as for shakku :D). Always there to help us and having our best interests at heart. :) An avid football lover, it was fun to have all those small fights with you about stupid ManU :P Enjoyed watching you play football for the few number of games I DID come to watch :D The DoPY of our gang! Continue the good work with Monna Studios Ltd (I guess charly wouldnt mind continuing as your model) :D A really honest and straightforward guy, never shows hesitation in expressing his opinion about something. A self-controlled guy with strong beliefs, I envy you for that man! Will miss u next year! Hope you have an amazing future, and keep in touch :) ATB!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-v-chandran">Aswin V Chandran</a></p>
<p>Naveen! At first I was actually confused what to call you, “Naveen” or “Benny” :P( I’d heard the name before). MED and GRE, the two words that got us talking…I have bugged you a lot during the lab sessions and you patiently told me everything, thanks :) it was nice sitting beside you. Little did I know, that the person sitting next to me is the star footballer, until this BPL :P .. All the very best for your future. I know u WILL do it… keep in touch and yes, I love your smile :) :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/poorwa-shekhar">POORWA SHEKHAR</a></p>
<p>actually we dont have much in common. He is a sport loving person. I am on the other side. But somehow we became  friends. Helped me a lot at the time of PT practicals. I dont know how he wrote the notes and every step to operate CNC machine. Proness.. No point in talking abt his football skills. I guess everyone in campus ( oh sorry everyone in goa maybe india know him for his football skills). 
PS : you never asked me about GRE hunh?? :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
