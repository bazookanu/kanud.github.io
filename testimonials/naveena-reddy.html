<p>Naveena is one of the most Accomodating and Loving personalities i have known :D Sensitive and good at heart :D ..... We became Real good Buddies only after biology cdc started..... but always had a special bond within us since our common CDS physics 1 class ;) Through all the combine classes in which I have drawn numerous drawings for her.... and do everything except paying attention to CDS .... I have enjoyed every moment around her a lot! A sharp mind she is. Having even branches alike... we have worked together enuf to say that - She can anytime defeat every single person in terms of marks! - She just need some 'longlasting' determination :D Always have some innovative Idea in her mind - We have sided out all 'general gals discussion topics' :P Its always fun talking to her on non conventional topics :D Her practical approach will always leave you with an intelligent Insight. The daily sudden Vasco, madgaon trips with no destination and no money in Pocket will always be moments of Adventure and Fun for me :D No Matter Whatever Comes your Way... Chase your dreams till they cannot escape you :) Good Luck with your Future !!! ... and have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
<p>mummu is the youngest girl in 2k9 batch ( she lied abt her b'day to bits :P ) . The first time I sw mummu aka naveena on d first day of campus .. my first impression was " what a nerd !" ... But I was wrong .. This person is so friendly and caring and may be WAS A NERD (Phodu in Inter - Loves her Chaitanya clg alot ) ;)  .. ( cute- sweet- Hot !(remember that blue top pic ??) :P ) . She also underwent lot of metamorphosis  ( removed her sodaglasses , got a hairstyle :D ) got her ID pic changed .  We ate , drank , sat , worked , jumped , walked , ran and  fell together in Biology :P  Very dedicated person in lab ( only one to credit from her group -- she is a responsible group leader) and as a  Hostel Rep .. She has a HUGE friends circle .. Many best friends .. Very sociable ( she is the first who told me abt plastics :P ) , practical , fun , mad - ( pouring sand over me in Bogmalo in ;) state )  . Constantly tells me how to eat and hold a spoon ( I could never learn it ) . Had many many fun moments wid u ... You have awesome leadership abilities , ability to mingle with friends .. Always enjoyed the stories u told abt ur dad ..  uncle is \m/ . . . And you too are \m/ .. I love those sweet memories I had with u in BITS .. I'll keep in touch !

Marvellous !! :P :) This girl who has a heart of gold..will be always ready to help without an itch..! :D A very open and cute girl who has all good values imbibed in her.. :) Have spent so many unforgettable moments with you in the lab and back in hostel..!!

One of my bestest frnds.. Who has been with me alwayss..!
From the day we met in our first year during the trip we went..  to today..!! u've always been a lovely friend any1 can ask for.!!
The youngest in the batch.. But with the most matured thinking.. !!
The first year.. it was always u n me togethr.. either in ur room or in mine..!!
Though u've been busy with bio now..!! Can rarely see u.. with all ur labs.. and me involved in other stuff.. But we still have 4-2.. to compensate for the tym we lost..
The first person to get a laptop.. :D  and so had a lot of demand in the first year :P
We just love making fun of u wen ur with us.. whether its all of us or with satty...!!
I had many amazing moments with u..
U were always there for me.. weneva needed.. a shoulder to rest on.. a friend to tell things.. who used to take care of me..!! 
Her knowledge about things is wonderful.. and her insight in things is amazing..!!
A green lover.. i guess thats y she took bio..  :PBTW by green i mean the color Green.. Her room reflects that..!! loves everything about both bio and green.. :D
A very forgiving person.. and a very cheerful and fun loving person.. loves watchin eng movieess.. donno her count in movies and novels in these 3 yrs myt have crossed mine all together till now..
A gr8 cook.. Though i missed her cooking.. she loves getting ready, n helpin others in that :P 
I can keep goin on abt u.. but will put an end here..
Cheers to three years of awsomeness..!! love u loadsssss..!! will surely be in touch with u.. U r one person i can never imagine to let go n leave in life.. 
friends 4eva..!! take care n keep rocking..!!  :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kavya-gayatri">Kavya Gayatri</a></p>
<p>Finally i gather all my patience to write a testimonial ... About this girl i could go on & on & on & write a longer testimonial than any of the above ... But i dont think i can single out anything about her to write in a testimonial ... I have met many ppl in college ... some move on ... some keep in touch ... some i ll miss ... some i wont .... This girl is totally something else for me ... I sure as hell wont miss her .... because she has always been there when i needed ... & iam sure will always be ... So i guess i cant say i ll miss her ... But i might miss coffee time :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sathwik-tulasi">Sathwik tulasi</a></p>
