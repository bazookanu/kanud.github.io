<p>i steeped into Bus that people said, go to BITS-Hyderabad. All telgu characters seemed all possible variation of parabola and hyperbola. Then i was a timid small town Bihari, so much scared of big city and it was so scary to be alone. A boy was standing few feet away from me, skinny like anything but attractive enough to catch my attention. Thick glasses, dark circles around little eyes 
made him look like a topper on the back cover of IIT magazine, who just got taste of freedom and JOCKEY was displayed just above waist. Later on the day, we both were forced to attend orientation; where our parents slept off after 2 minutes of tongue twister introduction by a south Indian professor. We both then looked out for chicks and somehow we reached Goa.


His movies and my chase of a good dual changed our way. But he is one of very few people in the world whom i will look upon any day. My trust and love for him is rock hard.There is no way i can say what he is to me, and i don't wish to find any.

Love

:)

<p>As I always say, I would have proposed him, had he been a girl ! 
My sidey for the past 3 years, his might be THE most organised and well kept room on campus. Quite famous for his 6-pack Abs which he proudly owns right from his early days, you have got to see them ! 
He's lovable, he's sweet, he's a true friend !
Many don't know this, but Girls in our MT2 batch were mad for him. He has the right attitude towards life. Though, sometimes slacky, he can pick himself up well. When people are struggling for marks(2k9 is a hell of a nerdy batch), his mindset of knowing the concept well is respectful. He means a lot to me, a true chemical engineer, who is always upright when any aspect of his branch is under speculation :-P
You'll do well in life :)
Signing off, I love you, Nawaz :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yash-patodia">Yash Patodia</a></p>
<p>So here it goes,Nawaz  the "coolest guy" I ever met in my life.
Always smiling face,enthusiastic,fun loving,social above all very intelligent with gr8 grasping power...he can crack any exam just by studying a ni8 before.(jus jokkking).The three yrs in my campus would have been incomplete without you.I hv spent innumerable  ni8s with him (dont take it otherwise) becoz its hard to find him during day time.He is always ready to help me out,always ready to accompany  me wherever i go.All the train journeys with him was awesome,playing cards with him was fucking awesome(although i never wanted him to win),ni8 out at curleys was fucking*fucking awesome, the sutta that i shared with him was infinitely fucking awesome and the trip to doothsagar ...baap re baap ....i can bet nobody would have experienced such a dreadful event.Thnx nawaz for all the awesome moments u have spent with me during three years but more awesome moments is yet to arrive in 4-2.
The first line of my testi was just to make u happy :P:P.....I know by now ur tears would hv been trickling on laptop...dont cry u have to bear me one more sem.
