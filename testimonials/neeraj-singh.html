<h1 class="page-title">Neeraj Singh</h1><p>Neeraj, NRJ, Bawa, Badshah Bhai, Hero, Thilwayiaa and KULTA. He is my bestest friend, I remember 1st time when I met you and you had told me to call u NRJ not neeraj (Aaj tak pooch rha hun bhai bata de please :P). He is very talented, one of the best designers on campus. He is a too good photographer (Banki photo kheechne se jyada khichwane ka shauk rakhte hain). He keeps his room very clean. He has his own way of dancing, now it is called kulta-dance (:P). For me, he is more than just a friend. If I have any problem, I just would go to his room. He is very caring, spiritually inclined, loving, supporting and awesome ( Kabhi Kabhi dude banne ki nakaam koshish karta hai :D :P:P). I just can’t imagine my college life without him. He was there every time whenever I needed him, supported me in every situation. Worries and tensions are not there in his dictionary (baki exams ke time kiski phate mein nahi aati :D).  Wish all the best for your future, may you have awesome life ahead.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-sharma">Akash Sharma</a></p>
<p>Chammiya, Kulta, R@#di, Kamina, Ise to jitni gaaliya do kam hai.. saale ko agar kuch karna hai, to hazaar ghatiya bahane banakar convince karne ki koshish karega.. in vain though, Par ek baat mein saale ne ekdum convince kar diya, ki dost ho to aisa. Neeraj, oh, oops, sorry, NRJ (:P) aisa banda hai jisne kabhi bhi, and I mean kabhi bhi, kisi bhi waqt khud ke bare mein nahi sochi. A true altruist, he knows it affects him sometimes, but he doesn’t care. He puts friends and family above everything else in his life. There is no one in our group jiski koi bhi baat nrj ko na pata ho. He knows every detail about everyone, takes interest in their lives, and tries to solve their issues as if they were their own. Yaar tu ladki hota to pakka main tujhe patata. Baaki to kya hai about him, fodu designer(Waves 2011 logo, waves permanent logo inhone hi banaya hai Shrimaan Amit Bhalerao ke sath), extremely shy, thoda sa fattu bhi hai, risks bahot kam leta hai, par chalta hai. Baaki apne group ka Chaawa hai apna NRJ Bawa, looks mein fodu, “maintain” bhi karta hai unhe.. I have learnt a lot from you neeraj, especially how to merge with people, you have been an inspiration in many ways. Bas saala ganda mooh mat banaiyo kabhi zindagi mein, bahot gussa aata hai dekhkar, aur hamesha touch mein rehna! May God give you the best life ever! Thanks a lot for those consultations, support and everything that u have done for me all these years in here. Convener bhale main tha, mera backbone to tu hi tha!
Machate rehna zindagi bhar! Cheers! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>

<p>neeraj jee.....came to know him spree'11 and later in spree'12 as well. As my "shrenik oswal"  experience tells me, he loves to flirt ( yaar dekh, sach toh sach hota hai :|  ;) ) and also to be a "dude" in front of other ppl that are around. he also likes to take treats from ppl, whatever mite be the reason. he's got very good sense of humour and loves to fight with amodh saxena and akash sharma most of the times that i've seen, though all three of them are very good friends along wid sagar birla ( who claims to have worked for purple patch :P  ). be it bargaining tips for workshop quotations, giving juniors their work properly, finding contacts, increasing no. of registratoins or fun in purple patch core committee meetings, all 3 of them have helped me very much to conduct workshops ( just 1 though :P ) during spree'12, stats of which i m not gonna mention :P. nrj was also a part of basketball sub committee ( a sport, which akash claims he has never seen neeraj playing,  :| ).  no doubt, he is one of the best photoshop pros our batch has seen(spree workshops poster was made in just a few hours  _/\_  ). well, that's all neeraj!!! thank u to all 3 of u.....u, Pandit and Mr. saxena (the guy on tennis court along wid  p***i in spree'11, remember??  :P ) for the help during spree'11 and 12. wishing u all best of luck for future!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>

<p>Bawa, nrj, kulta and a lot other names are associated with him. An awesome person to hangout with and an amazing friend. A skilled photographer and designer... we all are familiar with his designing skills through Waves 2011. A good dancer... mind blowing moves shown in zephyr 2011. Aur hindi ka prakand gyani...hindi ke saare todu fodu words rate hue h isne. But he has got a problem. He can't resist keeping his hand over other fellow's shoulder, gives a very wrong impression :P We have spent a lot of time together and it's  sad that you would be in PS next sem but we will be in contact. All the best bawa... tum dosto ke dost aur bawao ke bawa ho :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>This one is toughest. He met me at Kota station, I was like 'he is ok-ok type', then we had the same coach, same cab and finally same corridor. It was time that I had to accept the destiny. And the journey starts on the first day itself. We ganged and we banged, yeah :) The first week at campus itself says it all. One year passed, he changed from the person who wouldn't like to even hear a screw word to.. well, like all of us. Turned into a friend who will share the secrets (many a times of others also) and at the same time will hold them too (at least mine). He would always have a story or two for each and any incident possible. With second year, there came laptop. You want to know about any +mc update, ask him. We did so much masti in those two years, so many long night chats/gossips. Those years could not have been any better. And then the third year, the CDCs year, the so-called 'you-should-study' year. But like we were gonna change, things repeated themselves, neither you changed nor anyone else, except pongs. My all time whiskey-partner :) Murudeshwar trip with you was awesome (newly added to list). 
May be we don't have same PS-sem, but that's okay. We will have our time, that's toh sure hain :P Okay, I forgot to mention your "characteristics". Banda thoda shy hain, he may even ask you to join him for pee. Confidence bhi kam hain, same pinch :) But have a pure heart, a friend to treasure, free adviser, sometimes may try to convince you with any silly and lame excuses/explanations!!! Baaki pata nahi chehre se kya pyaar hain, he has a daily-three-times-facewash schedule. Toh stay in touch and keep machaying ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sagar-birla">Sagar birla</a></p>
<p>Neeraj aka Bawa aka Badshaah Bhai aka Kulta aka Akash (Chawl vaali Aunty) ki padosan.  I remember meeting you for the first time during our course registration in the first semester. You were an extremely ‘tameezdaar’ banda who asked pinki (mongi vaali) for a muffin in such a way which would make the Nawaab of Gwalior blush :D Ab voh sab ‘tameez’ kahan gaya ye toh hum sab jaante hai. You have a come a long way from ‘Mujhe ek muffin de di jiye please’ to well …….. (something things should better be left unsaid). Extremely creative, whether it is related to making new jokes on pandit or designing a poster or a magazine half asleep :D An amazing designer, I have often fought with people on how to design stuff using your works as a benchmark for creativity and ‘paarkhi’ vision. Hindi mein toh aap sarvagya hai, maha pandit hai, uske baare mein toh jitna bhi bola jaaye voh kam hai (1st sem ke aapke online path aaj bhi yaad karte hai chauhan sahab :D) You have always been my partner in crime. Be it making parody of songs en route to our locations on roadtrips or machaofying chudaap at epic levels in hostel. And how can I forget to mention the slogans we came up with at various audi events. I feel privileged and proud to say that I was there with you when you came up with the ‘kati famous kulta dance’. Neeraj we have come a long way from being just friends in the 1st sem to unloading all sorts of crap on each other till now. You are a great listener, a virtue many would kill for and you understand the problems people have. This isn’t goodbye(4-2 mein gande vaala chudaap macha denge be :D) at all but just an intermission in the our BITS journey. I am sure you will find your passion and work hard like always to achieve it. Kudos to you for being who you are and kudos to our friendship.
