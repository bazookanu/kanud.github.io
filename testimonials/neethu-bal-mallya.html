<p>Neethu Bal Mallya......This person is as unique as her name suggests.....I remember the first time I saw Balu, as we fondly call her...one of the first  Mallus I met on Campus....the moment I saw her...I knew she was different...forever smiling...her laughter is contagious..even small jokes can send her into splits!! A bit of a crazy psycho woman, 24 hrs hyper, 24 hrs excited..her room was our Common Room in our initial years..so clean and perfect, reflecting her meticulous and disciplined character! She is always there to help her friends...very sincere and trustworthy...we hve had our own disagreements, but that apart...she is te awesomest person I have ever met!!! Such a perfectionist, her way of doing things is impressive! I consider her, how to put it...a perfect example of Indian Beauty!!! Oh my...her dimples are soooooo cute!! Moreover her  attitude towards life will definitely take her a long way. So...Neethu Bal Mallya....you are one heck of a person!! Will definitely miss you...our group is soooo incomplete with out you....or rather you could put it like this you are the Fevicol that glues our group together!!! We love you Balu!!! Allways be the same!!!

<p>Hmm... lets see.. Neetu is nice, sweet, friendly, very helping, fun girl etc. etc. yadayada blah blah....everybody has already mentioned all of her good points so i wont. :P Neetu you are one of my best ENI buds. What would i have done without you? Who would have lent me their 'wonderful-organised-super neat' notes of "butcher's" classes?(your hand writing is beautiful) And those SUPER BOooooORING EIIT labs... you made those so much more bearable!! You are one of the sweetest, friendliest & most sincere girls on campus. And you never say no when someone asks for help. I never heard you talk bad about anyone. I'm so glad i got to know you and i think we became good friends in the last one year. Too bad this is our last sem together... i'll miss you :'( *sniff*  If you ever come to hyderabad, you MUST call me ok? :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/lasya-boddapati">Lasya Boddapati</a></p>
<p>Neetu, one of the most sweetest girls on campus. With the amount if hardwork and dedication she puts in studies, she deserves to be at the top of our batch! She is always ready to help with a smile. I remember the time when we had to submit our surprise microelectronics assignment in 3-1. I was not able to do it. I found her in the library solving it. At first i was a bit afraid to talk to her coz i didnt know her well. But when i asked her for help, she was ready with a smile. She saved me then. And she saves the whole batch everyday (with her awesome notes!!!). I dunno what the ENI batch wud do without her. She is the best student a professor can have. I admire her hardworking nature, her dedication hoping i can learn a bit from her. I wish her good luck so that she can achieve what she desires and reach the pinnacle of success. Good Luck Neetu!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>

<p>Neethu is always cheerful. It just never fails to bring a smile to my face. She's been with me for 5 years now and I am tired of it :P An amazing person to hangout with. Had so much fun fooling around especially during last waves :D Every time I  was bored I would just randomly ping her. Very good in acads and her notes are better than the text books.Wishing you all the best. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
