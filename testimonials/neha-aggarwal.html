<h1 class="page-title">Neha Aggarwal</h1><p>I remember meeting Neha in the first few weeks of campus and then I realized she is the chick I was in tuitions with in class 10th...:D...Neha is a bundle of energy!!...The most shrilling voice in the corridor has to be hers!!...:P...She used to be this rotlu gal, who used to crib about everything!!..:P..But now she has improved like hell!!( she has started taking this lite!!..:D)...We have had endless corridor talks since our first year( and will have lots more when i return from PS :P)...Sit with her for 10 minutes and you will end up having stomach cramps coz of laughing!!...:D...And ofcourse i have to mention how determined and dedicated a person she is!!( she gets up to jog every morning!!!!!! :D)...She is the person I meet every morning in the washroom!!..:P...We have had our share of amazing moments in campus!!...Once at night, we both saw a snake in the campus at very close proximity and I still crack up thinking about how she ran from there!!!...:D...Milte toh hum rahenge hi padosan!!( We are neighbours back home :P)...Have a blast in life!!...Take Care!!..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>Neha Aggarwal…the girl about whom I had heard soo much even before I met her… “arre neha wo ladki hai jo apne room k bahar baith k ro rahi thi coz ishita ki mumma chali gayi”… :P :P and since then I was so curious to see her…and then we finally met…I still remember that…those chubby cheeks….the pink water bottle….and a phone jo isko kabhi pata nahi chalta tha ki baj raha hai.. :P Since that day we became friends and now I cant even imagine my life without this stupid girl…neha is a real kiddo at heart and cannot live without talking…She always has some topics to blabber about…I wonder itne topics aate kahan se hain :O :O….She can do everything wrong, but still come up to u with a really innocent face and then u cant be angry even for a second…!!! :D :D
Aisa koi insaan ni hai jiski is ladhki ne li naa ho…..she can tease anyone and everyone…. We often have a session of scoldings which works for like a day or two...and then again we have our usual neha…teasing every1 back again…she is a fun person to be with…the biggest drama queen I ever sawww….kisi ki bhi acting karwa lo… :D 
She is highly disorganized :P ...no matter how hard she tries...room kabhi saaf ho hi nai sakta...aur laundry bag khaali hone ka to chance hi nai hai... :P i think YOUR room should be given the world's messiest room award.. :P

Neha I love youuuuu….and you will be missed soooo much…all that time spent with u…the dark secrets…girly crushes.. :P your LB talks, your IV talks and the endless confusion between the two which continues till date.. :P I hope u sort it out some day.. :P :P….our “mujhse dosti karoge” sessions...mission "make friends"...your continuous questioning about whether I can see your jogging effect…. your endless cries for marks and cg….your tantrums jo main poore sem se jhel ri hun… :P and aage bhi jhelti hi rahungi coz I really cant do without u… :( thanks for being there…:)
and yesss....how could i forget those sessions where me, anjali and nikhita provided u with the knowledge that no book can give u....the hidden meanings in every joke... :P you were a real dumb in this field :P :P but not anymore..thanx to such brilliant teachers like us...!!!

All the time spent with you will be cherished forever….even our fights..they have been fun at times…  :)

P.S we will be friends even after 15 20 years from now…my promiseee..!!!! :D :D and I will always love you… :-* :-*

<p>Very kiddish at times.. But definitely a girl with guts...She portrays herself to be tom boyish but very lady like by heart. Does what she wants to do and speaks what she feels like. She is what she is, there is nothing hidden..always gossip hungry >She has a shrewd sense of humour..One thing I hate abt her she doesnt appreciate m jokes...Cheers :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikunj-sharma">Nikunj Sharma</a></p>
<p>Well to start with i met her on day 1 in this college. N the first time i saw her, she was crying :P Initially she seemed  to be a person who talks a lotttttt and that eventualy turned out to be so true :P We started hanging out in 1-2 and then began the time of my life with all of us together :D All the trips whether to colva(our 1st trip together), bogmalo, no one killed jessica, gokarting, etc etc were great fun and these memories will be cherished forever. She is a real fun person to be with, who can just talk n talk n talk n you will never get bored with her around. But behind the childish  nature and innocence which seems to evident in her, she actualy is very matured and understanding. Her biggest passtime is to tease people :P and she has done that with each and every one in our grp like calling me "dabbbboooo" all the time,  teasing nikoooo :P, throwing divya in the dustbin, etc etc :D but its always so much fun to see all her nautankis :P and  m going to miss all of this a lottttt :( All the very best in life and may you get whatever you wish for. Love you loads :):*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>
<p>Neha Aggarwal (and people please take care of the "aggar" dere :P) is one of the most dynamic personality I have ever seen- she could be kidding with u in her childish voice rite now..and then discussing major personality disorders later.. Since the moment i met her in Bits hyd, she has been accompanying me all the years as my neighbour, it has been awsum talking with her about everything and nothing, seriously nehuu the times we spend bitching, cribbing and laughing have been just wonderful..for all those who dont know her..well heres a little heads up-be aware of the first impression u make, coz she notices more in you than you think..and thats what i admire about her..because whatever is going on she always understand the bottom line..and still is brimmed with that "m THE cool delhi chick attitude" even during her lows.. Its quite difficult to handle her at times ( we share some of the greatest fights in the history of Ch5 :D ) but once you are close with her, its amazing to see the honesty she has..seriously nehu not many people have the capability to say and accept what they feel..i love it in you..!!! I really cant say how much you mean, we have seen each other grow through the years...So heres to the late nite talks, the fights, the crying and the big laugh ..CHEERS..!! coz m gng to miss every bit of it..since its a lottt of memories from 1st day itself..!! Keep rocking as u do now..!! love yaaa.!! :) :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tapsi-dubey">Tapsi Dubey</a></p>

<p>She is the person who has been in my group through most of my lab courses. This can be just a shout out for that. And we'll probably be in a same group next year too. Certainly 
made bearing the labs a little easier :) The words for describing her - chatterbox, Drama Queen (yes, can't help but including them :P),quick witted, can enlighten the mood by the way she scolds people(!), has a good sense of humor, and knows how to get around things. Though she does seem haughty at times, but that's the way she is (nothing else I can say).
Anyways, may you have a Happy and a bright future :) All the Best.
PS: Now WRITE mine too :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>

<p>Neha!! you are a gem of a person. Really cute always so lively! I remember we both crying in our 1-1 ki ghar jaana hai and then as time went by I got to know you as this bubbly, sweet and this cute chick who always has something to say. It is so much fun talking to you. Hehe Your comments and the faces and the acting! Yaar mazaa aa jaata hai! You wear your emotions dekh kar hi pata chal jaata hai what you are feeling and you are frank about it. You love to irritate Nikhita! and I can never forget how sad you were to see me in her room when you thought that she had come! Yaar itni bhi buri nahi hoon main! You are one of the most simple and sensitive people I know. You notice the slightest things and care about everything. I love the way you keep taking Nikhita's case for everything she does, especially about her awesome dancing moves! Your dedication to jogging is indeed admirable and yes you have become thin! :P and you looked really good on your farewell! maanle!  Yaar it is so much fun being with you.  Always stay this same happy, lively, honest, genuine person that you are with this innocent charm that you have! :) Wishing you the best for your future! aur yaar abhi toh bahut time padha hai! Next sem bahut rona baaki hai! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>
