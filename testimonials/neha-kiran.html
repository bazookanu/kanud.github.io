<p>The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about her is how to top a course and my word she knows how to do that well!! She's a genius at work and a kid by heart. She's funny, intelligent, dedicated, awesome and I just love her sarcastic comments on any situation. She knows how to organize herself very well and that is perhaps one of the many reasons she is so successful at whatever she does. Her personality, work ethics and commitment will make her successful in whatever she does and I wish her a great and happy life and I will miss the times we spent together in the labs, classes and of course IC. Hope we can stay in touch for a very long time. All the best!! Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>Got to know her since the very beginning of college. She is a very frndly person and mixes up very easily. She is always ready to help( i remmbr coming to her few times asking for sumthn to eat when hungry :P). In 1st sem, I had a really great time with her. Our outing to old goa was so much fun n the whole day we had a blast :D, the pizza day that we had when we ran in the entire hostel to take orders from ppl...lol :D those days will always be in my memory and whenever il look back, il remmbr all the awesome moments spent with you.

<p>well... neha kiran.... very frankly... what i thought when i 1st met her...was that she is arrogant and has  a lot of attitude and awsnt approachable.. no offense...but over the time as i started interacting with her... i thought maybe i am wrong...  and it was right... she wasn't arrogant at least...and definitely...she was approachable... u have a very nice smile.... always keep smiling... a very dedicated and a studious typa girl.... which i respect about her.... wish i had these attributes... :P well leaving that aside... it was a nice experience having u as a friend.. and it'd be great if we keep interacting ahead as well.... :) i hope for a very bright future for u ... all the best for that... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankit-jain">Ankit Jain</a></p>
<p>  We joined on the same day in this institution .i  guess we r the last ppl who got into BITS from our batch (and also HP  :P )  . even though our id numbers are together we never had a group in common that is the main source where u can make (mainly girls :P ) friends so still 3-2 we never talked much . she is very talented in studies she knows how to study , when to study , what to study  to get course top _/\_.  sHe is very helpful ...without her class notes i could have got atleast 1 grade less than what i got (thanx for saving our grades ).she is the most laziest person i ever  come across (u should really buy a wheel walker :P ).she is very jovial . she used comment on ppl in the bio labs (even though she attended very less :P)  in her own style of sarcastic funny way . we spent lot of tym in mess ,IC, Nescafe, trips and all she really made a difference with her presence :D   . wish u all the best for ur future  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jammy-srikanth">jammy srikanth</a></p>
<p>Gracious and Elegant. These are the two words which pop up in the mind on seeing her. And though I don't hit it off with people easily, she has that quality which makes it easy. Apart from finishing on top of the courses (had to mention it), helpful, intelligent and knows what to do and say and when with great managerial skills (everyone says that!). And of course, the sarcasm,as is said, it's better then killing people :D
We have had some very enjoyable times, and I am definitely going shopping some day with you, without that other "girl" ( }:-] ). And we won't end up with just the shopping bags again :D
May you go and do what you want :) 
All the Best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>

<p>Neha! I have always had a blast chatting with this girl. Be it acads, gossip or anything for that matter. We have chatted about hair-straightening,  EEE CDC's, MOS, POM, FuFA... and so many other things.! I remember her getting amazing marks in CAS T1 ;)
I have had some memorable water cooler moments with her and the rest of the 340's! :)
Stay the same Neha, Don't ever change! Good luck for ur future endevours! :)

<p>Neha! Knew this amazing gal from the first year. First time I saw her; it was in the corridor, people were milling around her and talking and I thought " O, haughty chick" and slipped back into my room. Baseless assumption, I know :P . So, we've come a long way from then. How did we get together?  Through HP? That's another story :D . Don't remember anymore. 
We bonded over people-watching, cracking jokes which Srija used to not get, nenu meeku telusa songs :P. How we thought of the same dirty things! If you remember the pistons from the workshop video :P . Neha is  this cool, insightful, smart, confident girl who's totally comfortable in her skin. And of course has this amazing sense of humour. Makes these dinner time conversations so much more fun. And her memory! God! I forget my own experiences but she'll remember them! And even timetables, marks, grades from the first semester even, not only hers but even mine. And she has this cool way of simplifying my timetables. You have time for this, none for these, you can sleep here etc. Which of course, I can never figure out by myself. She has this clarity in the way she thinks and when she explains doubts and stuff, you'll end up wondering why and how did you ever think it was tough. And since the other testimonials have already mentioned this, I'm not going to talk about her efficiency in getting things done. :P. But I am going to mention this. Her Barney like way of photographing. ( Barney from HIMYM). it's been 3 years and I'm yet to see a photo where she does not look perfect. Us lesser mortals are left agape at how there are never these between expressions weird expressions caught on camera on her ridiculously photogenic face :P.
She uses this minimal space occupying algorithm kinda thing in her room. So much stuff and all lie in this tiny space to some corner leaving this spacious looking room. Did I mention this enviable ear ring stand she has. Again, I'm not mentioning her organizing skills. :P
And of course, these amazing times we've had together. The first waves ? KK? He pointed at us during cheliya cheliya, right? :D .Or the time when we were rolling around in the water and my phone got fucked? :P. The tank, the roof? We did go great heights in this college :P
Oh another story. Neha is the one who "gave"  me internet. When I was first got my laptop, I flailed around for weeks without internet not knowing the settings and shit. She finally took matters into her own hands and did all the shit and voila internet! I'm eternally grateful for that act of kindness in a situation of desperation. :D
I know our staying in campus dates never seem to coincide but I hope to have many more awesome moments, awesomer times. By many more, I mean ones spanning the length of a lifetime.
