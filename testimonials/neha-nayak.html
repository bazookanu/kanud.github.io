<h1 class="page-title">Neha Nayak</h1><p>Well, what do I say, a multitalented person, a great Compskie, a phodu in academics and really humble persona. Whatever I say is not sufficient to describe this wonderful girl. Incidently, she's also the first girl I met on campus. A soft-spoken and a great smile are something that would leave you in awe of her. An all rounder in every possible way. She has a solution to every problem...Truely, it was really great to have known you..!!! God Bless.!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>She is reallly a Miss Fantastic ! We interacted this sem only and i m glad i got to know such an amazing person. So beautiful, so sweet ! Truly for me, she are the smartest and at the same time humblest girl on campus. The number of times she says "sorry" in  a day! Neha, i really had a great time coding with you... speaking ill of teachers and laughing at our own stupid n silly mistakes. Also , I love your accent and your hindi :P
Be this way always... Keep in touch.. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/garima-agarwal">Garima Agarwal</a></p>
<p>NAYAK!! I know you always wanted to be called that so why not now! :) You are so cute and talented and really unpredictable! I remember initially when i had the image that you were just a library person, id num. '003' and all that but was so wrong.. I met you in drama club and i am sorry if i scared you in my first year! (i was wierd.. :P) I actually got to know the real you in this semester.. The Comp Net Assignments, PLCC study sessions and now preparation for compre would never have been so much fun without you.. You are really a very helpful person and you deserve to do great in future as you have worked sooo hard for it! I hope you achieve all your dreams! :) Worry less about stupid things and stop saying sorry.. :P Thanks for being such a nice friend! :) Keep smiling.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/avni-goyal">Avni Goyal</a></p>
<p>One of the most talented person in our batch in studies as well as in extracurricular s. The first girl to meet in the campus. She is the Queen of the Drama Club (even though I have never attended any of her performances :P).The only thing that I have got from the Wrokshop course is a Good friend like her. Wishing you the best.. Keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sachin-irukula">sachin irukula</a></p>
<p>I first met you in the drama club  and although I wasn't a regular member, you struck me as as very friendly and soft spoken .  I really got to know you in the third year, when we'd sit through CDC classes  trying to make sense of comp science and all that is weird on campus. I loved listening to your opinions about the people in our class (front benchers :X -yay! just a day more :D ).  Your an awesome actor as well as  one of the most intelligent, articulate & responsible people I know.  I truly am going to miss our interesting conversations, your pre-test meltdowns, my brief but amazingly fun time in the drama club and most of all, your  ipad (kidding :D.. although it is a part of you now ).  All the best for everything and I hope we stay in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayush-sanyal">Ayush Sanyal</a></p>
<p>Kayak, as I don't call her often enough, is one of my closest friends and confidants, and as I look back on the 3 years that seem to have sped by, I can't believe I won't see her around anymore. I still remember the awkward couple that were sitting together at the first drama meeting and making orca sounds to welcome me into the folds of fraandship. I am very happy I was able to light the candle of friendship with her. I cannot count the number of times we have bitched about the people on this campus, our mutual hatred for loud and crass, and our love for Arrested Development. The discussions we've had, the prithvi plays and LOTB, the chocolate lamington on my birthday :), your pre-exam paranoia, your paranoia in general (asking me to make sure you were alive on your first trip to vasco), your cupcakes - I now realise what you meant when you said how it's obscenely difficult to put into words the experience you've shared with someone you're actually close to. Anyway, Neha is the classic case of beauty with brains, and will surely go down in history for her contributions to computer science. Au revoir!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Neha is a person with golden heart and a comely smile. Very polite, sweet and helpful, she is someone who can be described as beauty with brains. Having got her as my MT1 chemistry partner, I was quite intimidated, but after knowing her over the years, I could find her as one of the sweetest persons on campus. Working with her has been so much fun, whether it was Lakme ppt for Pom or MT2 or the boring numal classes. I could count number of times when while meeting in corridors, we have bitched against BITS system. I wish her all the best for her future!!! Always keep Smiling :) :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Neha you are truly a wonderful freind and it's always fun to listen to you, more so, when the tests are around the corner :P .Jokes apart, you are an intelligent,precise thinker and one of the most caring persons i know.I have always valued your opinions about anything related to studies
(cs stuff) but on TV shows huh!, arrested development is definitely not my thing.I admire your spirit,not getting tired after attending three marriages in a row!(i would be sleep walking after the first), or doing the amount of python code in a day, an average coder would do in a month!.One can only treasure having a freind like you.Keep in touch and all the best to you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raunak-sharan">RAUNAK SHARAN</a></p>
<p>There is nothing about her which you cant appreciate or admire ...i mean she is so adorable , down to earth , organised and very prompt when it comes to helping; especially when you have hit the panic button !( you know what i mean :) )She has been a wonderful friend and someone whom i can bank on ! Nobody can greet you with that perfect smile and talk with the most innocent demeanor. She is one of the very few people who has an aristocratic way of not just living but also working ! Hats off to her systematic way of making notes and arranging papers ! I have learnt that from her . One of the very few people i know who are crazy about stationery . She is the drama queen yet so not one in the real picture . Perfection, hard work and intelligence are the warp and woof of the fabric called Ms Fantastic who will make it big in the big apple of computer science , wont be surprised if she comes up with what might be called as iberry ! I know i will be one of those first ones to try to it out ! cheers :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>
<p>Cute,intelligent ,multi-talented and at the same time down to earth.I came to know you through our time spent in labs together.Breaking our heads over  the circuits in DECO labs ,cursing Shankar, to  trying to make things work in the electrical labs...its been a learning as well as fun experience.I really appreciate how you manage all your stuff and time.A really caring and friendly person who never says no to anything.I am really glad to have known you.Have a great future ahead...I hope to keep on bumping into you every now and then :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/meghna-mehta">Meghna Mehta</a></p>
