<p>Konnichiwa!
Neha Repal - My first friend on campus since Day 1! Damn - Could never ever come up with a nickname for her! 
Has been one of my bestest friends on this journey so far. Have had the most hilarious moments laughing with her. One of those few people who gets the witty jokes in a split of a second and we can laugh together and snigger for ages, remembering an old joke after a long time. She is a very helpful person. Anime crazy. Loves Orange. Plays great badminton. I have had epic moments with her which I shall cherish forever.
Stay the same! Never change!
Arigato for everything!
Cheers,
=)

<p>Friends since our first year, then PS mates - Neha's surely a very special person! She lightens up the mood with her humour, and is always in a sporty and fun mood. She plays badminton most evenings, fiercely defends Anime over everything else, and always forgets to bring her phone with her. :D Its been wonderful knowing you, Nepal, have a great future ahead and always, always stay in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Neha-chan!!! :)
One super-awesome powerhouse of fun,energy,enthusiasm and endless laughs!
Have known you since school but never knew you had this orange side :P 
Oh! the long discussions on the changing anime, the eternal battle between my inuyasha and your beloved naruto, the attempts to converse in japanese, and all those anime like expressions :) ,the updates about our friends back home, the shocking jokes that still haunt me :P, the crazy talks and the long walks, and sittin on random benches on a beautiful evening with my coffee and ur Dew :P!!! Oh and how could i forget, those thankfully short-lived awkward moments when we were dance partners :D !! Damn! goin to miss much more than dis, goin to miss YOU! All the best for a future as wonderful as you! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
<p>A person who always "YO"s to everyone and likes to be "YO"ed back... A fearless and clueless person.... "An extreme enthusiast, a treasure-chest of humor, has an unimaginably kind heart, extremely dexterous and a perfectionist in what she loves" is how I would like to put Neha into words... One of the greatest ANIME fans I have ever come across in my life... Never allows any person to say any damn thing about Anime (Argues them with a "YA-HA" :P)...  A very straightforward person who is clear on her decisions .... An extremely sincere girl who sits on the first two benches even for boring classes... Passionate about Japanese (I remember the small chat we had in Japanese :P)...  She is unique in her own way and always wants others to be happy.... Kindof relieves tensions of other people by doing stuff as she likes... I remember her offering flowers to everyone around just to spread joy (A rare quality)  which brings you right at the center spot of the show... ... Also a very fun person to be around as she comes up with some most exciting and hilarious jokes...  Never is found stressed up with anything.. A happy-go-lucky and an easy going girl who is working "aramaat" always... :) :D You are really such an awesome person.  Oh.. and how would I forget that day when you just fell asleep outside the library  in the middle of the conversation after I guess the BAT exam (was it ?) and we 3 (me, anuva and rohan) left you there and ran away.. :P (What a moment !!! :P) ...  Also thanks for the treats that you have given me without any reason.. :P... You are such a jovial person to hang out with... I am so glad to have a great friend like you... :) I believe that you will have a fantastic future ahead... Arigato!! for being such an awesome person who gave me an awesome friendship which I will cherish for the entire life... :) Finally a "YO" to you... :) :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>Her infectious laughter is the first thing you’ll probably notice about her. She is bright student who gives her 100% in whatever she wants to do. Hates physics like me :P. She is crazy about badminton (and maggi :P). She was the one who introduced me to the world of anime. Still fondly remember how much I loved ‘Itazura na Kiss’ and ‘Maid sama’. She is a practical, level headed person who is fairly good at judging people. I know I can always confide in her and hope to get sound advice. She usually minds her own business. There was a time when she didn’t even know the names of all the people in her corridor :P.  And how I can forget those vivid descriptions of her dream sequences. I still wonder how she manages to recollect them. I will always cherish all the moments we spent together and hope that we will stay friends forever. Love you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-dhoot">Shruti Dhoot</a></p>

<p>YO! I met this girl pretty late, 2-1 I think and really didnt interact much with her untill we had our Economics classes together. A huge anime fan, she re-introduced me to the joys of Anime and I screwed up so many exams cos of my addiction to it. I squarely blame you for that, Neha!
She is exceptionally brilliant and her wit knows no bounds, making us split with laughter. I love her chilled out persona and her badminton skills are really commendable.
Here's to Neha-chaan. Knowing you are a pleasure :)

<p>Hey neha!!...you are one of a kind...she is one of my first friends in the campus. She is smart practical and a fun loving person and plays superb badminton (she has even tried to teach me!!). She is extremely sincere and hardworking..she loves her friends and is very protective about them!! I have enjoyed arguing with her (making fun of her anime)...and i'll never forget her dance during ganesh chaturthi :P!!...i wish her all the best and hope that we always remain friends!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-dighe">Priyanka Dighe</a></p>
<p>Neha is one of the craziest and most enthusiastic people I know. Being with her in EPS and MT1 labs were fun experiences. I won’t ever forget the crazy things she and Niharika did in physics labs, especially the talk about putting up a show :D She continued the streak in chemistry and biology labs with even the teachers having to smile at her actions. Even otherwise I have always had a good time whenever I have been with her (Remember the times we played badminton in the hostel lawns? You were so competitive yet still fun. Or when we tried going for jogging together in the morning? Well, it failed miserably but still was a great experience :D And that Art of Living course wouldn’t have been that much fun had it not been for you) She is witty and always lights up the atmosphere with her jokes and comments. Wish you all the best for the future. And never change ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>Neha is one ever enthusiastic and chilled out person. She hates “brinjal” and its too much fun to see her reacting (or overreact rather :P) when I say that :D A huge fan of anime (especially Naruto) and loves Japanese language… She is highly offended if u say anything wrong/bad about anime :P She is a very good badminton player. She used to be hardly seen outside her room till last sem, except for classes (did u ever go to mess Neha? :P) Sleeps quite early (compared to BITS standard) and needs complete darkness to sleep.. Has ‘I am confident’ type motivational thoughts written down in her room… She is always seen around with her bag… Has very contagious laughter and you end up laughing just by seeing her laugh even if u dint find her joke that funny :P Can never forget those “machchar photos” (I still don’t know why they were named so) with u namrata and gargi. . :D Studies well.. Enjoys life… And makes people happy :) Be the same funny, jovial, cool person that you are… <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>

<p>You r the perfect example for quote"Happy Go lucky" ,always happy happy to do any thing either its a assignment or giving flowers to others during class hours , i had never met a girl , who greets others thru 'YO-YO' and sm's like 'YA-HA'  :P. Calm ,composed , not interested in others activities are your best features.Enjoy each and every moment of your life the same way no matter wat happens, ,have a great future ahead :)))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-jaini">Aditya Jaini</a></p>
<p>where do i begin? first thing about neha is the way she greets you, 'yo!' in the first few minutes of the conversation, odds are, shell crack a joke or two and laugh her shrill maniacal laugh and make your day! but wait ladies and gentlemen, theres a lot more than meets the eye as far as this jolly girl goes. while all my other friends are my reasons to take 'lite' and chill out, neha is a notch too different. shes the one person who asks more than you can give, really really push yourself thus putting her on the list of people i'm glad i met. she is the only person on campus that has the true sports person spirit! she has taught me a thing or two. you got it dear! we'll show'em next year! she has a great sense of humour! my fellow wodehouse fan! one can pass her room and hear the infectious laughter(why, its an epidemic!) and laugh like a maniac yourself, and then it just another day in my corridor! birthday party or anything, shes there at the heart of it all and shes rocking it! imma miss you a lot! all the best for your future :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>

<p>YOYO! :-D Saw my gtalk history recently and all i found were 'stud' and 'yoyo' references.
The only person i know who actually can standup and defend the thing they call 'anime'. She's my "Sheetal bhabhi", "Delhi Belly", "2  peas" friend. :-D

Had such a blast with you in PS that i almost forgot we used to play Badminton way back in 1-2! (You'll beat me someday dont worry. Keep trying. :-P)
Neha- Take a truckload of care of yourself and keep up that awesome positive attitude. Its your biggest asset!

Wishing you loads of luck for life. Just promise me that the next time we cross paths, you will actually say something other than just a half hearted HI!! :-)

PS: Jai Maharashtra! :-D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maanit-mehra">Maanit Mehra</a></p>
<p>I have always liked the company of easy-to-go and non-stop chit chatting types and Neha is perfectly that. A very big anime fan. The two occasions when we need to work together have been completely contrasting experiences. While the Fantasy Quiz in Quark was really enjoyable and fun-filled, the MuP experience was full of anxiety and tension. You have an infectious optimism about you. Never lose that and your smile. All the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>"Mirror mirror on the wall; who is the cutest of them all?" Ans.- Repal Repal Repal!!!!! :P You are the cutest person. So adorable and helpful and yet so smart!!!

You are one of the persons with whom one can spend hours and hours chatting and it'll still be interesting at every stage!!! Please keep playing Badminton!

<p>Yo Negha ! :D I've known this girl, or should I say 'little girl' since a long time. Back in fourth standard doing the same scholarship classes and meeting in various other competitions, we hail from the same place - *Le Mulund :P I didn't actually know her well before coming to BITS, but the impression I had was of a genius person. Well, that impression still continues along with many new discoveries. She has the 'Alice in Wonderland' kinda look most of the time. She's like a sweet little girl lost in the infinite universe :D Whatte awesome time we had during our PS1 !! A big big big anime fan who takes it personally when me and Maanit talk shit about Anime. Yeah, they are examples of low FPS lazy cartooning :D One peculiar thing about her is her wild laughter. OMG ! Even if I had just stopped whining I would get along laughing just looking at her laugh so hard. Remember when you showed me that toilet scene of some anime and we laughed out so hard with earphones plugged in and created a scene :P Hahaha, I still laugh remembering that. A truly hard working and honest person. Will give her 200% to any work she's taken up. I loved hitting her with new puzzles everyday. And she solved them like a kid every time. Plays baddy as well. She's the one who wants to do it all. It feels awesome to have a friend like you Neha. Stay the same foolish person and rock the world :D Cheers ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
