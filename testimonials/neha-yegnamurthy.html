<h1 class="page-title">Neha Yegnamurthy</h1><p>Neha, one of the most quiet person i met, but kudos to me even she started talking... jokes apart, a lovely and innocent gal, who is so true and sharp, I seriously adore her honesty and happy-go-lucky nature, be it the jogging session, or the talks we used to have at any random places, we have discussed it all, time passes by and I still can't believe that we will have only 6 months left with each-other, she is a brainy person who cares a lot for her family, an awesome singer who is very fond of her guitar and stationery things (because she is crazy about them as well)... love ya.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>I have known Neha since our time in FIITJEE. She's absolutely lovely to talk to. One can never get bored when she speaks. During one of these conversations, we found that we have been in the same schools since kindergarten in Mumbai, then high school in Dubai, senior secondary at FIITJEE and now we are both dualites at BITS. Quite amazing! She's very good at music and I remember seeing some brilliant paintings by her as well. She's really very gifted. She has a wonderful music collection and one of the best DC nicks in my opinion - Vrishchika :) Though she is quite reserved and doesn't speak to many people, she cares about her friends a lot and I consider myself fortunate to have known her. Hope we land up in the same place again :) All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Neha.. The quitest person of our corridor, with a big innocent smile. Infact most of my mornings start waving at her from a distance. Major part of our interaction started with Nettech . Neha is someone who does what her heart says.She is a passionate girl who is an epitome of self control. Totally opposite to me, patient , thoughtful and sweet introvert Neha baffles me by her self control. A firm believer in abnegation (proof : she left her laptop at home :P ) , Neha is also a good guitarist and an artist. She is a patient listener to my stupid jokes. . She listens to them with a unique sweet smile. I remember confusing my cousin with Tamil words sitting down with you. :D  It was real fun. Then the long chats in Preeti's room during which you would just keep laughing.. my wild fancies ..and the way you would laugh at them . Life has been really great with good friends like you. Will miss you a lot . Stay in touch . All the best for your future :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>Statistics say that there are innumerable 'Nehas' in India, five in our campus itself !! Whatever it is, She is the 'first' and probably the last 'Neha' i have ever been so dearly close to !Okay  now, forget the attention seeking start-up line!! :P Its true that she is quiet but penetrate a little deeper and you' ll find an entire 'supporting system' waiting out for you, whenever u need her ! :-D But folks, if u want to crack a friendship with her, these are the following Dos and Donts that one must STRICTLY adhere to:
(1) Dont get even remotely touchy with her, even though you might have the purest of affection pouring out for her! Rather maintain a hand's distance from her ! :P Thats when she ll  consider making a move!;)  (2) Dont let any form of dirt linger around the two of you ! She is a cleanliness freak ! And I kinda admire her for that! :-D Give her space and let her talk ! Yes, she IS quiet but after the ( sometimes prolonged ) silence , her well chosen thoughtful words can  make ur world seem a shade wiser the next day and i mean it ! :-D
Jokes apart , She has been one of my most consistent and loyal friend, which is a big deal to find , especially in a dynamical campus like this ! Also, she has contributed towards increasing the share of a large variety of music in my lappy ! I am glad that our taste in music evolve synchronously. Also, very few would be knowing she has a knack in playing commendable guitar! I will cherish the days when you accompanied me on the guitar while I played "Country roads" on the keyboard ! It was awesome fun !!:-D Also, people who think that she has an 'innocent' smile should be aware that she is one person with whom one can talk not-completely-innocent stuffs at any length and you may even get enlightened with a lot of gyan in the process !
All in all, I have adored you for what you are ! You mean a lot to me ! Hope that we remain in touch forever ! :-D :-D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gargi-biswas">Gargi Biswas</a></p>
<p>One of the most gentle and unique persons I have met. She is very sweet, patient, a little shy, a very interesting and creative person. Also a very sensible and logical person. She is big fan of music (plays the guitar and sings beautifully). A very down to earth person who is eager to learn and try out new stuff. We came pretty close during PS-1. I remember how you used to avoid wearing salwar-kameez (girlish dresses) and the walks and talks we used to have when trying to find a place to eat. I will really miss those walks. I love your simplicity. Stay like this forever. May you get whatever you desire…love u loads Neha!! ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>
<p>nEHA.. the most unique one of all my friends.. She is like a huge glacier.. when you look at her from far, you’ll see a rather quiet, calm, untalkative , peaceful person, but as you approach nearer, and break that thin crust, you dive into a world full of life and colours... A true appreciator of music, a typical touch-me-not, gets all ruffled up when you mix up south-indian states or use sms english or talk non-stop near her ear :P :P... likes to do crazy things...and ya! cleanliness freak! :P.. a cheerful, fun and an extremely interesting girl veiled in a shroud of quietness , to keep herself aloof from the daily humdrum affair of life.. The one thing I like about her the most is the sense of maturity she has .. I loved the long talks we had on so many varied topics... the deep, meaningful thoughts which she has on almost every topic on earth , makes one believe that she sees life from her own kaleidoscope.... Cheers to the wonderful and sweet memories we spent together.... have a great future ahead! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>
<p>i dint want 2 write testimonials cuz its  so cheesy and so outdated n blah.. but i cudnt resist writing one for her .I think neha is the only person on campus i feel so friendly with and so homely with .Remembering the 1st day,when she recognised me in the long queue in ic, i dint knoe I would adore this person so much! apart from divya, whom i must realllly  thank for helping in getting 2 knoe you I found really common things among us, like , starting learning guitar at the same time which you have definitely been doing greaaaaat (I think I have just listend to your 'iktara',) . Neha is one of the really cool and sweetest persons i have known who also reads weird stuff like Oedipal complex!! And though we don't talk a lot, (yaaaayy!! i hav ma cdcs wid u next year!!)  every time after talking to her I really feel  good and m like I am with one of ma oldest friends and   m like super haaapy. Shes not like the usual people, cramming and getting tensed b4 exams, but borrowing your guitar and doing really cool stuff.Seriously, there is no doubt you have great career in music with the kind of passion you have.And i knoww you will have a great future .unless you meet divya again and get sucked  into her web of Rajnikanth movies!!  It was awesome fun knowing you!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shahzarin">shahzarin</a></p>
