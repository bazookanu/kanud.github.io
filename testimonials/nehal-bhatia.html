title: Nehal Bhatia

<h1 class="page-title">Nehal Bhatia</h1><p>If you happen to meet Nehal in class ( where i first met her) she will seem (and she is) to be that ideal student for which every teacher longs for. Look at her notes or answer sheets you will have one question from where does she get time to write with multi color pens. She can go without food during exams living on fruit juice (Howwwwww????) 

It's not just acads which she manages. Being a member of Nirmaan and Abhigyaan she has done a lot to bring in the change in the society.

One of her best qualities is that she is ready to help anyone anytime.Be it acads or any other matter she will listen to you patiently.Dare you ignore her, she will make sure you repent it :P. She is a delicate darling as she can cry on seriously stupid things :P :P ( I knw you will kill me for writing this :P )
Once she starts talking, no one can stop her. She adds her own charm to everything she does.The girl who is fearless and voices her opinion and stands by it. She has her own sets of rules which she breaks for no one. And how can I forget, that she is great at writing beautiful poems (gal you should seriously publicize your blog). Apart from her super loving, ultra caring and extra-ordinary cool nature she is a perfect blend of beauty and brains.


I have enjoied every second in your company. Be it watching Love Aaj Kal to any other movie or just aimlessly roaming in Panjim or having late night walks to cribbing about things to gossiping to attending boring lectures to studying together in 1-1 and 1-2 to cooking Ching's to dancing like mad during any DJ night or concert to celebrating our success to motivating each other. Love you loads Nehal <3 <3 <3 !!! Always be the way you are :)

<p>If you think about nehal the first thing that comes to your mind is acads, CG, attending all classes and topping courses. But keeping that aside she's a wonderful person to hang out with and spend time. She has many personal morals that she so strictly follows and preaches :P . She's funny, smart, geeky, chatty, confident, attentive and certainly understands a person very well. She a very down to earth person and ready to mingle with people, she loves kids and maybe that's why sincerely attended each and every abhigyaan session. She can win any person over with her smile and childish attitude. It hardly takes anytime for her to get to know a person. She talks a lot and my god she speaks really fast, sometimes you don't understand what she's saying.Her notes are even better than the text books :). She is a great writer and you'll just love reading her poems and short stories and if she ever becomes a writer she will achieve great heights. Moments spent with her are truly valuable and memorable and with all my heart wish her a good life and a bright future. I'll certainly miss you and always remember you in my life!! You've been a great friend!! Thnak you :) Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>met Nehal for the first time in PS1 (though knew about her as the 8 pointer girl who had taken Chemical as a dual :P).. and strangely it didn't even take a week to become friends with her because of her friendly and talkative nature.. had some great memories at PS peeling of Jatropha seeds, crushing rose petals, the "Nehal Bitiya" daily episode :P etc etc… is a huge attention seeker… and still feels she is in school which is evident from her notes… is very caring, kind hearted and a very good friend to have… always keeps smiling no matter what… easily gets upset and then gets back to smiling… writes very good poems which sometimes sound childish because they rhyme… is a kid at heart.. talks a lot.. is always the first one to break the silence and then doesn't stop :P  …. she does know how to enjoy life and is exceptionally good at acads… Thanks to PS that we became such good friends and collected loads of memorable moments which will last for a very long time.… Wish you loads of success for your bright future and always keep smiling!!! do stay in touch…<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>Nehal, my longest known friend-girl in campus, is a class apart from all my friends. A huge heart , a mesmerizing smile, a sense of care, all bottled up in a jar of hard work. Im thankful to her for introducing me to Gargi and Nups, while she would be cursing me for introducing Sandy to her :P. Jokes apart, You were a great force in shaping my life the way it is now.. The long walks, the endless talks, the library hours, the yellow rose flowers, the awesomm outings, your shreiking shoutings, the poems you wrote, what a friendly note!, I'll cherish them all... We have shared some aweosme times, and the tiny little boat of our friendship, despite being troubled by storms of fights and misunderstandings, has managed to keep its mast high, . Three cheers to the majestic bond, three cheers to our friendship...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Nehal bhatia has been my neighbor since first year and surprisingly we never talked for like 2 years!!! And quite weirdly we clicked while in PS1 in lucknow. They were good times. All we did was 2 months timepass. We used to hangout in huge chemistry labs. I guess those two months we stayed together and talked so much that it was enough to catch up for past two years we ddin talk. About Nehal, she is a freak for studies. She is super dedicated, super sincere student. She is the kind of girl every parent dreams of. She has been a really good friend of mine and still is. Also, if I need anything in the world, I just have to knock on her door.  Cheers! All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Nehal's work ethics scare me. Although that's not the first thing I ought to say her about her, but her sincerity and dedication deserves mention upfront! One of my better female friends in campus, she is been very helpful and nice. Nehal is a sort of person who is always cheerful and happy ( I guess all focused people are happy). 
She has always taken extra initiative when it came to organizing chemistry outings. It was because of her and Abheek's efforts that everyone in chemistry formed a cohesive group so quickly. A chemistry enthusiast, movie lover and a really wonderful person. You deserve all the success you desire!! All the best

<p>who has 100% attendance.. who is the fav student of all teachers.. who is the most talkative girl in chemistry.. well , the answer for all of them is nehal bhatia. i think i have to give her a big applause for attending all the lecs and i think she personifies sincerity. even though she gives nerdy vibes , she is always fun to hang out with . i still remember the innumerable gossips and nonsense chats we had in and out of CE labs. you were always a good friend ,not hesitating to offer help. well, i think its routine to mention her hardwork , determination and that never say die attitude. she is very caring and is sensitive towards her friends . i wish u enjoy watever u do and achieve greater heights . always keep in touch  :) :)   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>Nehal is a person who can make even the most reticent people enjoy gossip. She is very studious and attends every single lecture, despite this she is a fun person to hang around with. Also teasing her (especially just before a test) is fun :) I hope that she continues on as she is and smiles brightly as ever. All the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/udit-dewan">Udit Dewan</a></p>
<p>ONCE UPON A TIME IN GOA......
I still remember how nishant introduced us to each other. The journey of our friendship began with her beautiful smiles and my evil grins :P which one fine day converted into a short and sweet conversation and later grew into long discussions. Discussions of crushes (ob I dont listen to any one else :P) , acads(her fav topic :P),and all random stuff which one can think of. Nehal(aka missfastfwd) is sweet (not always :P), caring and helpful person. She helped me grow as a person by working on my public speaking skills. I still remember how she forced me to read novels (obviously nahin padhe :P), made me practice my part a hundred times before TRW presentation (patient enough :P) etc etc. Along this journey we also had innumerable fights(main hun toh jhagde toh honge hi :P) on silly topics such as my crush saga(s), her constant bakbak(BOLO BOLO KUCH TO BOLO), etc etc. A lot has changed now, even though we don't talk to each other much still we are good friends. I wish her good luck for her future. Take Care :)

<p>Miss Organic Chemistry Genius. What else do I say? She's been a constant inspiration for me, making me study and helping me do my best, till I creep out from under her watch and start slopping it out again. I don't know how I'd have survived through 9 hours a week in that wretched lab without her! With her smiling face and scary nails, her pretty rings and Hermoine-Granger-tendencies, she's one of the most unforgettable memories of my Chemistry year at BITS. Here's to another year of Chemical with her! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayeesha-khanna">Ayeesha Khanna</a></p>
<p>Nehal!!!!! :-D :-D :-D ..........Everyone starts their testimonials from how they met each other and how their friendship developed ! Speaking in those lines, I should have befriended Nehal from the very first day of my life in BITS as she was my neighbour ! But we practically didn't become friends till the end of the first year! Truly speaking, I was scared ! :P Scared of confronting her and talking to her! Why? Because, friends, when she starts her verbal express, its like a sooooper-dooooper  'Rajdhani train'!By the time ,I could gather myself into comprehending the first sentence that she uttered, her train had reached her destination ! And after all the confusion, even if i managed to speak few words in hindi, then there was always this fear of saying it wrongly and she doesnt hesitate to correct you !:P But once I had overpowered this fear of mine, there was no turning back to befriend this girl with brimming energy and a beaming smile always ready to lift your mood ! Nehal, because of you,I am no longer dyslexic in understanding fast speakers :P  Also,I am confident of my hindi-grammar now, thanks to those relentless efforts to make them right ! :) With you, Nishant and party, I got a glimpse of an entirely different flavour of India and it was damn fun! I miss those days when all of us used to be together and be constantly bickering about some stuff happening in the campus ! I remember the time when I revealed my 'IIT-B-affair' to her, she looked at me with a completely new perspective ! It was like she got just what she wanted, somebody we could second our mental stated with from time to time regarding our 'lovey-dovey' issues ! Few things that I really love about Nehal are that she can always get up on time (:P) ,she will attend all the classes she can and motivate me to do so if i am drifting away from my path,, she has this thing about making morally correct decisions all the time , in her own ways and if you don't follow her, she can pester you until you thought it was a better idea if you plainly followed her ! She is transparent ! :) She gets angry quite easily( because of her ethics) but her anger is short-lived and she also gets happiness out of little gestures ! She does not keep anything to her heart for long for the greater good :) Whenever we talk, hours become seconds and we don't realize how we actually covered talking about all the girls in the campus, the state of affairs in Lucknow or her brother qualifying each and every olympiad in existence ! Life without you would have been a shade dull here!
Thanks for being there, whenever I needed you, Thanks for your little little frank advice on various stuffs.Thanks for taking an extra effort to correct me whenever u thought it was justified!! You are close to my heart !! Hope we bond well in the coming year and well beyond that too.. :) Love you !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gargi-biswas">Gargi Biswas</a></p>

<p>A girl with ever brightening  cuteness and a woman with a huge heart. A chatterbox when you want to listen to something, actually always a chatterbox.Shows unusual and unexpected courage in hard times, and most of what I admire is her amazing patience and her willingness to hang on to her beliefs, and to people. Stronger than she thinks she is, smarter than she shows she is , and throws  a pure heart for whatever she'll do. Just shine on... with a smile just as bright as the sun...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-nalawade">Pranav Nalawade</a></p>
