<h1 class="page-title">Neil Dhruva</h1><p>I have met very few people as well mannered as him. His humbleness, intelligence and helping nature is truly commendable. He is a passionate programmer and has a great knowledge of movies and TV shows. A good friend and respectable person.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Few people fit into the word "gentleman" as perfectly as Neil Dhruva does. Very polite and silent by nature, he exudes a certain calmness about him. For me as far as Economics academics are concerned, he is the "Mr.Dependable". He always has time to clear doubts patiently, even if it is asked right before an exam. He loves programming and is brilliant at it. All in all a very humble, helpful and a good friend. My best wishes to you Neil for the future ahead :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>Easily one of the best people I've ever met. Neil's sense of sarcasm, his reticence makes him an amazing person to spend time with. Its startling how he can pull off education and all that television. His programming is going to take him a long way in life, and he'll still be as humble and soft spoken as he is today. All those times at Bogmalo, or studying holed up in his room making fun of people have been epic days indeed.This ever-inebriated Gujarati has made campus life truly memorable. Silicon Valley will just be one feather,... in his feather-bed. Keep spreading joy and staying whipped, you insignificunt :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Neil, it has been a pleasure knowing you. We met in the epic TRW group that we had and since then we have talked random crap and dude, it has been fun. You were the guy who would just keep smiling and nodding to everything anyone said (GMJ was our leader). You are one of the cutest and most soft spoken person I have known. You are witty, smart, intelligent and really shy.haha! A great programmer who has promised me gifts :P since he is going to get all rich and shit. Your infinite patience while listening my rona dhona at odd times has been amazing. You are a really helpful guy and one of the most genuine people I know. Hoping that you would always be happy and maybe keep in touch. Wishing you the best in life. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>
<p>The perfect gentleman - which is kinda weird, 'cause he's a Gujju. Brilliant, humble, sincere and soft-spoken. Also, sarcastic & reticent. My AAOC courses’ savior. Neil has incredible patience as a teacher and insane cheese-consuming capacity. I got to know him well only in 2nd year (till which time I used to think his first name was Dhruva) and its been insane fun having the most pointless discussions with him while studying for exams ever since. When he’s not putting up with Harsha’s PMS, he’s creating epic code and that’s definitely going to take him places – unless his grades don’t get him there first. It’s a pleasure to have known you for these 3 years & I hope you’ll deign to stay in touch. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Neil is very intelligent and always comes up with the most insightful comments in the classroom discussions. His talent at computer stuff is remarkable and I'm sure he's going to do wonderful things in the future. He is very friendly and pleasant mannered. His sense of humour and effortless sarcasm are worth a mention and it's always a pleasure talking to him. He is very sincere when it comes to work and serious stuff and that makes him the perfect guy to have on your team. It has been very nice knowing you. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>

<p>The humblest guy I have ever known in my life. It is still sometimes difficult to believe his innate human-ness. His degree and sense of Sardonic commentary is immaculate. The perfection of his comic timing is the epitome of his intelligence. The ultimate hardworker - which you can tell with the amount of notebooks he has bought & filled up! His notes were a key to many a success for a lot of fellow buddies. (Sure Eco guys would agree with me!)
CS pro - Man, you freak me out with your knowledge. It was him because of whom I was fortunate enough to become a fellow GSoC-er. He has saved me in my studies - on more than 1 occasion. Thanks for that man!
An "avid" drinker - Enough Said!
I have spent some of the epic days in your room while studying or discussing random thoughts!
He is one of my very close friends and a true gentleman.
Man, it has been a real honour to have known you. I wish you the best for your future & I hope you fulfill all your dreams in your life - because you deserve them!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>

<p>Neil! It's hardly been a semester since I first properly interacted with you, and I've got to say it has been pretty awesome everytime I have. Calm, quiet, humble, hard-working, intelligent, and funny - easily one the most perfect people around. It's amazing how you juggle academics, coding, all the TV shows, and still have time left for some extra fun! I guess reclusion played a big role in why we never really met in the first couple of years here, despite having all the same courses and my living right above you. Sorry for the constant bed-shifting and keyboard/mouse dropping at odd times; I'll wait for your tap-dance sessions next year in CH1 (btw, we got CH1, huh?! :D) If only I'd known you earlier, I could've maybe moved up a grade or two in the CDC's, but that hardly matters now that we're "Masters" of Economics anyway :P I know for a fact you're gonna ace all courses in next year, given your CS prowess and the excitement about 'showing the muggers where they belong'. So good luck for that! Dude, it has been amazing knowing you and spending time with you, and I really hope that it doesn't end with college. So here's looking forward to many more good times when "whatever we think is fine to do, is NOT". Cheers! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>One of the closest friends I have had on campus, this guy is awesome at everything he does. I admire your infinite patience (when teaching us guys most of the AAOC courses) and your brilliant sense of humor. It was fun hanging out with you. Wishing you best of luck for the future. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-shirbhate">Sahil Shirbhate</a></p>
<p>Neil! Yay! For almost the first 2 years on campus, this guy was nowhere to be seen; atleast I didn’t see him anywhere. I know the first time I actually met him was when I walked into his room cause a) he had a laptop and b) he had a datacard which me and TB needed to prepare for this epic debate. Yes this was way back in the first year. Then it was POE, yet again I found myself “using” him, but that probably was the start; the random pizza night in the middle of compre. Since then, it has been simply epic. It sounds all nerdy and shit, but that’s how this guy came out of his little shell. So in came MOS, then came Nescafe and before you knew it came Bogmalo! Though I must mention, the trouble definitely follows this guy and the worst part is it comes back to the campus with him. The stories we wrote “Spaghetti in Red Wine Sauce” and the infamous quote “Sir, I ate a lot of that spaghetti," funniest moments so far with this guy. And of course, this past year with what has been one gruelling semester of Economics. For a guy who says he hates it, he’s almost topped every single course there is. I can only wonder what he’ll do if I loves a course. I’ll see that next year I’m sure. He is “the nicest” guy you will ever find. His patience and level of tolerance are out of this world. And yes this patience has evolved into a temperament that his earned him the coveted “Google Summer of Code.” Yes this guy is sure going places and he will make it big in Silicon Valley. When you’re his friend, help is always round the corner, whatever it may be. We’ve got one killer year left man. To strong CB, double strong coffee, probhabhaly, dosa waala, mugger upper, goyte, 10:30pm and of course, spaghetti with red wine sauce. We’ll have lots more of these man.
