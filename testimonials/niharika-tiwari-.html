I definately see her as a future CEO of a company :) ..

<p>Was afraid of her in my first year, became friends in our second year (TRW - she was helping me to learn the formats before T2). Since then, i have always relied on her for most of the things. Be it information, syllabus, company to travel back home, anything, and she is always there for you. She is a divine beauty with the brains, well versed in literally everything, a true genius and hardworking girl. She has a very pure heart, with lots of care and love for everyone around her. She is a darling, one of a kind of girl on the campus always bindaas and carefree. May u keep on smiling. May you reach greater heights. Good Luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Niharika is one fun, bubbly girl! I have had great experiences with her throughout my Bitsian life, whether it was EG or EPS or MT1. Being the drama queen (:P) that she is, she always succeeded in either irritating me badly or making me laugh very hard. But she’s also very smart and dedicated to acads. So at the end of the day (or early next morning for EG), we always completed the work. I don’t think solving EG would be that memorable had I not had you in the same batch (Yes, the playlist fights were fun :P). Nor will I ever forget the MT2 physics labs with her and Neha. I must say they were the most entertaining lab partners I could have wished for :D It’s been great catching up with you with all the stories ;) I hope we can do that as frequently in the future. Will never forget your “Haan kya!” :D Wish you all the best! Do great! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>Niharika! Well, behind the nerdy girl who sits in the first bench in every class is a really sweet personality. We met during the EnI assoc meetings, and while we'd discuss what activities to organize, she'd be busy taking tips from seniors on how to study CDC's (guess they paid off). She's amazingly dedicated to her work. Moreover, she always has a smile on her face, and keeps going on. Always enthusiastic and cheerful. Hope you do great in your life ahead, and keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>

<p>Niharika - d 1st thing that comes to my mind is her trademark expression "Haa kya?!".. I have known her since my 1st days in BITS,right from d day of our admission..At that time we attended many "inductions" together and I remember she managed to make an impact on everyone in their 1st meeting itself...She is dedicated to her studies and her work ..... And she always ends her talk with her giggly-smile....She has excellent contacts which she started building right from her 1st year.... quite often her family comes over and we often get around with her Mom and sis who are very friendly,.... keep that spark in your eyes alive Niharika.... Have d best future ahead....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>

<p>I met her when we were inducted into Team BITSAA in first year. You will really like her trademark expression "Haan Kya?!". She is a talkative person and very entertaining to talk to. Stay the same. I wish her a bright future ahead.

<p>A very dedicated and hard working girl. Big fan of music, pizza and shopping! A day does not pass without her “HAAN KYA??!!” Always on time for classes and meals ( :P).  Loves watching TV series             ( FRIENDS! ) and dressing up (huge collection of earrings!! ).  Somebody who is multi- talented   (compering, singing, dancing, speaking, writing, drawing ( I remember those amazing sketches you had shown me!!)……) and yet focused . She is the delicate, beautiful , slim   ( :P) girl who is mostly locked up in her room ( usually online..we have chatted more than we have talked!) and runs away home given any chance ( and will then sit on fb whole day)!!... Will miss calling  you for dinner and having that fried papad  with you in the mess (our both’s favorite).. Wish you loads of luck for future!!..may you get whatever or WHOMEVER ( :P ) you ask for!! …love you loads..take care :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>
<p>Well well well, there is quite a lot to be said about niharika who i have come to know so well over the years i have spent in BITS. She has got an energy about herself which really rubs off pretty easily. She is extremely frank, bold and extrovert, very intelligent, fun loving but at the same time very mature.. A real kid at heart, Strong and sensitive, intelligent yet childish, outspoken yet mellow.. I would always cherish the moments which i have spent with her.. especially gautam bacher's classes where we go mad laughing like idiots.. :P ;P.. classes wouldn’t have been such a fun for me without her.. :P :P.. i actually find classes extremely monotonous when she is not around.. :P.. no i actually mean it :).. Niharika is extremely caring and helpful.. and she is someone who you can actually look for advices.. be it in studies or anything else.. She has been my alarm clock for a pretty long time ( i swear i would have missed a number of classes if she hadn’t been dere 2 look for me :P ). Her testimonial wouldn’t be complete if i don’t mention her 'han kya' here.. :P.. her han kya is hell like infectious which has not only taken me, our corridor people but people from each and every corner of this hostel in its grip!!!! :P.. She is extremely cute in her behavior and has a pleasant personality.. you would always find her humming around .. which sounds very melodious to ears :)!! I really appreciate her taste for music.. especially that she is one of those very few people out her in the campus who follow old hindi music!!!! :D.. I am really gonna miss her and cherish the memories of time that we spent together.. ! I wish her all the very best and wish that she achieves everything she desires.. :) god bless u!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/barkha-gupta">BARKHA GUPTA</a></p>
<p>Niharika, my cute little friend.. i dont where to start from.Open-minded, genuine, compassionate, and level-headed,she can always be counted on to listen and provide support when needed.  Her wonderful sense of humor, 
adventure, and life experiences have given her the ability to see any situation in a positive sense.No matter what she's doing, she is willing to listen and give advice, putting her own daily chores aside to help 
a friend in need. She will always join me for a hearty laugh and shed a tear any time of day. I have been gifted with the unconditional friendship of hers.Her optimistic attitude has always been an inspiration to me. I wish a very happy life ahead.

I know I will never get bored in your company !!  be it be dose pathetic opre classes we managed ! I remember the train journey we had, and how you slept  the earliest!!
