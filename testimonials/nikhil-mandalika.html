<p>Nikhil is full of style. He is a great football fan especially REAL MADRID. Cool guy, hes a bit brandy kind of a person. He's full of ideas whenever required. Good managerial and people skills. Have a great future ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>This is one guy who is always cool and never bothers to care about things he doesn't like. He is a great football goal keeper and is a die hard fan of Real Madrid. He is one of the most frank and genuine persons around someone with whom everyone would enjoy spending time with. His great communication skills will surely seek him soar to great heights. He is a person one can always rely on. He is very good at LAN gaming especially Fifa and Nfs. Even though he is an avid gamer, he manages to do well in acads. I wont forget the 3 years we spent as a neighbors doing fun and masti, especially the nfs time, late night futsal and the group studies. His friendship is one which can cherish for his entire lifetime. With his knowledge and hard-work he'll surely achieve great heights. Wish you all the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>Nikhilll ! An absolute gadget fanatic who has a great taste of music. I remember how you used to keep me updated about almost every song. I loved almost all you told me. This guy is really good at heart is understanding and will be always ready to help without an itch. He certainly has great managerial skills and a good representative :) :P. We have done many electives together and it was a great fun with loads of activities and assignments floating all around..!! The awesome trips we had and Omg..!! Bio labs. They were so much fun. Be it relevant or irrelevant, the kind of discussions we used to get into during the lab hours were out of this world ! I wish you all the very best for future and I know that you would scale the heights and excel in every field !! :D

<p>Nikhil… a cute friendly guy… the first think that you will notice about him is his smile.. he always has a ready tale to tell…has something good to say about everyone..I met him during marketing research, a weird place to make a friend, but guess if its meant to be it is! He has a great dressing sense and will go to any lengths to ensure he looks good ( :P ) , from my one experience with him I can say that he takes shops like a girl! Trying on every possible thing and buying it only when everybody consents. He is a friendly person and always lightens up the atmosphere….i remember  the trip to the nursery with you and ritwik, I even remember the little kid there… I remember all the great times we had together including you calling me a “nursery teacher” :P …jokes apart… you’re a great guy…May you have the  very best in life! Cheers!

<p>Came across this guy during MT1 practs :P He was in my almost every MT1 group! most prominent one was chemistry MT1 - because he would extensively caution me to pipette any chemical accurately. Thanks to him today I know taste of quite good number of chemicals :P
Nikhil is all about football!! Love is a small word. He worships it :D 
He can convince you anything - you just need to get into an argument :D 
Operates through his unavoidable charm.. and a very kind heart. Bio labs were fun having you around - playing most of the time with your mobile :P (I asked him once what is the measure of affection that guys have towards gadgets.... and he enlightened me - the number of bones he break of you after you break the gadget $-/) I still say 995 nokia model is best :P sasta and tikau :P This guy is one of the most passionate people in biology .... wish you great success :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>

<p>Manda is a very cool person with really good dressing sense, very friendly…During our 1st year elections, Nikhil got a fracture(stampede in the audi :D), it was thru that epic story how I came to know this guy. We were pretty close during our 1st year. This guy is really crazy abt games, the famous Demolisher!!!Name the game and he’s the 1st one to say “I’ve played that long ago”.
During our 1st year we used to do group study (well tat was always the plan..ended to be hours and hours of movie watching). It was in my 1-2 that I went out (with these people) the most!!! Almost every weekend we used to go to Bogmalo ryt?? And then do u remember the 1st rain on the campus during 1-2???It was during our compre, it started raining and we both threw our books aside and ran out into the rain….amazing!! Nikhil is also an expert in behaving well with girls, he used to give me many suggestions :D. We used to have long talks about these stuff :D. I can never forget the mynapi trip and all other trips we all went together. Have a bright future ahead!!stay in touch!!

<p>Huh, what can i say. I have lived beside him for 3 years now, and owing to our same branch, have interacted with him a hell-lot. He has been a great support for me throughout my Bio Courses and of course, THE labs. Still can't believe from where did a masters came up in the picture (:P)
Though I would say that he still can't be trusted with money (sorry, but Dude, you can't) His great nakhras of that of a girl, combined with his uh, errr, you-know-what, make him easily one of the most likable but irritating persons on the campus. 
A nice debator (though i find his arguments completley illogical :P ), great people skills and a cute baby face, a gamer and a story-teller with a nice sense of humor.
We have had so many great times together, the group studies, the trips, the labs, the timepass, the nautanki, the discussions and what not. It's just been great. I can go on and on, but won't, because it doesn't seem to be necessary. Be almost the way you are :)
I hope you go and do whatever you want to do in your life :) Wish you all the best.
And here's to the last year left!

<p>Nikhil! .. My neighbour and good friend for the last 3 years,I really enjoyed each bit of your company.Be it at the mess or over at Puneet's fifa den,you're a great guy to be with.This is one really down-to-earth guy,an honest and a very sincere friend.We shared some great times on and off DC,and those times will always make for good stories for later.I really admire his dedication to Bio subjects,even when most were slacking off and taking it lite.Hes not some random wannabe football guy,but this guy is one of the most enthusiastic fans I have seen,who not only follow the game off the field,but also play it well on the field.I'm still in deep admiration for your great gaming skills...Great Stuff man! .... I don't really see what others label in you as feminine,and I like you the way you are.You're a really great person,and dont you change!...I wish you the very best for the great future that you have worked hard to create for yourself... :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
<p>Nikhil..! I now remember your broken ankle on one of the first few days in College.. - after you reminded me in the testimonial you wrote for me..!! :P
Coming to your Testimonial - Nikhil is one of the nicest, a die-hard Real Madrid fan, & one of the charming guys without whom Football in AH4 & Football in my life wouldnt have been the same..The endless discussions on Real Madrid, UCL, La Liga, Barca, Man Utd, Torres (:D) - with him have been insatiably joyous. FIFA is a picece of cake for him - be it any level, he surpasses your expectations. The one person along with I totally get in sync with, while playing the game. Man, I've had some of the most brilliant matches - 1 I remember is where we both played against Puneet & Harshit; and the scores went on like 0-1, 0-2, 1-2, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4, 4-4, 4-5, 5-5; and then we won the game 6-5 in the last minute - I remember this game as this was when I realized your passion for football, your dexterity in FIFA & never say die attitude. I had a lot to learn in FIFA from you man - we are the FIFA bros :P. I remember when you saved me on more than one occasion in our only course together - Marketing Research - Some of the meetings we had in our group were epic. We literally made fun of everyone and seriously, I had the blast in those meetings - the few that I attended :P.  
Nikhil is a Bio pro - loves Bio just as much he loves Football & Mourinho :P
I had the awesomest of times with you man - be it MR meetings, trips in Goa (once I remember his iPod getting broken by "someone"  :P), at/in/after Farewell; and actually not a day passes by when I dont miss the epic & wonderful chats we have about football.
Dude, you are the nicest, most stylish person I know; and man I hope one day you actually see Madrid winning the UCL; even if it means they beat United to the trophy. (There are some things money cant buy; for everything else, there's Mourinho :D). I wish you all the best in your life; and as a brother of the Sport, if ever I become the Brian Clough of the game, I want you there at the game with me as Peter Taylor! We will make History..!! Good Luck.!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
