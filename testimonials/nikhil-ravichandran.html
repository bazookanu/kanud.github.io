<h1 class="page-title">Nikhil Ravichandran</h1><p>There are two ways to write a testimonial for Nikhil Ravichandran, 

1) Write an encyclopedia about how free spirited he is, how he loves the world and all its parts, how he loves "living", how he enjoys being "himself", how he learns things so quickly, how he always wants to know "why" rather than "how" and his earnest and light heartened sense of humor.

2)What can i say about Nikhil Ravichandran!! That he was truly amazing. That he loved the guitar. And every cuisine ever dared to be made by humanity. And a never ending slumber. And me!!! That i loved him back, that this testimonial sounds gay, yet so true!! 

I cannot imagine my universe without you Niksy!! Thanks for being my Buffalo, Soul mate, Sidey and {things will get explicit if i go any further darling} ;-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>

<p>Nikhik aka motu.. He is one of the coolest guys in the campus. A very chilled out person, he takes things as they come. Whenever I went to his room, he was busy playing guitar. He is gr8 singer too. He will surely become rock star one day. He is one of those guys in the campus who comes in my league & never teases me of becoming fat :D. I am glad to have known you. I wish you all the best for your future.. Be in touch mote...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>He is one if my closest and best friends.He is the person with whom I can share almost anything that's on my mind.As he already mentioned,it was destiny that we met(from bits hyd mech to bpgc eni).The size of his heart is directly proportional to his wieght :P .He finds happiness in all the simple things in life.He is very serious when it comes to studies.(PhD level depth mein chala jata hai when it comes to understanding concepts! :P).He is awesome when it comes to singing and playing guitar.Also he's one of the very few people I know who can rap!(and that too at 2x speed with the correct lyrics!!). Loves watching "li8 comedy"movies =) .He is a child at heart and cares a lot about his friends.He never lets his friends feel low and gloomy.He's the one with whom I have spent countless hours of FIFA sessions :D .. and yeah he can start his very own SOTD list.His taste in music is \m/ and his song suggestions are obviously awesome.I seriously can't imagine how I am going to survive the next semester without him :( .We'll always be in touch.All the best for ur future =)

PS: His fav gun in cs is AK47<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-gupta">Arpit Gupta</a></p>
<p>If Nikhil were a Transformer, he would be called Optimist Prime. We met first at Hyderabad and ever since, I have awes at his ability to view just any situation with the carefree assurance that it will be taken care of, and that he need not worry himself over it. He does procrastinate; but then: he spends the time thus saved in living the life he desires - a quality that can so greatly be appreciated! Now, the life he desires involves a lot of junk food, loud music, computer games and a very very skewed body clock. And this has, over the course of our intimacy, evoked a lot of chiding reactions from me; but looking backâ€¦ But looking back, I wouldn't change a thing about him. I would keep him the way he his - the baby of our corridor, and one of the most imperturbable fellows you will ever have the fortune of knowing. Nikhil, I enjoyed being with you these three years. May you find a career to your liking!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tuhin-sah">Tuhin Sah</a></p>
