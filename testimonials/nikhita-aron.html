<p>One of the very famous faces on campus. She enjoys every moment of life and extracts the extreme fun out of each. With her ever-smiling face, she can win anyone's heart. She is also very intelligent & can learn almost anything in few seconds. She is very hard-working as well. Also a well cultured girl. She is very helpful although a bit rude at some times. Enjoyed awesome 2months of PS with her. Will always cherish those moments.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>Nikhita,nikooooo, nikkkiiiiiiiii!! hehe. I have known you since our school days and let me tell you it has been one hell of an amazing journey! You are the most genuine person I know. An amazingly sincere and a huge sweetheart, it is always nice to know that you are here. You have always listened to my rona dhona patiently and supported me whenever I have needed it. Nikhita, you are one of the most simple and cute person I have ever known. You have a really cute laugh, remember how Trisha used to copy it :P haha! Balkani, oh my god! you remind me of the best days we had. I wish we could have been in the same corridor and would have interacted more. Damn! it is always a pleasure to talk to you. Even when all of us a teasing you, you keep smiling that amazing smile and laughing with us. You are truly a girl next door! :) The longest friend I have had here and the most amazingly sincere, huge hearted and honest person I have ever known. You have that extraordinary knack for excelling in whatever you put your mind into. You are one of the most intelligent and practical people I have known. You are and always have been amazingly grounded and have always kept your cool whatever the situation has been. I know that you will always succeed in whatever you do. Wishing you all the happiness in your life and hoping you achieve whatever you want. Love you loads. And yeah we will keep in touch. You, me and Aditi have huge plans for the future :P Keep smiling that dazzling smile :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>

<p>Nikkkkiiiiiii...she is truly a unique person and i have never met anyone like her( except her judwa "ANAM":P) in my life ;) well, that is obviously a compliment, in case you r wondering :P she has the weirdest acts like "ishita please mujhe exact 8:37 pe utha dena" ya "main so nai rahi thi, main soch rahi thi" or her secret to remain slim n trim even after eating more than everyone else( divya excluded, obviously :P) or her "just so cool" dance steps which even though neha teases her for, but i just love them, seriously!! :D she is a very hard working person and is focused to what she wants and strives hard to achieve it which is one of the things that i admire the most in her :) She is always so much fun to be with and she always  reminds me of my frnd Anam and Anam reminds me of her :) All the awesome times with you, the endless gossip sessions, the DJ nites in my room, neha's dancing classes esp for you n sooooo many more moments spent with you will be missed a lottttt :( And i wish from the bottom of my heart that you achieve all the heights and all your wishes come true. Love you a lottt nikkkiiiiii. Always be the same and no matter where i am, you can always call me to wake you up at weird times :P i am always there for you :) All the veryy best and be happy alwayss :):**<3<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Nikhita, is one of the sweetest people I have come across here. Ever cheerful, she brightens up the atmosphere instantly. She is smart and yet very down-to-earth. The funniest part I remember is how she would doze off instantly anywhere and when you wake her up she'll say "Main soi nahi thi" :P You will always find her smiling or laughing :)  With her brains, her dedication to studies and her happy-go-lucky attitude I am sure she'll go a long way in life.. Wishing you all the best NIkhita :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreya-kedia">Shreya Kedia</a></p>

<p>Nikita aron... ohh sorry..!! NKHITA aron..!! if it was up to me I would definitely award her the most confused soul of our batch. Whenever you meet her there is 9/10 probability that she is lost in her own thoughts. Well coming to the good part, behaviour wise I see no way I could harass her more.. so let me just spill it out. nikhita you are the cutest girl i have ever met, your simple and down to earth nature sometimes amaze me. The hard work and sincerity you put in your work is commendable and sometimes you do inspire me (please note “sometimes”).if today you are counted out of the nerd circle, just know that it’s all because of me. It was I who took you on your first bike trip, it was I you taught you how to life your life “AB style” and it was I who helped you look like a girl, my continuous harassment and taunting finally paid off and today I can proudly say that your beauty has increased exponentially ever since. And i will definitely count you in my top 10 list(hope you remember that)...wait make it top 8.From our 1st sem to this very day it’s been a wonderful journey and still I believe there is more to come. Please start gyming you have gained a lot of pounds and one more thing PLEASE, PLEASE get out of my head , even today I am haunted by your shrill and piercing voice calling out  my name “apooooorv” “apoooooooooooooorv”. Stay in touch- AB<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorv-bhardwaj">Apoorv Bhardwaj</a></p>
<p>nikkuuu :P Ab to i cant stop smiling whenever any one says nikku.She is always fun to be with!!Very cute and very entertaining :) Everytime raat ko before bio papers i would go and knock her room and ask her how long will she be awake :P Arranging notes from sumwhere nd den tryin to make sum sense out of it :P Interpreting ur handwriting ( i admit mine too ) was d toughest job to do :P I seriously wonder how are teachers able to do it.. :P All of my bio trips were possible only bcoz u were dere!! The level of sincerity she has sometimes amazes me!!!There are so many thing about you and its so hard not to like you nikhita!! :P 
Had a great time with you!! I m really glad that we have 1 more year together and lets make the best out of it :)

<p>NIKHITA....A very enthusiastic person  and very hard working.When given a task she'll put all her efforts into it.It was fun working with you in PS...making STMAID (:P).The project never really worked out...but working with you made the work seem much more fun than it was.Doing fb,chatting when sitting right next to each other ,running away to carol bagh(and then coming running back because of pramod "sir"),..they were one of the most memorable times I've had.All the best for your future...I m sure you'll do great.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/meghna-mehta">Meghna Mehta</a></p>
<p>Waise havent known her a a lot ,however still a great thanks for literally making get pass NC in Workshop labs.I remember every time I touched the workpiece it went really out of shapes,and the frustrated look you gave:-"OMG ! Amit I asked you not to touch it." She is very hardworking and meritious,all the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
