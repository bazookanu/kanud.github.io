<h1 class="page-title">Nikita Gulati</h1><p>Nikita is one the most friendliest and smartest girls on campus. We were in the same coaching for two years and since then, she has been this fun loving, bubbly and bright person. She is really awesome at dancing and has been a dedicated member of the dance club of the college. Apart from this, she is very sincere in all the things that she likes and has a passion for. She is a great friend to hang out with. Cheers and all the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>Nikita is intelligent, a brilliant dancer, an amazing friend and simply fun to hang out with. So it comes across as no surprise that she is liked by so many. She was one of the four people I knew in college while joining and right from the first ragging to the last party, we've had an awesome time together! There have been some totally kick-ass moments. Thank you, Nikita, for each one of them!
Best of luck for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>

<p>Nikita Gulati! The perfect example of beauty with brains.. :) Her dance can set fire on stage and in hearts! I didn't become friends with her till my 1-2 (life of a bitsian) and i regret not knowing her before..  fikku, you have been my support whenever i needed you and i promise to be there for you.. Always.. :) I don't think i could have ever enjoyed bits if you were not there.. One thing i want to say is that you are capable of looot more than you give yourself credit for and the sooner you realise that, the higher you will reach.. The study sessions, night outs and gossiping will go on, as i am sure we will keep meeting.. I cant loose you now that i have you in my life.. Keep smiling.. I love you.. :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/avni-goyal">Avni Goyal</a></p>
<p>Nikita Gulati, met her barely some 8 months ago and in such a short time the friendship has come such a long way through..its almost like I've known her for years now..... its difficult to be not charmed by her sweet demeanour .. a perfect example of beauty with brains ... can set alight a stage with her dance performances.. i saw very few of them and I regret not attending the earlier dance nights! An extremely fun person to hangout with.. one of those people who have made my past two semesters in this campus a very pleasant time full of cherished memories..  She's always there to discuss any topic on this planet .. that's what made up those awesome late night chat sessions :P She's one determined, sincere and at times even stubborn person who achieves anything she sets her heart on .. She's one of the most trustworthy and loyal friends I have.. Nikita,I'm sure you will have extremely successful life ahead..  And you better not forget to keep in touch after BITS life is done... Best of luck for future.. Keep smiling :)

<p>The first month campus, and that is when i became great friends with Nikita!!...Those initial days of campus and we had already become such good friends...It was accompanied with a lot of Ragging initially(i remember at a point we just refrained ourselves from leaving the hostel!!) :P, endless rounds of Carrom in the common room, first outing in Goa, late night movies, birthday celebrations and the list goes on!!..The first few months of being here were made so easy by here mere presence. She is damn sharp and intelligent ( her love for maths is beyond everything), an electrifying dancer(i know a lot has been said about it already!!..:D) and she has very friendly vibe around her always!!...More recently our labs together and freaking assignments got us talking a lot again!!!...It was great knowing you!!...Stay this charming forever and you shall achieve great heights in life!!...Keep in touch...Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>OMG!!...How can i even forget her for a moment. The first day in workshop when she was in my group and i learnt that her id no. was just next to mine (mine was 232, hers was 233), i told her " I think we are gonna be stuck for all the labs till we pass out". Looking back at the past 3 years, i was surely right. There were numerous times when i had to help her, there were even times when she returned the favor :P . Her company has always been amusing and fun. She is a very sweet girl. With a truly wonderful and honest attitude, i hope all ur wishes are fulfilled. Wish u good luck for ur future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>fikuuuu:)
When i first started speaking to you,i never expected to find a completely vulnerable,extremely emotional girl inside tht hot xterior.Instead of an attitude,i found a completely nonjudgemental,sweet and caring person inside.once a person comes to know u,they cant help but love u(xplains 2-2 rather well,don't u think?:P).when we started talking more n more,i realised we had a lot in common..the hymns,our drunkenness(yes i still rmbr u were a witness to me falling all over in 1st sem,bogmalo),the songs and movies we liked,most important..the 'icseness' in us!:D ur the person i could relate to the most in bits,who didnt leave me feeling like i came from an alien world. 
ur a superrrr amazing dancer!!!u can literally adapt to any style!and of course,ur our resident fashion diva:)and the way you blend in any kind of environment and can talk to all kinds of ppl is simply WOW!!You're a beautiful person inside out,with a remarkable tendency to hurt urself..physically n emotionally:/ 
The night outs in hostel,night out plans(only!) outside campus,our talks,dance club memories will always stay with me:) More recently,gari room memories,the gossip sessions,lets not talk abt coatpiece..(don't worry we'll kick their asses next time:P).i love the way we connect inspite on not meeting regularly.n i think u shud kno i plan to stalk u in ur last sem:D
Here's hoping u get ur fairytale ending:)
love u loads!!:*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-saboo">Priyanka Saboo</a></p>

<p>Nikitaaa!! My PS mate!! :D Had a greatttt time with you in that horrible and sucky place whose name majority of ppl might not have even heard of :P but you n sonia made that place tolerable :) I still remember all the mastiii that we used to do there-watching movies, our weekly(sometimes twice a week) shopping (omg! soo much we used to eat :P), the 1st and the last time we had in Tulsi(worst chinese ever-cant even call it chinese :P), our chicken treats outside with the guys and also that weird gola we used to have after that, the water fight and the photo session following that :P, the 1st time we had chicken in our acco and the cat attack(u were the brave one who called help, btw :P:D), our 1st bunk and us getting caught(n u ppl named that "ishi's LOL day" bcoz of that stupid msg mistake :P), our diu visit which was again so much fun with all of us together and soooo muchhh moree is there , i cant even recollect. But in short i wud just like to say, that each n every day in Jafarabad turned out to be an adventure with you there! You are a great person, very helpful and a really sweet person to talk to. It was great getting to know a person like you. N despite Jafarabad being one of the worst places ever, it was made memorable because of your company :) finally i wud just like to wish you all the very best in life. May you get whatever you desire for and keep rocking always. Cheers!! :D:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Nikita! you are a really really sweet person! n its unfortunate that i didnt get to interact with you much before our 3-2, but im glad that i did now :) you are really sweet, smart and of course, really pretty, and a very strong and graceful dancer. I will always remember hanging around in gari's room, probably playing UNO or some other card game, or eating biryani that we ordered from the IC or just randomly chatting away about the most random things like playing minesweeper or about the plant that grows right outside you window :) and yes, you too make me laugh a lot! And yeah, i also wont forget the making of your video for your college applications! our fake classroom scene n fake table tennis game n fake GD.. :D stay this way, i really hope we will meet in the years to come, probably at gari's wedding ;) Stay in touch n take care!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tara-ramanan">Tara Ramanan</a></p>
