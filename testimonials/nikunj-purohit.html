<h1 class="page-title">Nikunj Purohit</h1><p>A very docile person when it comes to enduring taunts, but tell him an exam is round the corner and he'll show you what he is capable of!. Has tremendous amounts of determination and the ability to slog it out when the going gets tough, much like the captain(remember he is from 'Karnataka') of his favourite IPL team 'Rajasthan'.He is very hard working, be it at mastering microprocessors or his tennis serves. He dishes out the most unimaginable PJ's. But Importantly he is a very good person and someone whom you can always rely on when you need help.Wish you all the very best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>
<p>Nikuuuuuuunzzzzzzz (our very own sarkar).......d name is enough!!!!! :D
i met him no..... actually saw a name "nikunj" printed on a college-bag on my 1st or 2nd day @ collg (it ws d curiosity of finding out d personality owing tht bag which landed me a "frnd-forever"), eventually found out tht dis guy not only lives 6 rooms nxt to me in hostel but also is a neighbour even at home (lives 2km away)......
a great guy, handsome and smart (i mean it), a kind and helping person, a guy with d most strangled principles ( :P), phodu @ acads, @tennis and a lot of othr things.....a guy vid d most strange movie choices (slept watching "Dark Night" nd "LOTR".....nd njoyed "khelein hum jee jaan se" like hell :P :D )....nd GOD has blessed him vid d most _/\_ expressions....u nevr kno wat can come to u during chit-chats....!! :) 
my train buddy (still misses d red blanket we once got in Rajdhani during our journey to home :P)......my PS buddy (made vadodara a nice place to survive...thnx :D)
i'l miss d time spent vid him in his room fighting exams(especially AAOC ones)......discussions around ur n pandey's room abt ur "/\" crushes......d trips......ur "big" mistakes ( missing Laser show fr wrkshop reports nd many more.. ;) ).......our promises to meet while at home n d negotiations vid our parents to avoid d meetings......!! :)
PS : ppl come n go....say watevr dey want (evn me)......but plzz be d same tht u r....u r perfect!
Wish u gud luck fr ur future........and we'l meet @home so we'l surely be in touch!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subhanshu-pareek">Subhanshu Pareek</a></p>
<p>kooooooooonzzzzzzzzzz...Govinda...govinda...!
His feat in Zephyr 2010 is unmatched, unparalled, uncomparable!
The best part about him is that he never frowns at the various jokes/taunts he gets (ek ouch bhi nahi karta :P) (coz uss ouch pe bhi log uski le lenge :P :P ) He used to get all sweaty during exams, but i guess he's over that thing. From what we all were in our first year, I say he's the one who has changed the most among us!
Always in his room with infi tabs opened in his chrome doing some research/ ghoting his curriculum. 
Hardworking and also famous for his PJs (Those wont even qualify to be a PJ, I guess).
He's handsome :) (As I always say, you need to watch those ocean series movies)
Do keep in touch!

<p>Actually I was kinda scared of him in 1-1..I always thought he was kind of a a serious guy and would never tell 'my kind of jokes' near him...then got to know him a little better and knew this guy is as twisted and as fun loving as any of us...though he gets pretty serious during exams...and feels guilty if he eats snacks during exams... would miss coming to ur room for absolutely nothing and asking about the relationship status of random girls on ur facebook chat list ... definitely one the most good looking guys in the campus....can get any gal he wants just doesn't try :P ....best for luck for ur EEE cdc's ... though u don't need them am sure... keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sriram-iyer">Sriram Iyer</a></p>
<p>Nikunj. Padhne ke siwa bhi kuch kiya kar. Mar jaega padh padh ke chu. Jaa jeele apni zindagi. CH1 mein hain accha hua. BDome aur bhi paas ab. Library bhi. Apart from all these little things I guess Koonj is a great guy. Poor in everything he does. CS. Cricket. Fifa. What not. Except studies. A nice guy with a golden heart. I know you will do well in life cause you know how to get what you want in life. A real gift. Just be happy and tension ko lite lena. 4th year mein baccho ka rape karna( in  EEE cdc's I mean and not the Sriram kinda way). Best of luck for your future.
