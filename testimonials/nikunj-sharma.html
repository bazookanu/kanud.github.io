<h1 class="page-title">Nikunj Sharma</h1><p>One of the few true pop-culture fanatics on campus. Nicks' love of good cinema and television is unparalleled. He's one of those big friendly giants you come across. He's calm, composed and loads of fun. Live long and prosper! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Nikunj-the benevolent giant, is one guy who makes me hope I was gay,cause I would readily spend all my life with him.Along with Mota (Abhishek Arun) he is a person with a tireless stamina for fun,chatting and adventure.My friendship with him started in the very first sem when I realised he was one of the very few guys who laughed at my jokes,and seemed to understand what I was saying.:P.The most chilled out guy in campus,he is also a movie and tv-series buff who has watched almost every worth-watching movie on DC(u name it.he has watched it) He is also a brilliant recommend-er of stuff, had it not been for Niks, the only Dexter I would have known would have been DeeDee's brother .Possessing a razor-sharp mind and incredible persistence,he might finish two movies,a book,and a tv-series all in one day.IA very handy striker and rock-solid goalkeeper(in futsal),he is also perhaps the best cricketer in our group(Sorry Sapra).His sastas are deadly,and with that quick-wit he can really fuck your case(Nachi, Pranky, Sapra and Manas will testify to this) .Loves chocolate,bhindi,Shah Rukh and Chelsea(nice combo).Very extrovert,sociable and friendly he is popular among both guys and girls.If u have studied in Bits,and not known Niks,u have surely missed something amazing.Yo Niksy!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/asim-ali">ASIM ALI</a></p>

<p>Nikxxy... My first love...  let me tell you there no such thing in this world that can help me to express myself about how I feel about you... Just there are soo many things we have shared right from our first day of college to this day. I can’t forget the fun we have had... laughing till our faces turn blue , talking of the things only we find funny and most of the neighbors thinking that we are insane- if they only knew! . It’s been a great journey and a most cherished one. I have never met a guy so simple and down to earth; you certainly have a thing or two that I can learn from you. : P (was a joke= PUN). Still remember that bike ride where you made me sit on 1/4th of the seat just because you were scared, those long discussions of Chelsea lineup and off course your family stories..!!   Our inside jokes and "remember when’s"- those are the reasons that we're best friends. Over the years my affection for you has increased exponentially and for those who don’t know besides AB I am also known as his gay counterpart and YES..!! I’m proud of it. Just be the same always no matter what people tell you.. You’re the best..!!
Love  
-AB

<p>Niks!! Niks has been my partner-in-crime for sooo many different case-taking sessions, that i've lost count! :D I met this passionate Chelsea fan pretty late into my college life but i couldn't be more glad to have actually met him! One of the nicest, kindest, most chilled out and fun loving guys I've ever met! I don't think I've ever seen Niks without a smile on his face! His presence just emanates joy and happiness! Niks is a TV show maniac and i still remember our Studio 60 discussions! :D I'm really going to miss him and his amazing attitude towards life! From futsal to Bogmalo to Utorda or the yepic birthday treat,  the pleasure has been all mine! Take care Niks and  yes, Party ab abhi baki hai! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>The most carefree person I know. A cinephile, there would be hardly any movie or TV show that exists and he hasn't seen it. You name it and in an instant you get a review which is either "tatti hai. mat dekh" or "Bhai faadu. Faadu matlab faadu." A die-hard Chelsea fan(I hope not a fair-weather one, since they aren't gonna play in the Champions League next season :P). Awesome futsal-keeper, one of the best on campus. Looks like this giant who can beat the shit out of you, and he can, but is very very immature most of the times. Memorising power is god-like. The amount of focus and hardwork he can put in during exams is a whole another side to him. The I-don't-give-a-fuck attitude that he usually has disappears during that span of days. Impossible to have an argument with, because as I said he is a kid. They quarrel.  Very very unlike a typical Marwari. One of my closest friends on campus. Here's to a long long friendship. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Oh and yes,  I forgot to mention that he has a sweet tooth. Likes to have the most exotic of chocolates and despises sharing them. There are times when he has quarter k.g.  kaju katli for lunch. Love the fact that he goes home so many times in a sem, because of all the mithai that he brings back with him :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>

<p>Nikster!! A wonderful and entertaining person, his sense of humor is well known(for different reasons..). He has this very chilled out air about him, and can really lift people at anytime (well..). Hes a very simple and straightforward guy, everything comes naturally to him, no complications and no hassles. We've had great times together may it be the epl matches, bogmalo nights, the mumbai bus journey and especially the manipal trip!. Niks its been a real treat knowing you, but better times await!

<p>Niks ( I would have addressed him by the nickname I use but then, this is a public forum) is a humble, hairy figure who actually practices the 'love-all' principle. TV show addict, he's seen innumerable shows, ranging from the worst to the very best. When God was distributing a sense of humour, either Nikunj's bowl was leaky or the quantity was too less for Nikunj's huge physique. Trust this guy to be the saving grace when you have cracked a really bad joke. Also my Bombay hang-out buddy, we've eaten and drank at the poshest and shadiest places across town. We will surely keep doing that for a long time. PS Remember those Bollywood sequences that had the actor and actress running around the forest chasing each other? Those were shot on Nikunj's chest.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
