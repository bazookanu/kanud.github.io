<p>THE LIVE WIRE !!!  Always full of life and energy and pulling crazy pranks on people. A genius who can grasp things very quickly.  The physics PRO and the BAAP of electronics. Amazing cricketer .Has a penchant for irrational numbers...(hope u understand what i mean.... :P)Anybody who has used DC would know him (Main chat bakwaas.....). Really helpful guy and shows his innermost affections by strangling you till death.  Always ready to kick on everybody's birthday. Amazing initiativity. Has mood swings of the extreme. Hot headed but very softhearted (very soft indeed...). Have really amazing memories with ...(especially the ones with staring in the sky...\m/ \m/ )....A very dear friend  of mine ... May your whole life be as enjoyable as your stay in BITS... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>Nilesh, the energetic, talented, funny, stylish, physics GEEK is so much capable and qualified that he may one day prove that even he fails to exist in this world. The mirror cracks when he stands in front of it, saying "Even I cannot reflect so much passion as he does!!" The clown faced elf is a great elf to be around. Always playing poker on Facebook, this guy will give you jitters, when he shouts unexpectedly in a beastly manner. Moreover, he is die-hard fan of tennis and Nadal, to the extent that if given chance he may even replace Shakira in the song 'gypsy' !! Apart from all this, he is a real fun guy to hangout with. A real caring, sweet, extraordinary, sometimes a nuisance, newton's derivative, may someday exceed Chandrasekhar's limit and become a white dwarf, but he will definitely become one of the great personalities of this world, before that transformation. I learned a lot from his lifestyle, and his devil may care attitude, towards life. May God bless the physics GOD, and  I hope that you come up with some new formulas of physics that your children can learn.

<p>BHALA the dude in M Prakash who 7 days of the week for 2 years sat on the first bench in class.Known him since June 1 2007(And yet another of my physics + eee buddy).A person with crystal clear concepts who can on his day phodofy anything and everything.A gem of a person who is humble,modest,sincere,dedicated and very down to earth,always willing to help and stand by his friends.There is never a dull moment whenever he is around.His witty one liners and gtalk sm's are a comic relief.A proud Nadal fan I envy the passion and enthusiasm he possesses in abundance.Hope we remain friends forever.I am confident he will achieve great academic excellence with his intelligence.BOL!!!!

A great you can always look upto..I wish good luck for your future!:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>
<p>The dude from Akola! thats how i would describe hm :D

I dont think i have to say much about his special qualities or temperament or abilities given he has chosen  to pursue Msc Physics +EEE in our campus, i think that speaks a ton for itself than any of us can . I hope he gets out of these in one piece though :P

Anyways been a great sports enthusiast , one of those few common room guys who u would always like to be with while watching anything live in the common room of our hostel!   Have a great future ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>
<p>Nilesh Bhala a.k.a !@st_H0rCruX/nadal/li8_lo a.k.a nilu/bhala/bhalesh/ganesh/bhalla. This guy has more nicks both in real life as well as on dc than anyone else I know. This guy is passionate and full of life. Be it cricket, tennis, physics, poker, fb/dc/real-life chudaap or anything else; he pours his heart out in it. Strong ethics define him. He is highly energetic, often marked by his weird shoutings and screams(much akin to bellu's laughs in terms of decibels :P). Helpful, caring and ever-present for his friends. He is one person whom you can literally trust your life with, unless he is angry. He is fairly short tempered, hence the name hot-head. It doesn't take much to anger him but he doesn't really keep grudges for too long. Bring him a couple of Aloo-parathas from kashi and all will be fine :D. Once averse to mcs and bcs, but now he cant complete his sentences without cussing. He is the GOD of dc-chudaap, awfully pathetic pjs and physics. Physics is his first and (hopefully not) last love ( for more than one reasons ;) ). Even 2 sems of grueling physics CDCs have done little to dampen his spirits and interest in physics. 

<p><p>
Here's a toast to years of friendship, to the train journeys, to the underarm cricket; and to all the insane chudaapas, sastas, and innumerable fits of laughters shared with you. Best wishes for the future. Tu toh relatively paas mein hi rehta hai, milte rehna :).

<p>Whore-crux. Now that's what I'll call you. Nilesh is one awesome guy. I first met him in the workshop, where he got all his workpieces made for himself during the demo. Wicked. But as I came to know him better, he is just one fun guy you can never get bored with. We both had great time together. Always cracking jokes on other people and making this hell lot of an experience. He is big fan of Nadal. Even his GTalk image shows that. He likes living life to the fullest. He has been present in every damn outing we had arranged. I dont have words for the fun we had in third year. Thanks for being a part of it. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>If i were told to live my rest of life in BITS w/o this guy,..then i will literally die, well cliches aside, but such has been the importance of this guy in my life..............he is one insane person  who lives life fully...............this guy has got well tons of nicks, each one calls him whatever they feel like :P................my day usually begins with me coming out of the room and first checking if nilu is der in his room..............im sure even gtalk and ‘pm’ on dc would be fed up of us, so much of time we have spent talking virtually:P, let alone actually..............i know that this guy will always be der for me even at the slightest problem............our bond is such that i know i can go upto his room  any time of the day i want and tell him anything i want................if nothing else, ill ping him for the stupidest possible things  from which begins our endless chats..............he is the reason i have actually cleared 1 year in physics  sanefully............for he  was the one who always woke me up and forced me to come for morning  classes.............sometimes evening classes as well :x.........or made me do the assg by explaining it to me every little bit of me.............i owe more than half of the things i know to him because he always comes up to me at the end of the day and makes sure that i have understood everything ..........and if not then he will sit with me and patiently explain every bit of it..............i still remember how he kept on trying to teach me Mup till the last moment w/o giving up or getting frustrated at my ignorance every time....................studies apart, he is an absolutely delightful and funny person.............is capable of doing all sorts of crazy things.............he is an absolute emotional and romantic person at heart:P..............whenever (or rather daily when ) we come out of the hostel, he’ll tell me to look up and just goes on wondering how beautiful the sky and  moon is tonight..............but i fail to comprehend any such thing :P....................well actually he has a lot of interest in space and astrophysics...............has a really short temper, i remember in our first year......there were many guys in the hostel who knew him just as a guy with a temper as he had thrown away a chair in the common room once..............you really woudn’t want to piss this guy of because even the hostel assistant is not saved from his wrath then :D............,has those weird status updates always and then there are always his special comments on facebook and all :P....................a huge fan of Nadal and keeps a thorough track of all his matches and activities :D...............watches lots of tv series and movies...........the best thing about him is that he is driven by strong ethical and moral values and not even once in 3 years have i seen him compromise on these...............if i start even counting the no awesome times that i have had with him, im sure i’ll fall short of space............be it watching tennis and cricket matches in the common room all day long or playing cards in nitins room the entire night..........or playing cricket in the hostel at any time of the day.............or just playing poker on fb in the vacations ............or just sitting around or roaming anywhere chatting all day long.............he was there to support me for every slam or bpl or any damn match that i played, be it in the  morning or even as late 1 pm ................ i can actually go on and on but i think ill stop here.............words cannot really express how much you mean to me.............BITS has probably given me one of the best things in life in the form of your friendship.........thanx for everything:) ............CHEERS!!!!!!!
