<p>HEy! I haven't known this guy a lot but in the short time I have known him he has proved to be one of the most genuine people. He is really sweet a helpful person. A really soft spoke and calm guy it has been a pleasure to talk to him. One of the humble and intelligent people I know who listened to me patiently while i talked all random shit. Really fond of taking photographs, Nishant I hope you stay the same hardworking, sincere person that you are. It has truly been a pleasure knowing you. All the very best for your future! Hopefully you will remember me when you are earning like a million bucks! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>
<p>A wonderful person, very patient, calm, soft-hearted and very hard working. The best thing about him is that if he really wants to do something, he goes for it. 
Even if he was miles ahead, he has always waited for me till the last moment. I still remember the first day in college when my parents went back home and I was very upset, he was the one who came up to wipe off my tears. . I know that I can always count on him.
 He is a great sketcher and an awsme photographr....apart from all that he always makes us laugh at his witty jokes. A very humble person who never thought anything ill of others.........
I can assure that whatever definition of a true friend anyone has ever read or text'd, completely fits him. 
Truly telling now it has become a habit that whenever I pray anything for myself, I do the same for him.......Hope along with my prayers, u fulfil all ur wishes....and don't wrry I will always come to Celebrate them with you.........Cheers to our life!!!!!!  :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>
<p>Nishant… one of my oldest pals in campus… a sensible ,sensitive, handsome  guy who always has an appropriate response to whatever you have to say….he has his thoughts very clear on every topic yet the best thing about him is that he is willing to listen to what everyone has to say, willing to change with the world and that is one thing that I am sure will take him a long way… He is fully devoted to what he does, he strives for perfection and does so not to prove something to someone but for his own inner satisfaction, which in today’s world is hard to find. He is extremely talented, and can write, sing and sketch beautifully…He has his own way of making you feel comfortable and once you’re with him you can forget All your troubles and just be yourself…Our friendship has had its up and lows but it has stood the tests of time…We have spent some beautiful moments together, and you my friend, are someone I will never forget… may you achieve all your dreams.. lots of love.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>I have now known him for almost 2 years and he has evolved a lot to become a strong person. Of course he is a calm and a quiet person and all but his thoughts run deep. He has the maturity to react to a situation aptly. He knows when to say things and when to keep quiet. He is one of those rare guys who doesn't have the ego to hide his emotional side if you know him. He is a decent guy with the right attitude towards girls (No girl can EVER feel scandalized by him:P). He is a good listener and can keep secrets. It's been nice to have deep and interesting conversations with him on various topics, pinging him at any random times commenting on gtalk status or complaining about any unpleasant thing bothering at that instant. He is a good example of the combination, hard work + intelligence. He knows to apply his knowledge in practice. (May this quality of yours take you far ahead in life). He has more that this to add to his credits. He is a good writer/poet. His writings reflect the depth of his thoughts. (I have told him many times to create a blog). Besides he can make nice sketches too. I wish you loads of luck in life. May you achieve all your goals and get the right girl in life ;).

<p>First impression is the last, and that last, is the best in his case. A very calm, sophisticated, caring, well organized , passionate to the point of being infectious, a patient listener and a witty person who will make you want to be his friend. With his wit and humor, he will make you addicted to be in his company. One of the brightest and brilliant minds of the campus, this person is also one of the top CGPA holders, and a great photographer. Sometimes it is hard to believe that he has clicked a photo himself, or downloaded it from internet. OK ... sometimes it might be the later case... but mostly it is the first one.... :P . He also plays table tennis, his very perfect backhand, has made many people lose their interest in this game (and I am not talking about myself... I can beat you down anytime you ask me to :) ). A great person to be in company with, has also been a moral support many times. He is gifted with an efficient style of studying. Academics is not the only field he excels at but extra curricular activities too. If he were a nerd, I would mention that here, but I simply cannot. He has an English accent, which will make you want to jump out of the window (I mean it is so good, that you will feel ashamed of yourself... not the other way!!!). A childish, yet mature friend, he is always there to help you at difficult times. A very emotional person, not at all egoistic, and also hard-working, and above all also very talented. Does not worry much... always cool-headed. One can learn a lot from him about his lifestyle, to the extent that he may write a complete book with title "The way to live life!!!". When somebody says, "Go get a life!!", I am sure he must be talking of a life like the one he has :D. God has given this deserving person so much, and I hope that he continues to do so. I have always felt lucky to have found a friend like you, since the day I met you. Hope you continue to be my friend in future too. I hope that you and I soon meet in silicon valley, with our own companies next to each other, or maybe even in "our" own company. Hope the best for your future life. Be in touch... :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyesh-shrivastava">Priyesh Shrivastava</a></p>
<p>There are some friends with whom you seldom talk but are close to heart. Nishant is one of them. We met for the first time in lib(i know it's a strange place to make friends :P)in 1-1 but from then one we became good friends.Nishant is one of those people who study in full relaxation mode. I have never seen him tensed about anything.He maintains his calm in every situation.People in today's world find it hard to appreciate people but Nishant does not belong to that group.Ever ready to help you, be it acads or any other techie stuff. Creative, Artistic and Emotional. His poems speaks for his heart, photographs taken by him tells a tale and sketches made by him just attracts you. It came as a big surprise to me when I saw my sketch made by him. Thank you so much Nishant, for being a wonderful friend .I am sure you are gonna achieve all that which you wish for. We have had some wonderful memories in BITS and I hope we have many more in future. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>
<p>Nishant Agarwal for people and Nishu for me is undoubtedly my best friend. when i met him for the first time we just exchanged formal hi and hello. It was only after Jaundice Holidays that we talked dil khol kar(life discussion, 4c2 joke, 2baby-father joke,'CG ho' song,writing orkut testimonial 4 each other,scrap competition and many more things :D) when there was hardly anyone in the corridor. And from then there was no turning back. Nishu is friendly, hardworking and intelligent. Singing, sketching, photography, poetry, he is good(perfect for me) at all of them. He is a patient listener( i think this quality has to be there in all my friends to bear my bakwaas :P). Whenever I need someone to spend time with, I instantly knock his door. Whenever I need to share something which I can't share with everyone I go to him because I trust him blindly. And even he shares his thoughts, feelings and everything with me which makes me feel important. He has helped me a lot in every aspect and I want to thank him for that. Sometimes I was rude(ob my fault :( ) but he has always forgiven me...in future where ever we are gonna be, u will always remain my best friend. And there is no point of missing each other because we will meet whenever we want (kyun hai na?). I wish you all the very best for your future and i am sure you will achieve all that you wish for... :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sandeep-sharma">Sandeep Sharma</a></p>
<p>Nishant ! :-D :-D .There are some friends who simply get you and complement your mood without any effort, for whom, you don't have to work an inch for maintaining the friendship because you know that it will blossom because of the inexplicable mutual understanding  ! :) Well, Nishant is one such precious friend of mine ! :) As a person, I am just stunned by the number of talents he has been bestowed with - Acads, photography, sketching, writing poetry, singing , even dancing and i know i am forgetting some more for sure! And since you have done all of them for me or with me, I can admiringly tell that there's a concoction of artistic touch, patience and passion in whatever you do ! Being a quick learner, they come out pretty seeming to be effortless too :-D.. Well all this is just general gyan about him which all of us know ! Talking about the two of us- there's plenty to cherish and smile for, ain't it? From the library hours together to the yawning together in Bharat Deshpande's 'blup-blup'  disco lecture sessions, from the venting out our joys and sorrows at almost any time possible to the little miscommunications in between, our friendship has only grown ! :-D How can I forget the day when you mustered up some courage to ask me out for prom ! I ll never forget the 'butterflies-in-my-stomach' sensation that came along..:-D The humble, decent and handsome guy that you are, you did your 200% in making it a memorable and fun night ! :-D Also, the salsa-workshop !  Concentrate on the steps and the music runs away from you! Listen to the music carefully and oops!! What were we supposed to do !! :P :P BTW, I am still banking on you to remind me of the steps so that something good can come out of it :P..
I can continue blabbering more about the little -little things we did together ! But let our minds do the rest of the work ! :) All i have to say is that you are one wonderful friend I have made here ! Be in touch with me , wherever you are across the globe ! And I am sure , you ll shine ! May the stars be with you ! :-D Cheers Femto ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gargi-biswas">Gargi Biswas</a></p>
