<h1 class="page-title">Nisheeta Desai</h1><p>Nisheeeee ( tats wat her frenz cal her, not me :P ). I say she is my partner in winning th noble prize for our work on bose-einstein condensate. ;) Se is one of the sweetest persons i ve ever met. Nevr gets angry, for all i kno. Very pretty girl. I still rememb admiring her looks back in 1-1( now im too used 2 seeing her everyday :P ) For all those who think she jus smiles, she is capable of doing a lot of other things too. I must admit, she is extremely talented. A good dancer n a singer! An awesome carrom player (Thanku for training me in carrom. I shall make u proud someday :P ) Most of all, she is awesome at imitating ppl, specially AVK n CDS! If u ve known her personally, thn u wud surely have notice how good a listner she is!! Tats how v get along so well :) Academically excellent! She is one person who has survived in BITS by bathing daily n sleepin at most by 11pm! Yes! she is a disciplined gal, fun to hangout wit n u ve made my physics year, worth remembering! It has always been a pleasure studying wit u :D Cheers to the fun times v ve had so far. (der r many more 2 come)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ranjita-pai-kasturi">Ranjita Pai Kasturi</a></p>
<p>My dearest neighbor! The first time I met her, after having moved into our new rooms in first year, she was so shy, and we were both getting terribly homesick, so there wasn’t much room for talk. :P  But since then, we have been the best of friends, and so similar in our tastes, it’s a miracle to have found someone who agrees with me on almost all accounts! She is quiet, intelligent, with knowing eyes, and very sensitive. Beautiful (with extraordinary hair :)  ), funny, smart, and very talented, she and I can talk about music, Marathi theatre, movies and art, and I love the fact that we share the same background and homely traditions, because that is what made us understand each other so well. In spite of her excellence in academics, she is humble and very helpful – the only memorable part of Opti was studying it together, Nishi! She reads deep books, listens to classical music, and puts her heart and soul into studying Physics. She sings beautifully, and I shall miss her echoing voice in the corridor outside, when we’re no longer on campus.. :(
I am sure she will attain great heights, and may success be showered upon her, for she deserves the best, without question! All the best, Nisheeta, and never lose touch, I am so glad to have known you!

<p>Walk into an early morning class and Nisheeta is one of the few people who will surely be there. (The only other person being Nisheeth) The way she routinely sleeps and wakes up on time, keeps her room tidy and watches only one movie in about a month! Hats off to you for that! She seldom teases anybody when we are sitting among friends and pulling each other’s leg, but when she does, believe me, she hits home and leaves you speechless :). After a whole semester and more of borrowing her water bottle during classes (which she always remembers to carry for us thirsty ones) and then apologizing for finishing the water, I finally took to the habit of carrying around my own; and when I still forget she lends me hers with a huge smile. It is interesting to see her curse the teachers or situations in her own sweet way. Mimicking them is one thing, and she is doubtlessly good at it. You have been a wonderful friend and you know that right? :P :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/surbhi-khetrapal">Surbhi Khetrapal</a></p>
<p>Nisheeta !! :-D :-D BEAUTIFUL - inside out ! :-D Both of us have been each others shadow since the past year; we went to all the same classes, took the same electives and also the same audit course and to make the list more crazy, we have the same dual too, we have done the same projects under the same person and are looking forward to working on the same project in summer too! I fear the day , when both of us will be placed and will be frowned upon for taking freaking similar courses together, nothing distinct ! :-O Jokes Apart, 'Nisheeta' is one name that brings a smile to my face :) , a sense of composure and reassurance to my mind and lots of affection in my heart  for her ! :-D One can never be tensed around her ! She stands out due to her not-so-typical-hostelite-attitude' ! Meaning- She goes to sleep not later than 10:30 P.M even in the third year, wakes up early in the morning, feels uncomfortable in her first class of the day if she hasn't taken a bath, doesn't like loud english music, instead prefers the quality classical versions over it ,etc. She chooses her words wisely! Her silence at apt places speaks volumes.You'll never find her bitching ! :) She reaches out to you genuinely anytime you would require! Very disciplined and hardworking and yet knows how to have fun ! Basically one gets the point! She is the ideal friend one can have ! :-) Its been real fun sharing lab-hours with you, studying with you , singing along with you and  just being around with you ! An awesome imitator, especially of A.V,K and Gaurav Dar sir! Thanks for making this year smooth for me and also the assurance of the same for the coming year ! :-D
Wish you everything awesome in life  and also that we remain good friends ! :-D Cheers ! :-D

<p>Nishi!!…I remember the first time we went for dinner together, she finished in less than 10 mins and I was still on my first chapatti! and when I was like “God! I have to learn how to eat fast!”  She comes across as a very shy and meek girl who stays to herself when you first meet her but as you get to know her better and bond better you realize how wrong u were. She is the most cheerful person I know, always smiling, and laughing, soft spoken and lives mostly in her physics world. She is an amazing singer and knows the lyrics to almost every song and still doesn’t mind it when I sing the wrong lyrics sometimes (and then we end up making an altogether new song :P ) She has keen interests in photography, art, literature and is extremely fond of instrumental music. She is a very patient listener (that’s how we bonded so well I guess :P ;) ) and is always ready for some stupid impulsive masti!! Very scared of horror movie (remember paranormal activity :P) but can be a little scary herself when she opens her hair :P (kidding!.. u have beautiful hair! )Will always remember the sunday morning discussions and talks we had in her room and the chemistry, physics group study sessions where we would start with physics and chemistry and end up on some random topic or mostly songs. She is in love with PHYSICS.. seriously nishi!!.. how? :P and I still hold on to wat I say abt physics ppl.. ;) While most of us have been affected by the bitsian lifestyle and the latenighters, she stills sleep by 11 pm and is up by 6:30 am!! All in all, it has been great to have you as a best friend nishi. The time to goodbye hasn’t yet come so we’ll save all the senti goodbyes for later but yea, for now, will wish you good luck in whatever you do! Lots of love-Dish

<p>Nishi…a very good friend since 8th grade….these 8 years seem to have just sped by and I only wish that I had some more time to spend with you. I was quite overwhelmed I must say when on the first day on campus I bumped into you during the hostel allotments. I was more glad when you came to stay diagonal to my room…I thought this was the best that could have happened to me…old school friends back together for the next four years (or rather five cz I was a dualite too initially back then)… I always knew staying away from home would be difficult but your nice, caring and amicable nature helped me get through this difficulty over the past three years. When I initially befriended you back in the school days I admired your hair so thick and dense….it makes you look so beautiful you’ve got no clue about that…Anyway Nishi has always been an academically sound girl and being in MSc Physics herself she was the one who helped me get through both of Physics 1 and Physics 2 and not to forget Modern Physics which I had as my elective. I still remember the days of workshop in the second semester of college when you me and Megha used to sit a day before the exam to learn all the chapters only to be able to make up convincing stories in the paper later :P…Those were some of the moments that I ll cherish in my life as I look back to my college days….the fun we used to have while studying together for the WS exam with Claire de Lune and Meadows playing in the background and also not to forget the fun we used to have in the Workshop labs, us being fortunately  in the same section. Most importantly Nishi has been one friend who has encouraged me to learn instead of worrying about grades so much. She has made me believe in the fact that grades cannot decide or quantify the knowledge you can have in a particular subject and that is what I have begun to believe ever since then. Thanks to you for that!! Her determination with which she ends up acing every course has never failed to amaze me. She is a very sweet girl who will never say no to anything that you propose to do be it chit chat or go out for a walk on the campus…she’ll oblige to all of it. Now she is a girl with a very quiet nature. Nishi will not easily talk to someone (even if she knows him from school that is to say). She can barely stand up to anything wrong that may happen around her especially if someone shouts at her she’ll simply just listen to it without a word even if that might have hurt her a lot. Now I wouldn’t say it’s a flaw but yes I would be totally glad to see this part of her change just so that it makes her a stronger person to face the world outside. She has always been a great company in the journey back home at the end of each semester and it feels sad that you won’t be there anymore to accompany me back home. She is a Physics lover and will do anything to devote the rest of her academic life to this subject. Oh ya! Her contribution towards teaching me Marathi also needs a mention here. Eight in years in Mumbai and I couldn’t learn this language and three years in college Nishi just taught it to me well enough to be able to comprehend it. That makes you simply an awesome friend!! However, sadly I haven’t been able to teach you so much Bengali as I have done to Kinu. I can’t help but laugh when I try to remember the first time you tried to speak in Bengali.  What you said ended up meaning something entirely weird and different. She is a firm believer in Old is Gold. Listening to old songs, watching old movies is what she likes to do in her leisure time or even reading novels for that matter…she can just not be found idle unlike some of us who roam around being utterly jobless sometimes. She has a very sweet voice and can sing very well. We took our music audit course together and she simply excelled in it too. She loves to sing or hum musical tunes as she walks along the corridor. How I am to going to miss it Nishi I can’t tell you during these six months. Nishi is a very well disciplined girl who lives a very disciplined lifestyle. Gets up early in the morning, attends all classes, studies in time, has her meals on time and sleeps early by 10-10.30. Initially I tried adopting the same lifestyle but it failed miserably. She is great at playing carom too. You tried teaching me but it ended up with no results sadly :( She played for spree and will admit that has been able to make us all proud. She was also a member of Abhigyaan. She just loved teaching those kids and with her sweet and soft nature was able to make a place for herself in their heart. The kids are so fond of her even now. This girl leaves me spell bound with her awesomeness in every way!! Nishi always stay in touch which you very seldom do once you get back home….So I’ll emphasise that keep in touch. Stay the same and keep spreading happiness everywhere. Hope you do well in life. Best of luck for the future and may you continue to make people proud around you. Love you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Nisheeta Desai ! the sweet adorable person i was aware of till quiet recently a few MUP classes and year of physics courses got me to know the charming personality hidden in her . She is like an oyster , when opened radiates the pearls of fun and friendship around her ! She is so awesome at mimicing profs ! and loves doing it ! A very enjoyable company to keep she achieves perfection in her work with an altogether different stride which only she can pull off well. The time which enters a morning class marks the short achievable deviation ! I am awed by her sense of discipline and hair lovely thick hair . I am sure in her own steady way she will make it big in the world of physics ! One of the most memorable friends i have made in BITS in quiet a short span of time .Hope that it just gets better in the times  to come :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>

<p>Nishi…the first thing I’ll say about her is that she’s my cute little billi ;) The way she ‘matkaofies’ her eyes is soooo adorable ;) Nishi was the first friend I met in campus, just outside her hostel and I remember she was as nervous as me (although now she claims that’s not so…which is not true!!!). Although we are almost completely opposite, she has become one of my best friends now.
Nishi is one of those calm, serene people who seem like they are descended from the land of peace, I have rarely seen her panicking.  And she is one of sweetest people you’ll ever meet. In the first meeting, she may come across to you as shy, but once you get to know her, there is a naughty little girl who likes to mimic teachers and tease friends with their crushes. She’s got the most amazing masses of curly hair I’ve ever seen (remember we used to try to find their spring constant... :P :P). She shares my love for music although her type of variety is more oldies and instrumentals and to complement that, she’s got a really sweet voice, and it’s a pleasure to listen to her singing and also her playing (all those who don’t know, she plays the keyboard also :)). Its amazing how she still hasn’t become spoilt like us- sleeping late at nights and bunking the next day’s classes; nishi religiously got to bed by 11 and wakes up by 6am. That’s why I have asked her to be my alarm clock so many times during the exams.  She’s a complete fan of physics, which I would say is very rare in girls…way to go nishi…u are halfway to becoming Sheldon Cooper (:P :P, since u don’t like experimental physics :P). I remember I used to sit in front of her and cry before our physics exams and she always used to explain stuff to me very patiently (which ultimately came of no use as I got a C in both courses…) . nishi, its been really great, these three years, and we have one more year ahead of us, jisme we’ll have all classes together.. its gonna be so much fun :)
Love u nishi…always stay the same..cheerful and smiling :) :)

<p>Nishiii…a person who brings a smile on your face everytime, a person whom I respect for the amount of sincerity and hardwork she puts into everything,a person whom I love seeing laugh..yes,that is nisheeta. Very quiet and simple…her simplicity leaves a great impact on you. The only person I know who sleeps and wakes up at proper time..has a very beautiful voice , just like her ? Though she speaks less, do not mistake her to boring…not at all..she is so much fun to be with.  Even when I don’t say something stupid (like I usually do :P:P), she still laughs her heart out..i don’t have to make much effort in making her laugh. She is so good at imitating people , had so many fun sessions of that. always calm and composed ,there are so many things that one can learn from you..there is so much to write for you, but then I ll just end with saying that ‘please do not change, always enjoyed making you laugh, that feeling of happiness just cannot be expressed in words”..love you loads nishi..:)?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
