<h1 class="page-title">Nisheeth Bandaru</h1><p>In a class full of Einstein's , when I saw realized there was yet another genius forcing his way into completing an added unnecessary degree on Msc Physics, having aced EEE already ,  I was nothing but screwed by the very thought it ! :-O Besides, there was this fear of encountering a senior in class ! On the contrary, when I first met Nisheeth , I liked him at once, all my notions lefts me running far away ! l:) He is this very friendly, very helpful and always smiling even in the midst of a crisis kind of a guy to me ! :) The way he equips himself in a boring class  simply amazes me !  Either he ll be 'KINDLE-ing' stuffs , or else if that is missing, his android will do the job - be it reading ebooks or playing guitar or keyboard on it ! :) Being a senior, he surprisingly attended all the classes that too in time , along with the Nisheeta.( I think it has got to do with the word 'Nisheet' :P..) One just has to start a conversation with him and he ll sail through ! Thanks for making my life least intimidating  than I expected it to be and a lot easier and full of fun ! Today I realised that he'll be actually leaving us next year and the thought actually saddens me which is why he deserves this testimonial !:) Always be in touch ! Keep doing lots of extra courses like physics and like the one related to MIT ,etc:P.. Wish you all the success in life !
