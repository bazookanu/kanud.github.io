<h1 class="page-title">Nithin S Poduval</h1><p>A nice, friendly, easy-going guy! Nitin in a really hard-working person, and ambitious as well. A die-hard Metallica fan, lover of Folk Metal songs, he has a knack for discovering great bands and songs....Come exam time, whenever I pass his room, I am instantly pacified by "Fade To Black", 'Unforgiven', or 'Nothing Else Matters' which he has going on his speakers.His guitar playing too is very soothing and cool. And yes, Podu, the band is on!! Wish you a successful future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>

<p>A friendly, hard-working and extremely dedicated person. He has a way of getting into comical situations (most notable would be the "workshop incident" :P) He has a knack of excelling in almost everything be it sports (badminton, chess and football), playing the guitar, quizzing or acads. Wish you all the best in your future endeavours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ben-thomas">Ben Thomas</a></p>

<p>Nithin Poduval - One of my first mallu friends in BITS and a fellow Mech buddy :). He is one of the craziest metal fans I have met. He really enjoys the music he likes and in a concert, he makes sure he enjoys the atmosphere to the fullest and even if very few people are up in front, Poduval will surely be headbanging and swaying to the beat. Another quality of his is his hardworking nature. He makes sure there is no stone unturned in his preparation. After all this, he is still a very down to earth and helpful person. I remember at times, there are just 20 mins left for the exam to start, and Poduval will gladly explain a concept to me or clear my doubt even though he might have some syllabus of his own to revise. It was fun sharing the same branch and the same corner of the corridor with you. Keep rocking and stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>

His sincere replies to all your questions just shows how much he values the other person....there are many such  rare nd special qualities in you Poduval.....no matter what..never change!!!

<p>Podu is probably the most innocent guy I have known. He's always there to help you with your studies or any other thing you ask for. Every time We din't understand something before an exam we would run to his room in the last minute to ask for help, and he would never say 'no'.I am so glad he's mechanical.He's a big fan of metal and hard rock. He's very talented, good at acads, guitar, badminton, chess and football. Sometimes he's bit absent minded:P We also share the same birthdays so I always had someone to share the Bums and treats :)
Had great times togehter!Will miss you da! Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
