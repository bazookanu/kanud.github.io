<p>Ama yaar , well none of your testimonials should start without this. Cheerful & jolly person, enjoys life to the fullest. Always there for friends, for help & for those /\ jokes(pjs mostly). Always said he has so much to tell but no way of telling. Let me tell you something my friend when you are amongst friends there is no need to tell we understand.    <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-palasgaonkar">Vishal Palasgaonkar</a></p>
<p>Amma as we all call him, is my dearest frnd on campus. You can nevr be irritated or be angry on this guy. A very simple guy with tons of laziness combined with almost a habit of sleeping with his specs on topped with a genuine care for his frndz with his irritating tendency to play the same song in an infinite loop for hours and hours becomes the best frnd you can ever get. Will be missing you like anything next semester ama.  best of luck for the future. ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranay-agrawal">Pranay Agrawal</a></p>
<p>This guy is from a different world. He has his own ways of doing everything which others can't even think of adopting. Only he can pull them off. He is scared of none and is never influenced by anyone. He might not be very open when it comes to talking to different people but he would do anything his friends. And by any thing I mean he may even give up on the same aforementioned unconventional ways if his friend disapproves of them. He loves maths,  loves solving puzzles and teasers. He is a pro-coder and quick learner when it comes to anything related to computers and stuff. He is a big cricket fan and wont miss even one match of India and even IPL. He loves playing cricket too. He is ever-enthusiastic when it comes to going out on long road trips(I know I have disappointed you on this a number of times). An extremely honest person who won't hold himself back while expressing himself about something. A very confident person who always knows what he is doing. A unique personality. You will always be different..All the best for the future :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>
<p>Nitin yaar...it has been an great experience to have been your neighbour for the past three years...always a fun guy to have around.. you can always be guaranteed of an interesting conversation whenever you meet him....a very simple and straight forward person with an ambition of doing something great in life...our discussions on Zuckerberg, Google guys, Bill Gates and how we too should try out something great were, needless to say, awesome fun (hopefully  we ll at least give it a try)...overall a truly "lite" person who never gets stressed no matter what...will be missing you next sem and wish you all the best for the future<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-deshpande">Aditya Deshpande</a></p>
<p>We keep using the phrase "extremely good at heart" . But when you meet this guy you actually the sense the meaning of it . Happy - go - lucky wala dude hai :D always tries to be cheerful :) .. a touch sensitive but that goes into his good qualities . A big big cricket enthusiast , and would never miss an India match for any reason . A great batsman with his hard swinging shots going out of the ground . He will always ALWAYS stand by his friend no matter what , so if he has trust in you,  feel lucky because you have him by your side in all your good and bad times. Best thing about him is he will never go behind your back , extremely straight forward :P can be harmful to people he doesnt like , but that list is extremely small . I am sure your smart and jolly nature is going to take you a long long way . cheers :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-das">Varun Das</a></p>
<p>Nitin is the proest guy I have met since coming here in BITS. BC even doesn't attend classes and still ends up getting Avg+10/15 in his exams. Starts learning some shit like Android and finishes all the video tuts and even completes some project in 2-3 days. God level brain _/\_.Needless to speak about his love for Cricket and his gully cricket skills.  I still remember our endless exams where you sat next to me and helped me save my ass. Thanks for that. I dont need to say that you will phodufy what ever you do in life . Coz you will. Be the awesome guy you are. Always.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>

<p>Nitin is what he calls himself... n “Ama” is what people call him coz of his lucknowi-knack of “ama yaar!!”. He is very passionate about cricket n CSK!! (No doubt!! :P). u will never find him studying but he always surprise u with his exam scores!! He has sharp mind as well as superb grasping power... one more thing, never underestimate him, else he will again surprise u with all his will n dedication (believe me, he got a hell of it!!). he is great admirer of Dhoni!! ( he is such a big fan that he took “Dhoni” as his report topic in CLEO :D :D). He is also _/\_ of computer programming... which i don’t even understand 1% of it :P. i bet he can do any kinda coding, be it, creating his own OS (someday :P)!!! His passion speaks for him, but the ego is still grounded : ). He always stands by his friends despite of being good or bad time. He is a great enthusiast of gully cricket (ever-ready to play!!). his passion n dedication has gained him a lot of respect from my side. I still remember him playing carom in our very first week of meet :D.. u were named.. “destructive man” ... n i said on repeatedly.. “if u can.. only then u shud!! :D” those will remain as memories : ). He has got the speciality to turn grudges in to more of friendship... thats y none can stay away from u for long : ). It was real pleasure to have u around.. wishing u best for ur future.. : )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nilesh-bhala">Nilesh Bhala</a></p>
<p>Nitin also popularly known as ama yaar is one of the laziest yet shrewdest people I have known. This guy is the epitome of happy-go-lucky nature and over-enthusiasm. He is also the master of jugaad technology and has a penchant for programming. One of the very few guys who genuinely like programming and algorithms. Apart from his prowess he is also known for his love of cricket, and the frequent outbursts of high-pitched shrieks that can be heard hostels away. First impression he leaves is that of an introvert, but once you get to know him well he can be incessantly (to the point of annoyance) talkative. However you can always count upon him in your time of need, unless he is going home which he does atleast twice every semester :P. 
<p>Here's a toast to the endless hours of chudaap, your tasteless sastas, the times when you could barely explain and I have to act as an interpreter :P, to all the trips in and around goa, to the not attending CS classes, to disco/toc/consys and all other CS CDCs, to underarm cricket, the train journeys back home and to all wonderful moments of the past three years. Best wishes, stay in touch :).
