<h1 class="page-title">Nitish Sinha</h1><p>Nitish Sinha is a great guy. In a party full of people, he is the silent killer standing in a corner with a glass of wine and style. He is a fine sportsman. Be it football or cricket, he is the guy you are looking out for if you are in the opposite team! He is very informative about the recent changes going on in the technology and that is one of the best things about him. All in all, he is one of my best friends and worth remembering even when I grow up to 30-40 year old!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
