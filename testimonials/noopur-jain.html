title: Noopur Jain

<h1 class="page-title">Noopur Jain</h1><p>She is an awesome person. Balancing both academics and her campus life, she stands as an example for people who juggle it all. Having been a part of Arts & Deco and DOFAM, she contributed a lot to the festivals on campus. With her smile she wins over everyone and makes her friends feel special. What makes her a good colleague and an even better friend is that even if she has a project submission tomorrow, she will spend time with you when you need her. All in all, a great person.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Lovely Lovely Mermaid ! She is a sweetheart. She will make you feel the best with her sweet talk. She is a person who can make you remember anything in the world .. She has such a  prodigious memory !!! As lovely and sweet , quick minded , she can predict the emotion of a person standing right before her in no time. Piss her off you can never imagine to win ... Flatter her with all praises .. She will love it :P .. Very fair minded ,disciplined and girl with strong will . She is the one who can get up at 5AM in BITS and take a bath :D  . Lovely as she is .. difficult to ignore her ( she can never let u ignore  otherwise :P ) .  Had a wonderful time with u Mermy ! One of the things I would miss when I leave BITS is our friendship and the time we spent talking , mainchatting ;) , Paratrooping on Calangute :D. . . . .

<p>she will always be there for you.You can drop by her room for a friendly chat and with her happy-go-lucky nature she will keep you engaged for hours.A very talented girl which is evident from her dedicated work for Arts and Deco.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>Noopur, as her name is, she is one with always smiling face... As everyone says, she is silent assassin. An academic phodu, dedicated Arts n Deco member, expert in JAVA, and with helping attitude... one of the great people in IS, the rapport we got in 2-2 started growing in 3-1, became stronger with the seminar, I still remember the long talks we three used to have, the problem-solving session, the amazing tr8 at dominoes, SE project or the endless talks, anything and everything, wish you a great journey ahead, All the best... :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>Got to know Noopur through EEEP labs. As Dheeraj would keep doing all the experiments me, Noopur and Sakshi timepass ki baatein karte the :D. From then on what I saw was a phodu girl (in all aspects), once upon a time DC celeb :P, dedicated, attends every class, I mean, how much patience can one have to endure that kind of a torture ? Other than these ideal student characteristics, she always comes across as one with a smiling face, kind at heart, and really helpful. It'd have been great if you'd have taken ps in first sem :), would have had a nice tour guide for Bglr too :P. With all those traits that you've got, you'll go places. So all the best for your future, and thanks for having the patience to endure 10 clicks during farewell (either I'm way too un photogenic, or... well, it's Dheeraj's fault :P). Your friendship will always be cherished as one of those few really good first friends in IS 2k9 I got to know :) and make sure you stay in touch :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/goutham-harsha">Goutham Harsha</a></p>
<p>Noopur... my  first close friend in campus...and someone who even today never fails to bring a smile to my face...  Is one of the most supportive friends i have ever had…. She is a sincere person and gives her 100 percent to whatever she gets into… be it her academics…be it watching make it or break it ( :P ) , arts and deco or her  friendship…   What I like most about her is that she is a very patient listener and is probably the only one who can listen to my never-ending gibberish. She believes in living in the moment, and when she is having fun… boy she goes crazy! ?.She is a beautiful person both inside and outside, someone who can make people feel nice about themselves when they are at their lowest and lift them to heights unknown when they’re ecstatic… College life wouldn’t be the same without you in it…  Every memory with you is priceless… I still remember  our first year days, getting late for thermo class and telling the prof that the milk in the mess was too hot, fighting over how many mothers dolly had,  looking for your perfect TDH ? , our great panjim outing where we walked all over the place with an upside down map, your recent birthday bash on a tsunami alert night! Boy we have had some awesome times… and many more to come.. cause I am never gonna give up a friend as special as you! Love you gal!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>One day the Almighty was busy doing his managerial work, and suddenly an angel popped in. In a hesitating voice he said,"Sir, i am really interested in doing an LOP under you next sem.. can I do a project under you?".. God stopped tying on his laptop, and his eyes sparkled with a faint smile on his face.. looked as if he did had some difficult task at hand.He said,"Ofcourse you can do one.. Yo have to prepare the most ideal human being, a perfect mixture of all qualities.. will you be able to do it?"
Drops of sweat came running down his cheek, still he agreed to do that tough job, for the sake of a good cv (:P). Hardworking as he was , he mixed a bag of diligence with intelligence in a bowl of artistic talent, and added gallons of sweetness , sense of humour and a tint of an inexplicable charm...which he baked in an oven of care... Thus my friends.. "Nups was prepared!!" ..  Stories apart, now some senti stuff, Nups , as I call her, I first met in the library, in my first trip to that place.. how a faint "hi" then, transformed into such a strong bond, I really do not know... As pointed out, You maintain the most immaculate balance of acads and life which is real inspiring.. her sweet smile and motivating talks possess the power of cheering any person up! cheers to the memorable moments we spent, and cheers to our friendship! May all your dreams come true! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>
<p>She insists she and I wouldn't be friends today if I hadn't first talked to her ... I am sure it's not true, for, you see, Noopur Jain isn't the kind who doesn't make friends (such as me!!), she's the kind who does. So here we are, wonderful friends, our friendship has only strengthened as these 3 years have gone by. I believe I'm the only friend who she hasn't had a "big" fight with (lucky me, as I always say!). Moving right along, I remember the late night walks in which we talked our hearts out, arguing, discussing, bitching about others, psychoanalyzing each other (she never could win that one :P), she coaxing me to sing and me refusing...oh the list wouldn't end ever. but I sure gave her like a 1000 recitals of Bhaja Govindam. I know she hated those. In turn, however, she has pakaofied me with her endless monologues. so we're even, i guess. 
Knowing you, and having you for a friend, means a lot to me. You have seen good things in me when others have seen bad. You have my gratitude for appreciating my poems. that means more to me than you can imagine.  Finally, Let me thank you, for being a friend. That's all one ever needs. 
Of course, as you'll read in each of her testimonials, she's great at painting, she's a phodu in acads, a great dancer- i AM sure, but above all, a wonderful person, kind at heart and sweet and nice and caring. And Yes, she dreams big - am proud of that! May you have every dream fulfilled as you go along your way in life, make a tonne of real friends and achieve everything that you're capable of. That's all I wish for you! The world WILL know the great person that you are!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
<p>It was DC where i first spoke to the ~Mermaid~, who was too excited of her b'day doing some crap (Oh yeah u were dng dat :P), and ended up talking for some hours on gtalk. Then onwards she made a really great friend. She is funny, sweet, interesting and yeah talkative also. I have always seen her strive hard for her success. She loves a lot of TV series most of them unheard :P .She's an artist and i guess she loves it, maybe that's why she used to even skip both meals for ArtsnD during fests( or maybe she must be dieting). And no surprise even if she does all timepass, sleeps a lot blah blah she's good in her acads. Also she is good in photography, loved her random pics which she took in PS1. To the end i should say she's a Balanced girl but "Bimbo" would sound good haha.

Noopur Jain aka Napud aka Ritu aka Mermaid...God!!!!...how many of such nicks she has???...I knew her name first when I saw it just before my name once, in an attendence sheet...then thought..she might be my team mate in labs, assignments and might help this lazy soul...and see what happened...It was in 1st year when I got lucky to become friends with this highly gifted living being when missfastforward introduced me to her...Now, she is one of my best friends who really helps me a lot in almost everything I do, even in advising what to gift someone in his/her(sry only her ;)) birthday...She tolerates all my pakau stories and used to advise and still does after hearing those..which obviously being a bawlo I never follow...She is a very hard working girl who will surely reach some unreached heights in her life by fulfilling her dreams...We fight a lot..most of the times about stupid worthless things...but we still are friends and will be forever...(koi toh chahiye na STORIES sunne wala ;))..all d best for future.. :)...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sandeep-sharma">Sandeep Sharma</a></p>

<p>Noopur!! My IS mate!! :) She is an amazing person. Always helpful..be it giving notes, asking doubts or any other thing. She will never say 'no' and is a very down to earth person. She is undoubtedly very intelligent and has excelled in acads. It was really great meeting a person like you. And had a real blast at Arambol and ya not to forget, u copied me really well that day!:P :D Wishing you all the very best in future. Have fun. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>
<p>I met Noopur first on DC, and saw her in real when Archana pointed towards her in mess. She told me that Noopur was an excellent debater. But after that, having met due to ‘Gola Barood family’ and due to being in same branch, I finally got to know her better.  Noopur is one of the most selfless girls I have ever known. She is always smiling, even if she is in trouble. She tries her best to help you out. And mind you, she is not just an excellent orator, but also an excellent artist (she is in Arts and Deco). And of course, she is also really good at academics. (itni sincerity ke sath marks aane tou bante hain :) ) I really had a fun time being with her. Wish you all the luck in life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-bajpai">Vibhor Bajpai</a></p>
<p>noopur!!!! With her name comes her very cute, always smiling face into my mind!!!! I find her really very sweet, sober, down to earth and intelligent human being.. She is very calm, composed and cool minded person who i never find tensed or nervous or anything even during exam times!!!! :) a thing which i really appreciate.. She is very determined, focused and sincere towards her academics and manages her co-curricular activities equally well be it arts and deco or anything else.. It has always really been a fun talking to her.. in person or dc (gola barood family :P).. I would always cherish the time we have spent together.. especially chem 1 classes where we used to sit together most of the times and 'pay attention towards Dr. SUJIT GHOSH'S lectures' (yeah.. u got it right.. its pretty much sarcastic :P).. I wish you all the very best and may you achieve all your dreams :)..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/barkha-gupta">BARKHA GUPTA</a></p>
<p>Noopur …. The first girl in campus with whom I talked. She was so considerate in workshop that she did the shaper and lathe job almost by herself (Thanks for that :D) Our CG was the same till the end of 1-2. And then she started phodufying. She is rightly called ‘the silent killer’ of IS. A very humble, dedicated and hardworking girl, she is always ready to help you out. Loves watching movies because whenever I ask her on Gtalk (It’s difficult to find her as she is invisible most of the times :P), she replies I am watching a movie. Always has a smile on her face and is full of positivity. Wish you all the best for your future endeavours and do keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Noopur can be described in a few words like focussed, practical, and fun loving... She is one of the few seniors to whom you can look up to for any kind of help, be it acads or other problems. She is a very patient listener and knows her way with most of things. Shes the teacher's favourite ( even of CHANDRAM !! mother of god!! ) and likes phodufying subjects with her determination and focus which i seriously respect...  a bit moody but simple hearted person who will be a true friend if you are true to her... ( i learnt this from the sunsign web page u had sent me) ... seniors 2K9 batch _/\_ !! wish you all the best for the future and keep smiling!!   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashish-behera">Ashish Behera</a></p>
<p>Noopur is one of the very few girls i know on campus. Starting from 2nd year when we were in the same POM group. Then in 3rd year during OB presentations, assignments etc, one thing I have admired all along is her hard work and dedication for anything she does and that is truly commendable. She is very helping and soft spoken by nature. She is damn good at acads too and aces the exams. Cheers to all the fun during OB video making ( that was one awesome experience :D ) and thanks for all the help in DBSA labs :P. It was a privilege working with you. Wish you all the best for your future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Hmm ... noopur ..!!  So many times have just disturbed you without any second thought which I generally have on approaching others ...!! This shows how comfortable I m wid you ..
I always manage to speak a lot of senseless in front of u .. and expect you to give me that boring look which i have never seen till date ...!! I sometimes crack some wierdos after 
which i feel ashamed that I really did that .. but the next moment I see you laughing ..  that makes me think .. acha hi hoga ..   :P .. Bahot hasti hai .. pagal hai ...!!!  After 2-1 , I have 
almost stooped asking her ki paper kaisa hua ... Thats a proved way of getting more tensed yourself  ..!!  And yes .. she has a unique ability to change her address every time you ask 
her where she lives .. bangalore , kanpur , lucknow , Mumbai .. etc etc ..Even she is confused ki wo hai kaha ki ..!!  So overall .. a quite chirpy ..smiling girl .. I wish you all the 
deserved luck .. and be the frnd you are always ..!!   :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
