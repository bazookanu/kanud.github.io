<h1 class="page-title">Omkar Kaskar</h1><p>Omi, a very simple, sobre and enthusiastic boy. I came to know him closely much later (in my 3rd year), but nevertheless, he has made me a fan of him. Only a dead-blind won't like his trademark 'ten-teeth' smile. A very dedicated sportsperson, student and friend that this noble guy is all about. If you can't get along with him, you cannot get along with anyone in life. His mannerisms and etiquette would really surprise you. Finally, he reminds me that, though rare, goodness still prevails, comes in "sports packets", like this wonderful creature. I am really honored to be one of you frirends. Wish you all the best for your future endeavours! God Bless!! and Keep Smiling!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>The sweetest guy of the group . Always sporting a child like smile and  carrying  himself with such dignity (I can say this for u " A thousand times over "). A godlike sportsperson (those cricketing shots u played in hostel _/\_ _/\_) and has read a lot of books . A very sincere and a dedicated person ( I remember that in the first year  you were the only person who used to attend extra classes of chemistry). The lavish birthday treat at Martin's was \m/ \m/ .If there was a personality whom I would like to emulate ,it would be you. All the best for your future and have a joyous  fulfilling life. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>

As a friend i admire . him for w all what he is.... he has been a such a good friend and infact much more than that ...i must accept... that he has been responsible for bringing in a galore changes in me...(for the good ofcouse  :P)... My dear friend.... u r 1 person .. who i will never forget to miss out... in my life.. u have added value..in these memorable days of collg..lfe....:) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gautam-s,srinivasan">Gautam S,Srinivasan</a></p>
<p>One of my very good friends in the college to begin with. I would describe him with one word 'Master'

Now coming into some of his qualities for which I will always remember him, hes also an ardent Sachin fan alike myself and a sports enthusiast with a good sound knowledge. Also one of the only 2 people i have seen in this college who can play any game and be damn good at it, a born sportsman be it cricket, table tennis, tennis , carrom or anything else for that matter. If its an outdoor game, u better have this guy in your team. 

Been privileged to share the corridor with him for all these years and wishing him all the very best in his future !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>

<p>Omkar!! This guy is Godsend for me in BITS!! I can't imagine what my last 3 years would have been without him. Whateva be it, this Kaskar was always there for me. He's got a golden heart, is a bit shy :P but is always ready to help. I can't remember ever having heard a NO from him for anything!! I consider myself fortunate to have had him as my next door neighbor for 3 years. It's been a great journey so far... We have one more year left, while some of our near and dear ones leave :P :D But that's life ain't it? Let's hope, we make the best of it! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurabh-nayak">Saurabh Nayak</a></p>

<p>OMI, he is one truly genuine guy. A great friend and someone you will admire for his simplicity. He is calm and down to earth yet passionate for the things he likes or does. Shy at times but knows how to handle things and handle them well. A great cricketer and even better sports person. I remember the first b'day treat of yours in shahi, so messed up it got with the veg n nonveg food. :P :D damn funny it was. It was probably the first bday treat we had on the campus. Was a wonderful experience. It was great knowing you mate and hopefully we will stay in touch even after college is over. All the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>A very good friend of mine..the "good" meaning every letter of it...He has the purest heart possible in all of...donno how big the limit is..His modesty, tolerance and etiquette are a few things more than enough to support my statement. And that's a reason any normal person'd find it good enough to befriend him..Of all that I can think of, his philosophy of living a life is the most appreciable and I respect him for that..He's a true sportsman filled with each and  every bit needed to become perfect in every sport that's honoured by him playing it. He is one of the best cricket players in our college who left his chance of playing for the college team for a reason not very well understood by anyone other than him...His lawn tennis is as good as the best on campus...And one thing I used to and still find very hard to believe is his Table Tennis..which without any formal training is surprisingly professional..And to add to all these he was gifted with sincerity in studies too, just to make the deadly perfect combination...With all these I'm damn sure...he'll have a lot of choices in life to choose in which direction he wants to excel...I don't have to wish a good career and life for him..He'll have it all by himself....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saswat-baruah">Saswat Baruah</a></p>
<p>Perhaps, the only guy in campus who makes me feel much younger than i am. A gentleman,an ardent cricket fan and so on..U wouldn't believe, but sometimes i wish i knew you right from my childhood days. I feel happy having known you. be the person who u are. I hope we stay in touch. God bless.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thomas-abu-c">THOMAS ABU C</a></p>
<p>Omkar is your typical Indian child. He is extremely shy, well mannered, modest, polite, calm, down-to-earth, ever-helpful, sincere, and what not. He is also a great sportsperson. He is an excellent cricket, lawn tennis and TT player. His enthusiasm for cricket and tennis incredible. He likes reading books and is a fellow Potterhead, and Death Note fan (probably the only anime he has ever seen). It has been a great pleasure knowing you. I will always remember that innocent child-like smile of yours, one gem of a personality and of course under-arm cricket. Best wishes for your future. Stay in touch :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
