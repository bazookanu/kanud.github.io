title: Paanini Navilekar
---
<h1 class="page-title">Paanini Navilekar</h1><p>Paani is the subdued kewl dewd. Although an introvert, Paani can get very vocal about topics he feels strongly about, like Delhi, rapes, or... Delhi rapes. A great guitar player, I think I have heard more of Spitleaf when it's being played by him than on my computer. Big Warren worshipper. He is the Linux 'aficionado'(!), my tech advice phellow, and is singularly responsible for the unhealthy amounts of time I spend on twitter, for he introduced me to it. He can be very dedicated if whatever he's doing interests him, you should hear him talk about the people he hates for some free entertainment.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Point number one: I think he is probably the first guy in three centuries to have the name 'Paanini'. Genius. Soft spoken. Always in control. Never wastes an unnecessary word.  He already has that 'enlightened' look that comes only with experience. The filled vessel that never makes any noise. He is a super duper double duper guitarist.The times I have his 'Anuva's Sky' during audi practice!! No words. All the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Paani man! I still remember someone telling me that Paani and I are very alike, and boy, i couldn't agree more! I don't think i share this many things in common with too many other people on this planet! Be it a taste in movies, chiks, food, TV shows, RUSSEL PETERS, a love for twitter, quora, technology, a joint hatred for certain characters, a general love for life; the list is never ending! He's the only guitarist I've seen EVER who could play blackest eyes to perfection, in front of a HUGE crowd while grooving to it on stage like it was moves like Jagger. Paani has the ability to conjure a joke out of thin air and make the situation much, much lighter. I'm going to miss this cleanliness obsessed Linux geek. An amazing technology( and entrepreneurship by the looks of it! :P ) journalist in the making. Here's wishing you the very best! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Paann! ("nn" pronounced as in "Haryann"), hes one of the most cheerful and easy going guys i've come across. One of those very few people who can stand Jinx and Bapu's sastas (given his proximity to them), Paani is that guy who'll laugh at any joke, no matter how bad it is (Remember Gujju/ Bad Jew?). Paani is an amazing guitarist, a twitter celeb and linux phodu. We had an amazing time in Bangalore, and in good preparation for our PS II. We are also unbeatable as a team in Word-games (well only 'donkey'..) and AoE. All the best man! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>Paani, The man with ze 'skilled fingers'. I still remember the first time i heard him play the guitar at the Music Society Auditions in our first year. His bad-ass riffing and sparkly clean soloing blew me away from behind the door. I knew I'd spend a lot of time and enjoy playing music with him. There's no doubt that he's one of the most technically proficient, and absolutely clean guitar players, even with the amount of \m/etchul gain he adds to his tone :P . Covering Warren on Music Night was an absolute treat. The crazy amount of feel he brought out playing Anuva's Sky gave me goosebumps while playing rhythm to him on stage. Needless to say, our time in the music society together has been precious and Paani, thanks for letting me play your guitar while i was stranded with no guitar to play on.
The music side kept aside, Paani is an absolute fun person to chill around, with his snarky remarks and 'good-boy' looks to hide the wickedness. This boy's gonna go a long way with his tech-freak-iness and an OCD to keep everything meticulously clean and in place.
So that's that, now lets go get you some pedals :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aseem-patil">Aseem Patil</a></p>
<p>Paani! Got to know him well only in the 3rd year, better late than never! A fellow EEE victim. One of the most cheerful and laid-back people I've met.Lives life on his own terms.Takes lite but can ace exams if he intends to (I've heard of that Thermo Compre :D). A brilliant guitarist (your rendition of Anuva's Sky was just too good!).Very innocent in appearance. Misleading though.Can take your case rather badly (I've been at the receiving end far too frequently off late!). Extremely polite and humble.A twitter celeb and a Linux lover.One of the most elegant batsmen in our hostel :P (those cover drives with a backlift higher than Brian Lara's :D).I've been a part of a few of those frequent Vasco trips that he and Chhapia have (Sundha's followed by Temptations :D). You make for a great company Paani and its been great knowing you.Long live and Prosper!

<p>Here comes the punani! This guy is deceptively quiet and you only need to bring up Delhi or linux to be witness to that fact. He has skilled fingers and he has used them well in his life. Did I mention he also plays the guitar brilliantly. I feel very safe cracking jokes around this guy, because I know at least he will never fail to burst into simultaneous claps and laughter. He has developed a reputation for laughing at any joke and finding almost any girl cute, but I guess that's what we all love about him. His room is cleaner than...a really clean room, and his wits are sharper than...mine. Thank you for being such a cool spade and laughing at my Gujju/bad jew joke.

<p>The Paan!Whatte guy. Classic geek +excellent guitarist = Deadly combo. Paan pulls off the good-boy act very skilfully, and most students' moms have expressed very vocally how they love the guy for this. Beneath the good boy exterior is a sarcastic, innocent genius. Paani is one of the most brilliant guys on campus. Bad-pun king,absolutely amazing guitarist,  xkcd lover, clean-room OCD, Grammar Nazi, are just some of the thing we love this Ubuntu-freak for. His characteristic laugh and claps at almost any joke are legend. Besides this, Paani is a great ladies' man, and his wall is testimony to that. I've loved all the times we've spent talking all things tech, the twitter conferences with chidlaski, bitching about EEE, Bogmalo ( whenever he's come) and a million other things. Paan's here to stay in tech world, and I hope we'll be sharing jokes and talking about the hot women on twitter even then. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Paanini! The quintessential geek-guitar god. Paani is our very own Mikael Akerfeldt, sans the hair and the beard. His guitar playing has been an inspiration of sorts for me, and i will always remember our Drapery Falls performance, especially for the fact that he SLAYED that solo with such ease. Apart from music, Paanini is the linux whiz kid, who's helped even DRDO's top man Varad with ubuntu installation. We've also shared a few jokes over the three years that no one else has got, and that is pretty cool :P All the best for your future endeavours! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>Paaniiii !! mast sidey to have .A great guitar player and  a true  Blackstratblues fan ( heard him playing anuva sky so many times on his guitar ).I enjoyed chatting with him in my room (rather chatting about other people and unki lene mein ). And of course i will never forget the group study with him. We always used to be in same situation a day before exam. Paani !! do stay in touch with me and good luck for your future  !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saikat-mitra">Saikat Mitra</a></p>
<p>Ahh, Paanini! This is one testimonial I’ve been waiting to write. It’s not every day that you write one for your best friend. And for me, that’s Paani. Firstly, he’s got the most epic name. Paani would probably win a Parent’s Choice Award for anything. He fits the Value Education text-book definition of a good boy. Gora, good-looking, teetotaler, vegetarian, soft-spoken and what not. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath this mask, lies a Delhi-hating, metchul-loving misanthrope with the mightiest arsenal of lame jokes. We first met at the DePP writers inductions. Epic fail that turned out to be. The first thing I thought of when I heard his name was that Russell Peters’ punani joke – but, sadly, Arka  didn’t know him well enough to take up the cause and ruin his life with the same. It was the shared obsession for rock music that really created a friendship. Then I learnt of his legendary ‘skilled fingers’ with which he plucks strings – a guitar’s, mind you. Paani’s probably the most presentable (and only clean-shaven) badass metal guitarist. Also, the only one who kills any solo while doing a highly effeminate jig on stage. Besides these, he’s set the benchmark for rotten taste and bad joke appreciation – bursting into simultaneous claps and laughter at things that aren’t even remotely funny. He could beat Pranky hollow at a room cleaning contest. A linux aficionado, he’s helped me on numerous occasions and I’m sure he’s gonna be picked up by Canonical very soon. 
Of course, I also rue the fact that he’s my friend at times – particularly, the time when my parents had come to visit & they met this bhola-bhala looking, virtuous Kannadiga boy. My mother hasn’t stopped juxtaposing my abysmal personality with Paanini’s seraphic countenance and has been imploring me to emulate him ever since. NOT happening. I could go on and on and I know this is becoming less of a testimonial and more of a goddamn essay with every passing word, but heck, I have few friends and fewer like him. So, Cheers chocolate boy! Here’s hoping we end up going for more gigs and Bangalore trips together. Keep smiling and best of luck trying to fend off all those women throwing themselves at you. :P

<p>A true geek who plays brilliant guitar!? Damn!
Paanini is in all respects 'cool'. His attitude. The way he talks. Very calm and composed, again cool. And a brilliant guitar player, too cool!
One of the first few 'seniors' I interacted with on campus, he never really ragged me and was really friendly since my first day! :P  We've spent some amazing time together, playing music, cracking some mad jokes and laughing our assess off and taking people's case. Case reminds me he was the man who lied to me that CAS is a an easy subject, you don't need to study it and I got raped. Now rape reminds me about the insightful chat we had about 'delhi rapes', haha. 
Paanini is a true geek. He seems to know everything about Linux, and I still remember how like a salesman he told me about the way Linux works while he was installing it on my laptop, he loves it! A fellow Mikel Akerfeldt worshiper and 'Wake Up Sid' lover, he's been around to help whenever I've asked him for something. 
I don't think I'll ever play a song more bad-ass than 'The Drapery Falls' on stage in the college, that performance was killer and probably one of my most favourite ones!
So best of luck for everything man, you'll do really well and get back here in your second sem next year so that we can play some more Opeth and poke fun at people! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-kotwal">SIDDHARTH KOTWAL</a></p>
