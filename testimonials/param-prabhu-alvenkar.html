<h1 class="page-title">Param Prabhu Alvenkar</h1><p>One of the few I knew before coming to BITS. According to me atleast, he has changed a lot after coming to BITS. Here, he is 1 of d best gamers especially in aoe and dota. I cant keep a count on how many tv series he has watched here. Likes to enjoy his life to the fullest by doing the things he wants and taking d rest (eg. attending any classes) lite. He is also 1 of my neighbors and we have had a lot of fun here for the last 3 years. 1st year we used to play so many pranks on each other all the time for revenge of the previous 1 and they were like the major source of fun :D Ofcource they sometimes went out of control like the 'soap powder' incident, but that never stopped us from continuing to be great friends. I miss those old days. Also I remember sometimes we tried to study together the day before the exam (for d 1st time) trying to decide what all parts to just skip, and then instead of studying, end up talking about football and watching some video's of any movies or tv series or just football highlights etc. :P Great times, never to be forgotten.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
<p>Param is a fantastic guy . He is very well mannered, has an excellent sense of humour and has been a part of some legendary fun that we have had in our corridor. He's an excellent gamer too and completely down to earth. He has always been very helpful and you can always depend on him or anything you need. I wish you all the best for your future endeavours :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Param is one of the few people I knew(though not too well) before coming to BITS. I remember all the awesome times we had in the first year, playing AOE, the ‘Shiny Shoes’ Incident’, the soap powder incident(which was sorta my fault :p ), FIFA and all the other times in his and Pranav’s room we spent discussing random stuff. After the first year, he became a complete AOE/Dota machine, and the time we started spending together slowly decreased. Thats probably the reason we dont get as many QODs these days too! :D
I still dont know how he manages to study in such a short time and yet get better marks than the rest of us! All the best... I do hope one day you’ll become the ‘transport minister’! (you know why!)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>

<p>Known you only for a year, very soft spoken, calm and funny. It was really nice to have you in all my labs. 
Asking you for viva questions and finding out weird answers to them. :P  thank you for all the lab reports you did and I just had to copy. Even with your “ All games and no classes”   quality, you manage to get decent scores! Kudos :) Always a nice company… will look forward to work together again… good luck and warm wishes :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/poorwa-shekhar">POORWA SHEKHAR</a></p>
<p>Param.. what can i say about this guy.. he's a total gaming freak.. a high quality Dota / AOE machine player... one of the lightest people in this campus.. his expression when he says "Lite" is THE best expression i've seen...  he's a very humble down to earth who doesnt give a damn about anything other than his "gaming life" ... he is also famous for his short duration power studies which fetches him more marks than the most... Noone can match him in the domain of total number of tv series watched.. he is one Epic person !!! And he's alwaz a nice talk... thats when he is not gaming.. otherwise no matter what u say..its never going to get to his brain :P I know he is going to have one simple happy life in future.. best of luck dude... enjoy :)

<p>Prabhu Alvenkar Param A/S Pandurang (yes, I searched for it on swd :P) A/S El-Pensedor :D. The Epic One. Elp as he is called, is one heck of a guy to be with. A die-hard gamer, he plays/has played almost any game that can be played on LAN, AoE, DoTA, WoW, FIFA, etc etc. The most common phrase probably in the AoE chatroom is "Epic Elp is Epic" :D (credits: myself). He is the centre of attraction of one of the most watched AoE recos on campus (though for all the wrong reasons :P), one that will stay on dc for the coming years, and will never be forgotten by any of us who have witnessed it first hand. For someone who doesnt really give a fuck about acads, he does extremely well . The only occasions he goes to the b-dome are for his mech labs and for the exams. One of the very very few guys on campus who wont turn up for a surprise quiz even if he knows it well in advance. Asked why, his expression when he says "lite" is priceless. Its a shame that he is in mech and I am in cs, though I turn to him to set my comp right even for the most trivial reasons. A very good coder, he knows a lot about comps and mobiles and cameras ( you 4 goans + hc and your geeky talks used to drive me crazy in my first year :D). He is our NC once all other outlets of food on campus close. Thats the advantage of having a Goan friend. Can go to his room any time during the night, and he will have something or the other to eat. Your reactions, "lets see", "lite", "what do you expect me to do" and especially "arey wall me gap reh gaya yaar" ( :D :D :D :D just toooooooooo good man ), are some that I will never forget. Bitsian life without you would not have been the same man. Really hope that you get ur PS-II in Goa, and get alloted ch1 or ch2 (ghar mat bhaag jana :-/). Looking forward to another epic sem. Always keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-chandramouli">Varun Chandramouli</a></p>
