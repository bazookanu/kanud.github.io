title: Paris Mulye

<h1 class="page-title">Paris Mulye</h1><p>GOD! Is what everyone around here calls him. It's not just a lame nickname based on gaming or some weird incident, it is genuine because so is he. Paris' innate talent to learn about everything that fascinates his genius mind is a quality found in a few. His determination to do something that matters is also commendable. And most of all from MATLAB to Photoshop, his grasp over any and every software is awesome. He is one chilled out guy who'll take li8 and still rock every single exam. Because in his own words we should never give up because "chal na try karte hain....". You are a true inspiration.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Simply GOD. Any further words would be demeaning to the title.
Will remember him for his trademark "kya masti-giri hai yeh?" and his 'bindaas' light attitude. An instant favourite in any company he has this trait of making everyone like him at any place. This mechanical engineer I am sure is definitely going places. All the very best.

<p>GOD!! Dunno why he didnt keep that as his nick here. Everyone calls him GOD, and for good reason. This guy is pro in everything and everything he does. He is our very own Midas (reverse Midas would be more appropiriate), whatever he does, he becomes pro in that! A guy more interested in learning than getting marks (very rare in BITS).
I had some pretty awesome moments with this modest and hardworking guy. A pleasure spending 3 years with you, you will always be the one who made an athiest in me to believe in god :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>

<p>Well, where to begin from? He knows everything possible in the universe. He is a multitalented guy wholoves to crack an occasional joke. He loves to face new challenges and loves to keep his brain at work, always. He is modest , down to earth and has promised to keep his superpowers a secret (i think everybody knows about this now). He has been an awesome neighbour and friend for the past 3 years. Though he his pursuing his Engineering in the Mechanical field , he knows more about Electronics and Chemical stuff than the students in that discipline. Best of luck for the future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
<p>Just as was the case with most of the people of my hostel, I came to know Paris Mulye when I played TT with him in the common room. Ever since then we have been really good friends. Fondly called as the "God" of mechanical branch, he is very focused and dedicated to academics. He also has pretty good knowledge about Electronics and is quite interested in it as was seen from the way he and Akshay worked for a project. He is very humble, down to Earth and a loyal friend. My best wishes to you for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>Officially he is a Mechanical Engineer but actually speaking he is "all in one" engineer. So basically, he is GOD! Ask him anything and he has an answer. He has played a crutial role in my life in these three years. We have participated in events together and managed a couple of events together and i can tel you for sure, he is the one with whom u will love to work. He is a humble, down to earth person, with a never give up attitude! Im sure whtever he does in future he will definitely achieve success in it. I have sd it often, n il say it again, keep reading newspapers, one day u will find his name in one of dos papers! He has not only been a great neighbour but also a true friend for the last three years and i hope our friendship remains the same in future..All d best for ur future! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shrenik-khot">Shrenik Khot</a></p>
<p>Paris is a true genius. He is not someone who will be seen studying the whole time, he will only study just before the exams and yet has the rare ability to do tremendously well in them!!!! He is a person who always keeps his brain working, be it in the non-academic field or even in the kind of movies he watches. Even though he is so talented and intelligent (rightly called 'God'), he is very humble and soft-spoken, a quality that I believe is the most important in a human being!!!! He is a pro gamer (AOE) and an excellent badminton player. Those German classes we attended together were real fun and I am sure we will stay in touch for many years to come!!!! Chus for now.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>I've known Paris(GOD) since first sem.He is a very kind-hearted and principled person. He is one of the most brilliant people ive ever met and yet he is a very humble."Simple living, High Thinking" is something which describes him completely. He is a hardcore mechie who is also adept at computer programming and electronics(basically he knows it all).He is the one u go to when u hav any doubt in mechanical(or for that matter any other dicipline).We are mess buddies.During the past few years we hav been together in good times(road trips, PS-1) and bad(MEMS :P).Above all,he has been  extremely supportive(he always supports me in Man***ment vs engineering debate :P)and a very dear friend.May success be with u wherever u go. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sukrut-mhatre">SUKRUT MHATRE</a></p>
<p>Since now everyone knows that Paris is The God, I will not describe his godlyk characteristics again. I have to admit that he has been my inspiration and the one whom I look up to in BITS and was the pioneer behind me learning MATLAB and loads of other technical stuff (even though I am still an amateur in most of them). His willingness to learn and his single-minded focus will help him achieve great heights, I am sure. You have been a great friend and I look forward to spending 4-2 in your company. All the very best <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>GOD as he is aptly called, is not just a nickname. Paris excels at whatever he does, be it AOE, Acads or Sports. There is not one thing that he may have begun and left it without completing it. In-spite of having these awesome abilities he is very humble and down to earth.  Don't change. Stay Awesome! All the best for your life ahead.
PS. I know German better than you:p Auf Wiedersehen :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tanmay-binaykiya">Tanmay Binaykiya</a></p>
<p>Paris a.k.a. GAWWD is humble, cool and down to earth person. one of the brightest minds on campus , he keeps a low profile. i have known him since day1. we have played carom , T.T.(mentioned in my testimonial) to AOE2. he is a complete package with a good sense of humor.Extremely helpful in difficult times and innocent at heart, he is bound to get respect from others and as a result, his status has been uplifted from mortal to god of our campus. only thing i find weird abt him is rate of his eating(kiddin P) . with  your determination and sheer intelligence, you will achieve all ur success in life All the best !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurav-kumar">Saurav kumar</a></p>

<p>I take an oath before the old Gods and the new, that I would always believe in him,his power because I have seen him in my hostel,in my daily life behaving as a normal human being,but his secret couldn't be hidden forever. Paris(ENGLISH) and many people think of the beautiful Eiffer Tower,Louvre Museum and all the beautiful things that epitomise the wonderful place. And our very own Paris the GOD, truly is a beautiful person. I know Paris since past 5 years and trust me he has pleasantly shocked me every time. He keeps on doing newer and newer things.He learns softwares which are difficult to comprehend for a layman , in absolutely no time. The reason for this being he gives his heart to anything he does.He is an awesome adobe photoshopper, magnificent at MATLAB and well the space is just too less to list out what he knows. :) And the best thing about him is that he shares the knowledge with us and that makes his stand out as a person.Always helpful, he is an awesome gamer. You give him one hour or max 1 day for any new game and then he masters it. Now obviously when you are doing so many things ,theoreticallly your studies should get affected. But lo behold, he phodofies all of his subjects and for mere mortals on paper he is an 8 pointer. But I would rate him 100 on 10 for the amount of knowledge that he possesses. Paris,you have been a truly great friend to have. All the bestest for the future to us from you because God's wishes are always with us :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
<p>Paris, my group member in all my CDC labs…..his knowledge and grasp is inversely proportional to his size :P
I just love the way u speak… can’t describe but it’s very entertaining :D. He’s always there to ping after every paper and say “phod diya?”(lol)…he keeps speculating(or shld I say, firmly asserts ;)) if I am lying about my minimal preparations a night before the exam :P… <see, I am writing a you testimonial just before the CAD paper:P!!> n he himself tops many courses(only if he finds it challenging enough for him :P). I cant stop laughing when in the middle of a conversation he pops up and says “ok bye” :D :D
I really enjoy talking to you…have fun n keep your ‘lite’ attitude going… :)

<p>A really dedicated guy, great to work with, and really good at explaining stuff! Thanks a lot for everything you and sukrut taught in the ASME exploration... keep in touch! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/null">NULL</a></p>
<p>Paris (read in English) is a fricking dedicated and often too serious person. Though havent interacted with him greatly, our times in the MT2 labs are some of the more joyous and memorable moments I've had in any lab. From the times we had to control Sathe from breaking further instruments and causing damage to our reputation to helping each other in the Phy quizzes, the fun times were always ringing. This guy is a brilliant academic and hope something productive comes out of it in the years to come. Best of luck and please change the spelling of your name re, lest foreigners gawk at you. (You dont resemble Hilton in the slightest way you know). :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>Every time I need some help in acads, I run to this guy. Not only because he knows everything :P but because he'll never say 'no' to anyone. Its weird how he always has a 'take light' attitude and still manages to do so well. Was great to have him as a mechanical buddy for these 3 years. He's a great guy and a helpful friend. Nice to know we'll be together for one more sem after PS. Keep in touch! All the best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
