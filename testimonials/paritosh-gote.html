<h1 class="page-title">Paritosh Gote</h1><p>Now,Now, where do we begin? Mr. Paritosh Gote-excellent at acads, great person, loyal friend, incredible prankster. Every time I see him, he has a spark on his face (you cant place it, but its like some magician about to show a trick) Never a dull moment when you are with him. Paritosh is my partner-in-crime :D He always has a glint in his eye, an ace up his sleeve, and you can almost hear his mind working on some devilish plan.The things that go on in his mind, you couldnt even begin to guess.We have been in a couple of tight spots together, and he has always had my back. (I will never forget that water-pichkari-plant incident!) He is also a super smooth driver, an expert juggler, and can climb anything-walls ,trees,ropes, the lot. His way of thinking is straight, logical, methodical, and he rarely misses out anything, always knows the pros and cons. Watch him work out a problem, and you are amazed at the step-by-step planning and execution of even the tiniest details.(We call him The Strategist). He has amazing presence of mind. Yaaron ka yaar! A true and loyal friend! All the best for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Paritosh is one of my closest and best friends. He is a natural charmer and can talk his way into anything. An excellent swimmer, he has an extremely good physique and stamina. He likes doing all kinds of stunts and is very skilled at juggling. Exceptionally meticulous and logical, he likes things to be in order and proper steps followed for EVERY task at hand. Whenever I get overwhelmed by some workload, his methodical ways always help me out. My PS was so awesome all thanks to him! The times we spent there were some of the best and always bring back sweet memories. Even though I wonâ€™t admit it, he has been like a protective wall around me constantly guarding me from every problem. Extremely intelligent, yet so down-to-earth, he can achieve anything he sets his mind to. I am sure he will achieve great heights in any field he chooses. He has the just the right mix of innocence and maturity, making him the perfect guy! Always remain the same! All the best! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>I have know paritosh right from my school days and it has been one hell of a ride till now. Right from when I was six, our homes have not been more than 2 km apart . Paritosh disproves the saying 'empty mind is deveil's workshop' . His mind is always full of new ideas , but it is still a devil's workshop. He has come up with soo many pranks that it is now hard to keep count , most of the pranks being diverted towards rachit. He has always been my partner in crime , be it locking rachit's door, stealing his shoes , knocking on people's doors and running away( :D) . He is an expert in mastering any kind of skill ( 'aaicha skill' paritosh style) and has mastered some amazing skills including juggling . A long term dream of his is to be able to do a handstand. Dont worry, we still have one semester left. His stamina and fitness is remarkable . He can sprint 5 km in 15 min without even breaking a single molecule of sweat. Although he doesn't have a huge built ,with his upper arm strength , he can easily defeat a person twice his size at arm wrestling. Academics wise , he has some magic formula worked out, where every problem can be reduced into 'steps' . His approach to any problem is extremely logical and precise . Throw any problem at him , and he will eat away at it one step at a time. He is a very outgoing person who loves a new adventure and meeting new people. He has been one of my best friends right since the school days , and the sole reason why I am at BITS today and why I am doing Computer Science ( and not EEE) . No one in the group can drive a car as safely and efficiently like him .I guess the only time he got caught by the police while driving was when I was sitting right next to him (bad influence one might say) !!! Facebook stalking is a hobby passionately shared by all in the group but none has mastered it like paritosh. A friend request to every 'subject' that we encounter is his domain of expertise. All in all he is and will remain on of my best friends throughout . It has been a pleasure knowing you!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>
<p>With his mischievous face this guy pulls off innovative pranks and due to his innocent looks gets away with them.Study along with him during exams and you are guaranteed to do well.Has a childlike enthusiasm for the things he enjoys doing and still loves to pull childish pranks on people which are actually entertaining.An ace swimmer he loves adventure sports.Loves to climb trees,rocks and almost anything :P .Is very very methodical.Watching him decipher the logic and demolish a problem is really thrilling.A master of the Teakettle Principle :D.A very humble and modest person and always willing to participate in pranks it is awesome fun to hangout with him.A brilliant student who is a very quick learner and can apply theory to practical problems with ease I am sure he will be a great success in future.One word will forever be associated with him - "SKILL". :D .One of my first best friends(knew him from since mprakash) and will always remember a great friend,wish you all the very best for future.

<p>Paritosh! :D I have known this guy since we were in 7th (or 8th?), when we joined an IIT Pre-Foundation class. Since then, we have been hanging in the same social circles, but we really became friends after coming to BITS. I am really glad he decided to come to Goa (everything was open to him :P). The best way to describe him is "structured". I have never seen anyone  who is as systematic as Paritosh. The guy is able to break any problem into smaller ones, and then nip it in the bud. he also has the habit of taking photographs at awkward moments :D. Clever, talented, hard-working, dedicated as he is, Paritosh needs no luck to make it big. Keep in touch mate! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
