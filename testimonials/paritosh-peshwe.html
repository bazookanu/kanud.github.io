<p>Whoever is the president of institute may be..'PARI' is our president! He's a true leader..works really hard with Nirmaan (Hats off to u dude! |RESPECT|), a real music lover. This guy knows how to really 'enjoy' songs..will never forget his witty and extremely funny dances in corridors and washrooms! :P Funny though..he's undoubtedly the most popular M.E guy amongst B.E people! Enjoys his life to the fullest. A total Nagpurkar when it comes to nature.. if ur in any kinda problem.. Pari is the guy u'd wanna go to! He's got solution to almost every problem..although his problem of being 'single' hasn't been solved yet! :P
I won't ever forget the way u helped me in 'that special' matter of mine Pari...if anything good comes out of 'it'...all credit goes to u! :)
I have never seen u serious ever dude..really! Keep laughing and keep others charming with ur never ending happiness! Have a sexy life ahead..be blessed. Keep connecting ppl as Ishant said \m/
