<h1 class="page-title">Paritosh Ramanan</h1><p>The epitome of dedication ,hard work and sincerity.Has a knack to start an intellectual discussion anywhere and everywhere.A gifted coder and badminton player (awesome times those), a movie buff and a geek. Is absolutely obsessed with APSRTC (Hope u remember those "heated arguments"  :D ). Although he stabbed my heart when fell asleep when watching Death note(I will never forgive you for that... :D ). Proud to be your friend and will always cherish our time together. Wishing you a very happy and a successful life ahead. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>Easily one of the most dedicated, sincere and committed person I have ever seen. The fact that the number of classes missed by this maestro, all through his stay in the campus is hand-countable make my jaws drop (contemplating a possible higher % of oestrogen :D).. All of us will always be thankful to him for letting us know our limits of patience by his repeated denials for gracing us with his presence for trips, campus strolls and even NC (??) :D And the sense of achievement derived after successfully getting a nod from him and having him in our trips is something that only I know :D Of course, we had great times together, didn't we?? Paritosh has always been a great entertainer of the group at all times, thanks to his very short temperament. It needs very little effort to push him to excited state (as I'm probably doing now :P), sit back and watch the show, its really worth a try guys :D .. Jokes apart, he is an amazing, nice-to-be-with and very knowledgeable guy with lots of information to overload you with :P and engaged with sustained discussion for years. Had a great time with you here and even better in Delhi (remember..?? ;-) ). Thanks for being with me and making my campus life how enjoyable it was. Wish you a great career ahead! Hope to see you in some intelligence agency (R&AW or ISI :P) which goes well with your inherent love for SECRECY :D :D.. Farewell!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>what can I say? One does not simply meet a great guy like you everywhere :)
geeky, helpful and not to mention a lucid conversation starter. Paritosh never disappoints as far as conversations go. His views are radical, thorough and he sticks to them, no matter what. you are on my list of must have friends! All the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>
<p>Paritosh is one of the few people in campus who take their academics very seriously, which is highly commendable.  Intelligent, dedicated and sincere, he has achieved great heights during these few years in college, especially in Networks :) I guess we can agree that all the time spent with you, Aniket and Pavan, coding through the night, will be one of the most cherished moments in campus. Had great fun with you and I hope our paths cross again sometime soon in the future.
Best of luck and may you achieve even greater heights.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>It's really funny and admirable that you have put your nick as "pandu"."Phodu" would have suited you better. Leaving the fun stuff aside i think pandu ....opps.. :D paritosh has been a great friend.There is so much to learn from him that we cannot simply name all.Though his choices  of movies are not that good most of the time :P his choices of songs/places and food is \m/ .One of the best friend who has supported others throughout these BITS life and one simply cannot comment anything on his dedication to studies.More like "Monica" always wants work to be completed in time and no "masti" in work time.May you have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>

<p>Buddha! :D. Anyway,  Paritosh is a guy who when talks to you, you get the feeling that he is asking a doubt like in class. The way the guy laughs, speaks, behaves, his hand movements, it is just so unique. We have had almost all same classes and from past two years of attending or not attending classes I can easily conclude that he's a super sincere, dedicated student. And yeah intelligent too. Apart from these, the last IS farewell trip we had together hold some awesome memories which witnessed our famed fight. It's one of the highlights of IS batch this sem for me. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>

<p>I've known pandu ( paritosh just seems so formal :P) for over a year now and I'm glad I get to count him as such a close friend.  We've had some memorable discussions about all that is weird in our campus,delhi and beyond! . His witty comebacks (especially when he gets angry :D) and unique mannerisms always light up the room. Intelligent and extremely well read, he has a passion for technology that I really admire . One of the few people on campus who study to actually learn rather than just for marks, he's also very sincere and hardworking .  Though we may joke about certain opinions of his ,I'm sure his ironclad principles will take him very far.  All the best ! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayush-sanyal">Ayush Sanyal</a></p>

<p>He's one of the few guys I know on campus whose eyes light up at the words 'speedbrakes', 'missed approach', or 'go-around'. A complete airline freak, there have been countless hours spent discussing everything from Air Crash Investigation episodes, to the music played on flights :P. Sometimes discussions firing up even when we look up at an aircraft flying over the campus. I remember meeting him in first year among the 'BITS Hyderabad' batchmates, and has been my best friend ever since. A very sincere and dedicated person, a bit short-tempered (a fact we thoroughly enjoy, and is worth experencing :D). His dedication is evident from the fact that he sets his hourly study schedule for the full semester on his smartphone on the day of registration :P . But the one thing that really sets him apart from the rest of the gang is his dedication to attend classes inspite of how horrible they can be (like IntroSys) and also go ahead to top them. He can be found running to a 9am class even after waking up at 9.10!! And all those endless hours spent talking about 'Bangalore' (something to be cherished, we being non-resident Kannadigas) and about the highly respected KSRTC buses(yep...) have been awesome indeed. He's been my lab partner(along with Aniket and Alok) ever since our labs started, its been a wonderful experience spending those long nights churning through code... Well, do stay in touch, and all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pavan-agnihotri">Pavan Agnihotri</a></p>
<p>Paritosh, a person with loads of knowledge in the fields of computers and mobiles who never hesitates to share it with you. He is damn serious with acads and attends classes regularly which for sure takes a lot of courage. He takes full interest in whatever he does and sees to it that its done properly. Cheers to all the talks we had in Nescafe while bunking SE and all the debates we had (me, u and alok) in which mostly you emerged to be a winner :D... Have a great life ahead and wish you all the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Paritosh is a very humble person. He doesn't hesitate in helping others. He is very dedicated person, his hardworking nature has ensured him a good CGPA. He is a good negotiator and debater. He was my first classmate in bits. It's been fun to have you during our journeys from Home to campus and back. Yeah, I remember those doubt clearing sessions with Panda..:P. He is an academic phodu and he cleared the Microsoft internship written exam.. He has passion for technical stuff esp when it comes to android. The technical discussion between you and pawan and doubts regarding the "compiling" of codes are all the hilarious and cherishable moments. It's been good to know you and you will surely reach pinnacles in your field of interest. All the best for your future..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
