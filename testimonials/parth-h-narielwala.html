<p>Mr. Waves Convener is  one of the nicest person I have met here in this college. He has a genuine interest in sayari and can sometimes be overly enthusiastic in telling one of his latest. Completely down to earth guy and  a great friend. I wish you a great and successful future dude and hope you keep in touch.Yeah forgot to mention he worked in DEPP and was a writer for Dojma too!!!

<p>Nariel !!! It's weird but I have enjoyed fighting with him over trivial matters :P He is a natural when it comes to doing creative stuff and well we have to say an awesome leader. As one of the most dynamic and dhinchak Waves convenors he took the fest to an altogether new level. IIM-A is waiting on his doorstep :P Doesn't matter how much we argue, I am always gonna cherish those limited yet awesome times we've had together. You sir are an inspiration (well :P he's a lot of other things too) All the best and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Parth, Nari, Nariel and what not, this Waves 2011 Convener has never to my memory missed an opportunity to crack a PJ and believe me they are the saddest pj's you will ever listen. Jokes apart he is one of the nicest human beings I have met. If you have anything to share or something that has been troubling you he is the one you can go to,call at any point of time. He became one of my very close friends only in 2-2, but i am pretty sure he knows me better than most of my friends from the first year. As the waves Convener he has done the most awesome job. He is also one the most frank persons I know. Also he holds his values high and I am sure no matter what he wont compromise  with his values. Finally Mr. Parth Hemant Narielwala, i would like to say thank you for being a great friend and brother and may you achieve success in every part of your life. Jai Shri Krishna!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>

A person who is extremely good at heart and very understanding, Mr. Waves Convener has completely down to earth attitude and will be always ready to help you without an itch. This great entertainer.. :P (yeah right) and a very frolic person has an amazing comic timing too ! I still remember the great tale that you narrated had completely moved me that day. You have great values and I know you are going to scale heights with this kind of attitude !! All the very best for a bright future ahead !! :)

<p>Gujju, Nariel, his Pjs would make you to commit suicide and beat him a lot too. He is very proud of his pjs very shamelessly. He is very lively, His helping nature is charged with ever-ready batteries since he is always ready to help without any consideration for self. He is one of the rare most Bindaaass persons, i met in my life. Anytime u feel  hungry, the first person u would go to. I am very fortunate to have a friend like him. He is one of the most known persons on campus since he is the X-convener of Waves (:P). He doesnt have even a tinge of ego, very down to earth. And I know, a remarkable future is waiting for him. All the very best to our Gujjuuuuuuuuuuuu for his future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-sharma">Akash Sharma</a></p>
<p>Narielwalla, I have not seen a more lively person than you in my life. The best Convener ever seriously :).. If all the coming Waves Convenors work selflessly and think optimistically in each and every situation (u need it for waves,we know that :P) WAVES will surely reach new heights. 
Ur passion is so Contagious, i was the first to get infected by it and the rest of the COCO just followed. No matter how many hardships come, what anyone says always work for that dream and vision u have is one thing that i have learnt from you. But please save the World from ur PJ's Seriously :P. All those late night Meetings for Waves were memorable :). I seriously missed the narielwalla effect in the other meetings. In this journey , I dunno how but u became a very close frnd. Always be lively and ever Optimistic, U have miles to go :) . All the very Best for the very very Bright Future ahead. Stay in Touch. Send me a Pj every Month :P. Cheers to Our friendship and WAVES. May Both reach new heights :) :) . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshith-rao-yethapu">Akshith Rao Yethapu</a></p>
<p>Had great fun working with Parth - the waves convener :D A very intelligent and understanding person. One of the nicest guys i have met on campus!! I say it in spite of the fact that he always scares me from behind (BHAWWW....u kno!) $-/ .... and i always fall for it and get startled! Exhibits 'pure' passion and determination for anything what he does :P .... be it 'Pure' Milawat :P .... be it Studies :D A very entertaining banda. And most remarkably .... very Down to earth too. Feet on ground and eyes towards sky types guy :P Best of Luck Parth :) .... wish you great success :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
<p>Nariel! He's like shahrukh khan's movies at heart. Always full of drama, emotion and in the end leave you with a smile. I know the gujjuman since first year because of my beloved DoJMA. I've worked with him, seen him working. And after all those years I can conclude one thing for sure, he's the man for getting anything done from the pragati waale bhaiya. Apart from that, he's always and i mean always the guy you give work to or ask him to do anything and he'll just get it done anyhow. He's this amazing convincing power to which people just never say no to. Convener sahab, it's a pleasure being in your waves 2011 team. May you have the same enthusiasm forever! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>

<p>Waves. That's where it began. That's where it ended. And the journey was intense, amazing, and mind-numbingly awesome. The only person who I can say has been equally, or rather more passionate about Waves than myself. And without doubt the only person who could have pulled off a festival like THAT. No exceptions. An amazing friend, an awesome person, and a perpetual PJ-machine. You've been one of my best and closest friends, though a lot has changed now. For what it's worth, I'd take this opportunity to apologize for recent behaviour and to let you know that though Waves 2011 is over, my room still misses your presence at times. Wishing you all the very best in all your future endeavours. I know you've got success written all over your destiny. Stay the same and don't lose that admirable attitude and dedication. And keep bringing happiness everywhere you go, like you always do! Here's to all the sleepless nights and endless fights (POEM! Wah wah! :P) And to Waves 2011. And more than anything else, to the amazing friend that you've been. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>

<p>Ok, first of all Waves 'twenty eleven' was fuck all shit and bore, toh usko toh lite hi le le. Baaki after-waves party at Coconut creak was \m/. I really don't know how we met or why did you even try to come to 'The Corridor', but you did and you paid for it :). The guy from library turned into the guy from footpath (yeah that's our hangout place :|), but still you used to score well, biaaatch!!! He is fun, emotional (even when all senti-ness is not required), tekda, serious, enthusiastic (over :D) but more than everything a great friend. All those over late-night-snacks talks were intense and all, but ye bata itni problems aati kaha se hain? Hame to nahi aati. And, never go with him anywhere in Mumbai, dick made me miss my 11.40 ki last local, but that was good, I got to eat gujju food at his home :) Baaki CP k itution fee to money-order kara dio. Our all trips have always been full of adventure, be it palolem, chapora, Curlies' night out but I think gokarna trip was awesom-est and the best (so far). My new padosi ( life is not always fair, but one has to live with it :( ) He has framed out all his future, planned everything well in advance and he'll surely get them. Toh all the best for that toh hain hi, baaki stay in touch and have a great life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sagar-birla">Sagar birla</a></p>
<p>9 AM on a Sunday morning. Everyone is ready to go the mess except for this guy. A knock on the gate, followed by much louder subsequent knocks and profanities. A person with a really weak voice mumbles something from inside. Nobody could make the heads or tails of it but everyone has a smile on their face because of the ‘weird noise’ they just heard. As we try to wake him up, their is some sort of commotion inside. After a few moments, Nariel comes out of his room looking exhausted. To this date, you haven’t told us anything about your ‘special Sunday morning routine’ :D Nariel is one of those guys you would always want by your side. Because no matter what, he will always come through for you. Extremely dedicated and a sincere fellow. Whether it is his academics (you scored more after becoming a part of ‘the corridor’ which is really shocking :P) or his first love “WAVES” (recent events have not been taken into consideration here, so li8). BTW in Waves 2011, apart from the nites, everything else was li8 :P :D (saste jokes ka theka sirf tune nahin liya hai tegde). Great at producing sketches. That is one thing I hope you continue to do for a long long time. This guy is completely down to earth and has no ego issues whatsoever. He is always excited about something but has certain calmness on his face. Except for the times ‘jab teri hath jaati hai kisi baat par’. Nariel, I am glad that you became a part of the ‘the corridor’ and became an indispensible part our lives. Every outing, whether it was the nite out at Curlies or Gokarna, was simply mind blowing (P.S. Gokarna was by far the best P:)) Baaki next sem phodu placement ke baad bhi apna main passion mat chhodna (gaadi saaf karna :P).You have everything planned out for you like a picture perfect post card and I am sure the execution would be just as sweet as the planning. Cheers to our friendship and to you for being the person you are. :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-tak">Varun Tak</a></p>
