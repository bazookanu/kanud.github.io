<h1 class="page-title">Parth Pooniwala</h1><p>calm, composed, lazy, smart, intelligent, more lazy, polite, sensible and even more lazy... Well, you won't find many like him. A good person at heart and ready to support u in times of need. He is a very dear friend and you would feel lucky to have him as a friend. 

Have a great life ahead mate, there is no doubt whatsoever. Whatever you wish, you will get it at the end of the day.. All the best and god bless :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>One of my best friends in the campus and surely  one of the few non-nerdy geeks i know.  Better known as the guy whos got most of our pics of AH5 group and all its tours and travels :D, hes well known among the whole hostel .

Its been a pleasure studying with him . He also the only biker whose riding skills i completely trust ( next only to myself) , and also a great trip organiser. He is also the gy who remembers every one of our friends's birthdays and organises them without fail :)

For all you have done! Keep it up man!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>
<p>Parth- 'the only sane person' is a perfect blend of smartness, intelligence yet humble, down to earth. He is a friend who will be there by your side always. Never attending classes, still a phodu proves his talent. Tv series, manga, 9gag, football, coding defines him. I thank rachit to introduce me to him and parth to be my friend. Wish u all the very best for ur future Mr. Sane :P :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>A great coder, definitely !!! You've been my neighbor since 3 years and still we've talked much. You're amazing sportsperson and manage extra-curricular with studies pretty well. I'll remember you for your helpful attitude towards everyone.
Best of luck for your future endeavors and wish you success in life !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Well truth be told , I am surprised nobody has mentioned DoPY yet ,but I guess since I was the one to coin that name for you,its more than fair that I get the privilege to do it.Wants to try and do everything, a cesspool of ideas,the biggest fan of 9gag and memes that I have come across. Irritating chudaaps, mast jugaads, superb coding skills and humility are some of the feathers in his cap. A natural talent for almost everything he does and a really hard worker are sure to take him far in whatever endeavors that he takes up in his future.All the very best for your future.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritesh-ranjan">Ritesh Ranjan</a></p>
<p>Its very difficult to write a testimonial for  person like Parth  because you would have to use all the  adjectives of the English language and yet find that it would not be a complete description of him.But still ,I will give it a try.One of the most multi-talented guys I have seen. He is good at whatever thing he takes up.A gifted coder,amazing football player and the god of computers.An extremely quick learner(One of the most brainy fellows I have come across) .I have always been awestruck at his mature and logical  opinions in those never-ending conversations I have had with him(Although, of late those conversations have been filled with posts from 9gag). Un-paralleled enthusiasm and zest for life.An extremely loyal friend and a very good manager (Be it birthdays,trips or treats!).  Proud to have you as my friend and will always cherish the beautiful memories in this campus.I wish you a very happy and a successful life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>A perfect example of whom we call "multi-talented" ..a great sportsperson, a coder, a writer and a brilliant mind..a calm mind, an understanding nature and a pure dedication towards whatever needs to be done has gained him the respect of everyone around...starting out as the hostel dopy..to organizing trips,playing for the hostel etc etc.. he gets actively involved in everything that happens here...the person who everyone looks up to, you are a great guy to have for a friend and i wish you all the best for everything in the future..i am sure its gonna be awesome for you.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-deshpande">Aditya Deshpande</a></p>
<p>Pooniwala... This is to thank you for the CN assignment code and the numerous other assignments you have helped me with so that I can passout from this so called institute and call myself a CS engineer. I dont need to recount all your abilities..but it would be hard not to say you are the complete allrounder (in our corridor to say the least). A good coder and a superb footballer aside you have been a great friend. A true BITSian to the core.

P.S Kal consys hain..kuch seekha de be <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>Parth, Portho, Porthos, sine_cera etc etc etc. He is probably the only guy in campus with more names than the languages that exist! His spirit of living is an example for everyone to follow. Even if he's annoyed at you, he's gonna help you every way out. A superb coder, athlete, and tech savvy. Offlate he seems to be too obsessed with 9gag. Dude, you've been really wonderful throughout these 3 years. Hope you have hell lot of opporunities and accolades into your name. God Bless you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>Patience is an attribute that very few people genuinely carry and this CS dude shows us exactly how to do it . He always brings in the much needed maturity around the hostel . You can literally call him the backbone of the hostel , with his full hearted contribution towards any hostel event. He is easily attracted towards enjoyment ,be it of any form . He is the best defender that the ah5 football team had with amazing sliding tackle :P ! ,,, Big fan of soft rock and even bigger fan of movies/tvshows .Coding toh iske blood mein hai hi ,aur ek din android ka sabse ultimate App banake dikhaega. Life gets much easier when you have a friend like him . cheers :) ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-das">Varun Das</a></p>
<p>Pro coder & sportsperson. Has this unique ability to not be the Liabrary Keeda & still end up with good grades. Loves to watch movies , tv series , anime. Spends infinite time on 9gag. Lives the life to the fullest , regrets nothing. But the best & rare quality he has is to be there for everyone in their hour of need, truely a friend you can count on. One of the best friends i have had & hope it stays that way for long time. P.S. tarif bahut ki ab nc chale ? <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-palasgaonkar">Vishal Palasgaonkar</a></p>
<p>The Android Partner 2 =) Well we've not known each other long but it's been real pleasure knowing him. OS and Android Guru, 9 Gag Lover and a Pro Debugger. Can't thank you enough for all the help during the Project. Aap na hote toh Custom List View ka kya hota. Ambitious, Dedicated, Determined and on his path to Glory ! Wishing him all successes in life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>The best way to describe him would be a intelligent, calm, composed, helpful person with awesome coding abilities  He loves playing football, watches loads of movies, is a big Manga and 9gag fan. Although an introvert to some extent he is one of the most popular people around thanks to his simple and friendly nature. He is what I regard as the true 'Phodu' who makes exams look a very easy affair. He is the master of getting maximum output through minimum input although it is scary to sit next to him in a TIME class as he comes up with an answer even before you are started with the question. He is the informal dopy of our hostel and has covered almost every event of the hostel over these 3 years. He remembers all the birthdays unfailingly and makes sure that our birthdays don't go without a cake, something which not many don't acknowledge. He is ever ready when it comes to bike-rides we have had many awesome roadtrips together. A great guy to be with and a friend you can be always be proud of... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>

<p>Parth Pro Pooniwaala ………. That’s what I love to call him :P …….. I met him initially in A mess where he was impressed by my information about his hometown Burhanpur. He is seriously a <strong> PRO </strong> coder (OS online topper). He is the Android guru of our hostel and knows a hell lot of other programming stuff too. A very sharp mind along with his cool and composed demeanour makes him stand apart. He is the DoPY of our hostel, always ready with camera on everybody’s birthday. Placements phod dena Parth …………:D Wish you all the best for your future and do keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>I vaguely recall having interacted with Parth in the first semester of my BITS tenure. It had something to do with aiding me in coping with my academic losses due to hepatitis. I don't exactly remember what the agenda of that meeting was, but its spirit is what defines my acquaintance with him. He has helped in so many ways! From editing the god-awful shots I gave for the hostel video, to Atlasing the burden of my Computer Networks assignments; Parth has been so much of a blessing to me! He excels at programming, photography, soccer, and god-knows what not. With that, he closely follows internet memes, and is a fellow rage-comics fan. He was someone to discuss memes with, and boy were those discussions enjoyable! We are to go our separate paths now, Parth. I will miss you. Do take care, and know that you are gifted in talent. May you also be gifted with a fulfilling life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tuhin-sah">Tuhin Sah</a></p>
<p>Parth, CS phodu!! A very energetic, talented, always curious for programming, a gud sportsman, fun loving, ”chudaap ka baap”...( li8 the list wont end.. :P) He is one such person who remembers everyone’s b’day n does all arrangements... (n ever-ready to kick my *** even if its not my bday!!). He is very humble, kind and always there to back u (be it be studies or getting a girl.. :P) as far as i kno... never sit on the bike if he is driving.. :P If u have to find him, never go to his room..(he will never be there :P), just come down to ground floor, he must be “Trolling” somewhere around Bellu’s room :P. Had 9gag applied taxes on their use, Parth wud have been the hightest tax payer!! If u want to phodofy some exam, without much efforts.. he is the guy whom u shud follow!! :D. Apart from football he is gud at cricket as well.. (believe me, u are much better cricketer than footballer.. ;)) 

Even after 3 years, i can still see the same spirit n enthusiasm in him. He is strongly passionate about the things he does , be it, winning an android phone by an overnight coding or playing football for whole day!! I m really gonna miss all the bakwaas, godlevel sastas n thousands of crackles we shared (especially the ones in Bellu’s room :D :D). Cheers bro!! All the best for all ur bright future.. definitely milte rahenge agar tune pakana chhod diya toh.. :P ;) had all the awesomest time together \m/

PS: ab isse jyada taareef nahi hoti... bday tr8 kab de raha hai?? :P

<p>Parth has been a great friend since the past three years... i feel lucky to be his friend since the first sem... plays exceptional football, is an awesome coder (always gets the output :P)... And dude.. Android Pro toh aap hain.... had Parth not been there, I would have given up on Android... your all night help before assignments, 2 weeks of continuous coding for the project was truly amazing... i really thank you for that!!! Really enjoyed studying with you in 3-1 and this sem compre preparation we did together though we didn't have the same subjects was too much fun... the electric current experiments with you and prathamesh was amazing... I hope you carry it forward in the next sem on other people :P .... The afternoon nesci visits during compre in severe heat will also be missed :P... I hope the best for your bright future and may our friendship last long! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>I came to know of Parth only in my 3-2 and as I interacted more with him, I regret not meeting him before. We share core common interests. He is a really passionate coder . Topping OS online proves that more than anything else. We have spent many evenings with our 3-member DSTN group and the time we had while exploring and coding was fun! He is also a huge meme fan. Apparently  he also plays great soccer. From what I've seen him , he is always cool , calm and composed . Lazy too ,not afraid to admit it though, as he once did to Biju Sir and Biju Sir congratulated him for maintaining consistency in remaining absent :P Don't change and keep the passion alive ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>
<p>Professionalism!!! This guy has it... He can even start off his classes with this. I actually learned the way a multiprocessor works... Parth showed me through his lifestyle.  So much of talent filled in his blood. This guy can really get better at about anything in just no time. I must say that his learning curve is a straight vertical line (with the amount learned on the X-axis  ...  :P :D). Pro-footballer, Pro-coder, Pro-photographer,Android-Pro... endless list. One does not simply possess so much talent.. but you do. Manages all our hostel events, takes interest in leading activities, not shy to try anything new, simple nature, never boasting.. always trying to be gay (happy.. I mean... :P) , he is a very open person. A person carrying the largest database of movies, actors and actresses (ob... ;), this guy can watch and review a movie in an open laptop exam... :). He is definitely one of the most proficient persons around the campus... and a friend to be proud of... I hope that you make the most out of your talent...  Best of luck for your future life. Be in touch, :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyesh-shrivastava">Priyesh Shrivastava</a></p>

<p>As i finally find time to write a testimonial for you (:P)............i simply dont know where to begin from.............I dont know remember how, when and where we met............my best guess is that we met through a group of mutual friends............but even then, my interactions with you in the first year i guess have been far and few...........but now when i look back, ifeel truly blessed to have a friend like you............one of the most selfless creatures that i have ever met in my life.............an extremely tall and lanky person who carries himself in such a way that is worthy of praise...........one of the most popular guys around because of his helpful and sweet nature..........you can never have a dull time if you are with parth............he has a great sense of humour and is a keen and avid listener because of which whenever i have any interesting anecdotes to tell, i make sure i tell it to this guy first..................he has that sort of eidetic memory when it comes to remembering all his friends birthdays and he always is at the forefront when arranging for their birthday cakes...............he is more active than even any Dopy member when it comes to taking snaps on various occasions..........has a great deal of knowledge about almost all the things under the sun, be it tv series, movies,sports , studies or any damn thing................he is also an awesome football player and believe me you wouldn’t want to come in his path when he is running away with the  ball :D...........the sort of person who manages his time so well that he simply finds ample  time for studies as well...........a pro coder and well and truly suited to his branch...........9gag and android have been the most important things in his life, i guess, in the past few months............some of the best times that i have had are with u in bellu’s room and i hope we have a blast next sem as well.............all the best for your future............there is simply no doubting your talent and you are indeed going to go a long way in life ..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-verenkar">Akshay Verenkar</a></p>
