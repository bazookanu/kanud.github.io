<h1 class="page-title">Parth Sudhir Joshi</h1><p>"Down to earth, yet above the rest"- The complete description of Parth Joshi! A hard core mechanical engineer, his modesty and dedication set him apart from the rest. Any Mechanics problem, Parth just twirls his pen, and step by step, neatly, the problem is solved-its almost like watching one of those software tutorials!!-- He firmly stands for what he believes in , and will never hesitate to set you right if you start going astray. When it comes to humour, Parth has a totally different angle- only a couple of words are more than enough. I am proud to have a friend like Parth.-- All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>One of the coolest guys in Mech with sky-rocketing CG and marks :P His sincerity and humility are qualities worth noting. I wish him all the best for his future. 
Enjoy :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>

<p>Parth..if I think about him, my first reaction is always- How can someone be that hardworking, intelligent but yet so simple with such a big heart. But yes this is Parth Joshi, always smiling. I am thankful to PS1 for introducing him to be me. Mechanical Engineering is blessed to have him. I wish him all the best  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Parth has always been a great friend! He is a talented artist, a classical tabla player-his hands tap the tabla so fast and so sharply, you can distinguish each beat, yet his hands are just blurred!! He just worships Indian classical music. I have seen him work at SPICMACAY, and have never seen such a modest spicmacay member. In PS1, i remember Parth giving an entire 3 person presentation all by himself, and then tearing the instructors questions to shreds. Anything Parth does, he is sure to have deep knowledge about it- be it Indian culture, or the LHC. Parth is surely going to be a great person in the field of Mechanical Engineer!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Parth is one of the few people I know who have figured out what to do with their life. Parth and Mechanical Engineering mix like water and ethanol( which he will never touch :P) . His sincerity ,  dedication and passion is what sets him apart from the rest. His morality ( though adversely affects his chances of winning in 'mafia' :P ) is what makes him highly respected among his peers. His one line dialogues can leave even a person like mrinmay in search of a response. His mastery over marathi is unparalleled . Besides, he is also an excellent tabla player and a connoisseur of Indian classical music. His humbleness in spite of his versatility is what makes him so likable. Academics wise, he is sure to excel , having topped the mechanical CDCs . It has been an honor to know you and I wish you all the best for your future!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>

<p>I've known Parth since the DG Foundation days.I was always amazed by his clear thinking abilities and strict methodical approach to tackling all problems. There is not a soul in this campus that can touch him when it comes to mechanics(Kulkarni Sir _/\_). He is a pure Mechanical engineer! The way in which he destroyed the CDC's is truly remarkable. He loves Indian classical music,has great knowledge about Marathi songs/movies/plays/everything!. Parth is a very traditional guy.He prays everday and is a true believer in the higher power. He has a very simple lifestyle. But don't be fooled by his simplistic ways, behind his childlike smile,is a total genius. He can take you down in any argument with a single shot. I will always remember the way he gave headshots to Aditya and Mrinmay while arguing in A mess. Parth is honest and hardworking,never seen him miss a single class!(there was a case when 2 teachers were teaching with only Parth in the class!!).He will never hesitate to help those in need,he will even sacrifice his own studies to make sure you understand everything clearly. You can't find many people like him in today's world.
Never change the way you are,Parth! Hope(I know) you will have a successful life ahead.All the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>There are people who talk and there are people who just need not. Rather their actions proclaim far ahead of them. Parth is definitely a member of the latter community. He is simply the simplest guy in our mechanical engineering department that I have seen (not joking). High thinking, Simple living was probably written for him. I recall when I first interacted with him during our TRW presentation, he impressed me tremendously with his attitude and soft-spokenness. He is remarkably good at all mechanical engineering softwares most notably PRO-E. He is a pleasure to talk to at all times and his advice is always sound and very helpful. His child-like enthusiasm and that innocent baby smile on his face make him an instant favourite company with everyone. An ideal student being very regular for all classes, destroying all examinations has become quite a hobby for this one awesome mechanical engineer. His diminutive sized head houses one of the most intelligent minds and he has really conceptually understood and learnt everything unlike me and a lot of other people. All these are I am sure going to make him a great Mechanical Engineer one day and he will make us all proud. I just hope that he retains his innocent smile forever and may we stay in touch for the rest of our lives as friends. ALL THE BEST!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Many people of our batch owe their grades to Parth /\. If not for him we would all be wondering what the fudge was going on. An incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable guy, Initially I was stunned by Parth’s straightforwardness, but in the past year I have come to respect it immensely and also witnessed his sharp humour. I will always treasure our conversations on mech, companies and academics. Unlike the other people in BPGC, Parth’s tastes are very refined and mature. He reads poems and books on philosophy and humour by great Marathi authors. Many people have already said this and I will say it again: Parth is the best Mechanical Engineer of our batch, he can effortlessly solve a problem and retrieve the most obscure information from any point of his engineering education without breaking a sweat. A feat NO student from bpgc can even claim of doing… He is an unstoppable force and will achieve anything he sets his mind to. I wish him the best of luck and great success in his future endeavors :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shashank-acharya">Shashank Acharya</a></p>
<p>Parth Joshi!!The best lab partner one could ask for.  I have known him since MT2 lab and since them I have been happily copying all his reports.I still remember once I didn't ask for his report and he thought the lab was cancelled..one of the most academically dedicated person I have come across in BITS with a genuine interest and skill in Mechanical Engineering. His love for tabla and classical music(Spicmacy) is also commendable.
All the best...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-mehrotra">PRANAV MEHROTRA</a></p>
<p>Parth is one of the most hardworking guy i have seen on campus. His dedication to complete and ace in even the most mundane activities like lab reports is truly remarkable (without which our lab group would have had a lot of issues :P). His perseverance and determination to complete the task at hand is unique and i got the full blast of it at SKF where we had our PS1. I remember when in those rare occasions when we dint have any work, gaurav and i used to chill out, while this guy would diligently go down to the MVR machine and take readings of the defective bearings that came its way. An awesome tabla player, he is also a very humble person. He and modak taught me the little marathi i know during PS1...Hope you succeed in all your endeavours in life and all the very best for your future... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>Parth. The most genuine persons I could ever see. I mean he goes without chappals to the bathroom, worships his God idols every day, speaks to his mom daily for at least an hour, his mobile text is in Devanagari !! He is the ideal Indian boy that every Mom and Dad wish their son to be. My first encounter was in 9th Standard. Math tuitions. Parth was a struggler, he never got his equations and geometrical relations right. And after a flash, I see him in BITS on the very first day. Woah !! This guy had become a genius by then. It speaks about his capacity to push himself. Of course, his grades in Mech. Engg are ample testimony to that. but only a few of us have seen the hard work that goes into it, and I applaud you for that. Parth is one of those who takes me back to Pune. To my roots, to my cultures. He makes me realise what I am, and what I should be. The highlight being the hour long chats we have next to the AH3 staircase open windows. Parth is the only person I know, who has roots, as well as wings. He is going to fly high in life on his wings of achievement and excellence, yet remain true to his roots, entrenched deep in the soil of humanity and human values. I bow down to you, for being able to be who you are, irrespective of what others think and do. For being able to follow your heart, take your own decisions without having to follow the mob. *Bows down*. 
Keep in touch, with me and your inner values and thoughts. Keep them the way they are, and I am sure you will generate a 1000 more people who will respect you for what you are and follow you for what you do !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mrinmay-milind-kulkarni">Mrinmay Milind Kulkarni</a></p>
