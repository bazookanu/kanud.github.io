<h1 class="page-title">Pavan Agnihotri</h1><p>Someone once said "the farther a friend, the closer he is".. Well, let me tell you, I was very fortunate  to find an exception to this theory in the form of Pavan, close to heart and just a few rooms away. That's as close as one could ever get. I still remember the day I met this guy when he reported on campus (5th iteration), excited to see someone of the same regional background. It has been a long and a truly enjoyable journey since then. More than a truthful, loyal, dedicated and helpful friend that he is, I will ever remember Pavan as a GOD of computers and a savior at times of computer related crises (a recent one he was very instrumental in solving and getting me out of the fix), yet a simple and modest man. Its a different feeling altogether to have a GOD always willing to help, at such proximity, one better felt than told. His techniques of problem solving, technical inclination, interest and extreme dedication towards his duties is truly adorable. It was a pleasure to be in touch with him and cherish all those conversations we had. Thanks for being with me though the times, good, bad and hard. I see an illustrious career ahead of you.. Farewell, Wish you all luck :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>

<p>The only person on campus who understands, if not outdoes my knowledge of Aircrafts, Weapon Systems, Warfare and Trains alike. One does not simply mess with Pavan on his knowledge of trains and history alike. It was indeed a wonderful experience to discuss these topics of our common interest at 3 in night when we had exam at 8:30 :D. FTW! 
Apart from all this he is one tech god you can always look up to when you are stuck with something! And not to mention his ultra-clean room, my room wasn't that clean even when it would have been built brand new! What order he maintains in keeping his room tidy! Hats-off! :D
It was great to have you on my side during my journey here at BITS! All the very best man for all of your future endeavours! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>
<p>I remember meeting Pavan in a weird way. I guess Paritosh had suspicion that he was kannadiga(Very rare species). So me and Suresh started talking loudly in Kannada in front of him (I guess we used to call it the kannada test). And he slowly turned his head around and very mildly asked "Kannada?" And then began our beautiful friendship.He is a God when it comes to computers. In Srikanth's words: He knows the pulse of his machine and he can feel it.A very soft spoken guy and a very friendly nature. Greets me with a playful jab(which almost kills me). Extremely passionate foodie and gorges on Pizzas.
 Those memorable conversations and amazing trips which we have been a part of will always be etched in my memory.Proud of being your friend and I wish you all the best in your future endeavours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>

<p>A PC surgeon by profession and a simple person by nature. I can remember the long talks that we had standing in the corridor. A person with a very clean room. He is always unhappy about the BITS system so we share a common disliking.Because of his PC healing skills entire corridor pays regular visits to him starting from swapnil to kawley. A pro coder as well. We always talk about google's new products and appreciate google's vision. He is always updated about the latest technology and loves to talk about it. I got a lot of knowledge from him regarding Computers and internet and many more... thanks for that. and all the best. Keep healing...:)

<p>Pavan is a very simple, calm, down to earth, intelligent, polite person.The most “geek”iest person I’ve seen on the campus….aaawww…he know everything abt troubleshooting.
We used to share kannada songs and telugu movies.
He was my Bangalore “guide” during PS….it was he who suggested me to visit many places in blore…..i would have never enjoyed my PS so much without his guidance. 
I’ll miss those long hours of bitching about teachers (:P).
Best of luck. Stay in touch. :)

<p>The best 'IT guy' in campus. If anyone had any troubleshooting done, he was a natural choice for help. Technically sound and passionate, Pavan's knowledge in the field is unique. Navigating through fatal errors is child's play for him. I guess few of the most memorable moments would be the time spent in Pandu's room coding away for one project or the other. The Android project that we did together would definitely be one of the best times we spent together. I guess I'll never forget the countless hours we spent trying to figure out how to get the ListView to behave the way we wanted to or other similar Android troubleshooting.  Great times :)
I hope you have a great future, and may you keep coding. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
