<h1 class="page-title">PAWAN KUMAR</h1><p>hello pawanaaaa....., inki smile par mat jana....jitna shatir dimaag ye aadmi ka hai utna shayad hi kisi ka hoga.  In truest sense the most mischievous person I have ever seen and supposedly will ever see. Batein banana to koi inse sikhe. Jokes apart, you are an incredible person. Helping, kind, loving for some..:) and very friendly to all of us. Our days spent together and all ur stories and ur "Kaptaan guide karo yaar"....are going to be the bedtime stories for my children....:)....Really,...all ur funny pranks and whatever u say and u do go back home wid me and every1 back there know u well enough. 
You are a  hard working person IF u start working.. You have always been mind relaxing .
Sahi baat batau, Like when a person comes back home from office he thinks he will go and relax. similarly when I come from classes I think chalo Pawan ke room thoda relax ho liya jae...... U are the one who gave me this bihari tone that people say "Wo hai to sardar par bolta Bihari hai"................... You will become a very gud manager and leader and please don't join govt service... ek aur aalsi sone waala aadmi add ho jaega......
Hope u get wat u wish for....................Will always be ur frnd.........naye dosto ke beech .don't forget me.............tc........

And last but not the least ....."IS PHOTO MEIN KYA LAG RAHA HAI YAAR"...../\/\/\/\/\/\<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>

<p>The tall good-looking guy of campus :P Knew 1st through DC... and his unbounding love declaration for 'ahem ahem' :P ... But actually knew him better by Janmashtami work. I am very glad I didn't kill you for concentrating more on Gopikas than kanhaji :P Anyhow... it was great fun to work with you. A very entertaining personality and awesome convincing skills. A very helpful and kind hearted person :) Wish you great success in everything!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
