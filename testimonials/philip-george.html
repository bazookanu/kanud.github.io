<p>Philips...his motive in life is to find out the CEO of Philips and marry his daughter so that he becomes the owner and doesn't have to change the company's name :P Philip is one of my very good friends iv found in BITS....known for his simplicity and his consistent grades! One of the genius minds in the campus....a very nice person to talk to....hard-worker! His malayalam lessons have been truly helpful for me in times of utmost need ;) He gets reely annoyed by the hovering fighter aircrafts and IC engine bots...  #$%^&  (btw....if you can decode that....you will know his catch word :P ) Its awesome to have u as a friend for company....a very good coder....U'v got a great career ahead man! Wish u luck for all your future ventures.... :) cheers :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sahu">Siddharth Sahu</a></p>
<p>I still remember our first day in campus when we met at borkar and this legendary friendship starts. One of my first few friends in BITS... Then fortunately your hostel also got changed and u became the proud member of CH1. (I still remember how much u were pissed off that day becuase of hostel assistant.)  My guru of Malayalam.........:)
We have lots of memorable moments together which I cannot share here but will always remain close to my heart. Very nice person by nature and always ready to help. We always used to do assignment only on the day of submission and every time some how manage to finish it before deadline. I am very lucky to have you as a friend.
Hope you have a bright future ahead..........:)
ALL THE BEST.........!!
