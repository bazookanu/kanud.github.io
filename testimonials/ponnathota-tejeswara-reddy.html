<h1 class="page-title">Ponnathota Tejeswara Reddy</h1><p>
Jeja, Teja Bhai, PITIR, Tiger Man, Chick magnet :D, andari vaadu, LATHIKA, Opteshwar Reddy :D.......etc. and there is just no end for all the names we used to call u with. A bindaas fellow always and anytime available to kill time and a wonderful company, pretty idealistic when it comes to antisocial(:P) activities like cheating in exam, breaking in into the que(which was quiet annoying at times :D) etc. Kind of a man who only does things which he finds interesting and my Bournville partner(FYI, sharing only the interest but NEVER even a single bournville). A non CS type who kind of became induced and became partially CS in 3rd year and a great friend.

I think it was 4m 2-1 that we actually got closer, to be frank i dont e1 remember how and when we met 1st on campus. But starting 4m 2nd year, me u n rahul continuous 24/7 hanging out, every day eve ice and spice all the evening walks, i can say that we have spent a loottt time together in BITS life, the unending stories we made on u, the parallel universe versions, RAKTHA CHARITRA, ur light, the power of ur thoda :D "idar maareto nandyal me resound aatha :D" ur thoda tapping instead of enter, and "chituka veeste power raavadam" all ur girlfriend stories, and hey, ur computer lab jaan jigiri ur fight for the PC with one of the "babes" on campus and  really really sorry man, we did not make our comic on u :P i assure u, it will be done. I am sure u remember the 1st episode of it which we told, it wont be changed, wait and see :P It was a pity u for falling in khasi CS batch, tough u also got lil khasi in 3rd year, so no more pity.  I really dint understand y never broke into the que in the mess, instead waited all the way in the loong line. U were the default company to come to shop co :D if no company there is teja :D ! Always used to drag u there.....and hey "BANANA" all the ideas of crazy tech for that company u r abt to establish, overthrowing Intel with Liquid processor, mass and energy transfer tech, teleportation and all the instant crazy ideas :D I will never 4get the hand u gave me and i had to give treat tough i got av-13or17 in SPM >.< ! will never forgive u for that ! U were generous tough, gave me a treat in HQ tough i forgot to wish u o ur b'day :P ! My partner when it comes to screwing up in acads :)  been a fun joyful and wonderful journey, with most of spent spent together, will miss u big time in  the future, u 've been doing only things u like, maintain the attitude and do  something great. We have been thru and doe many more things, impossible to mention everthing here. :) U rock bro ! \m/
Always be happy and without regrets....... :)

<p>Teja the Tiger.., Teja the God.One of the coolest friends that I have, who likes games, studies(mostly bijju subjects :P) etc. an all-rounder.Even though we met in the 1st semester itself it was in 2-1 when we  became good friends(bros). It was because of your company the most boring CS subjects that we have were bit more interesting (getting inspiration from you to play mobile games in the class.. :P). I hope you will complete the Projects such as Bananna Os and the liqud processor some of the best ideas given by our ismail bhai(Ananth..). I would never forget the treats that you have given us in ice N spice, mongi and mainly the HQ treat. I hope that you would become Bear Grylls 2.0 and we would see you on TV :P, and finally we wish we could see you in white and white before leaving the campus. And wish you the best for your future.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sachin-irukula">sachin irukula</a></p>

<p>Lean and short are the 1st words anyone can get to their mind at their first look. The “TIGER” of our batch…Teja is a calm guy only if you don’t know him, or else he is one of the most mischievous guy!!!Talk any random stuff to him and he still keeps listening to you, he never gets bored with anything…He was the one who bared with many of my aweful “figures” in the class hours and my nonsense talk after class hours….My “Lathika”(tat’s how I renamed him..god knows y!!). Teja was OS king!!!He knew each end every troubleshooting method of a comp…if u hav any problem regarding ur OS contact this guy…he plays around with computer like “chess”. He is one of the best company in college…he makes me feel free and feel like kid…..I’ll be missing all those funny moments in the class Lathika….I’m sure that you’ll have a bright future ahead…Let’s rock next sem!!!Do stay in touch!!  -Your love :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srinivasa-lahiri">Srinivasa Lahiri</a></p>
