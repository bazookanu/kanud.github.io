<h1 class="page-title">Pooja Anand</h1><p>On the first day in campus, I was going to SAC with my parents (after keeping luggage in my allotted room) for some registration procedure and a cab stopped right in front of SAC. A girl came out and was walking towards us. Looking at her I was wondering, can she be a fresher?? Or is she someone’s younger sister?? (All this wondering because first few girls I met in campus were Chitra, Arunima and Gayathri Dasika who are considerably tall) Then she came and asked something regarding admission procedure and I was relieved there are non-tall girl students too.. :D :P Yes u r right! That was Pooja Anand! She is very conscious about her height (and that’s why wears heels, which btw have given awesome memories in children’s park :P). Jokes apart, she is a very nice friend.. writes very neatly (and is proud of that :P)… studies well… attends what she feels like.. good photographer.. laughs for anything (which sometimes I dont find funny), laughs even more if someone asks her to stop… likes to do ‘crazy’ stuff with friends (though we rarely did, except for flicking ‘something’ :P and those crazy pics last Diwali :D )… plans her work properly and manages to follow the plans pretty well (with few modifications… which she consoles herself are ok to do :D) hates dancing (though she danced in 4th class very nicely)… We worked together in DoPY since very first sem (gave the inductions together :D)… I remember studying together for thermo, Prob/stat (she almost cried coz ppl were asking her doubts all the time n not letting her study) and M3 (on ur bday) …  We have had many more moments to cherish forever… Its been nice knowing you! Will miss you next sem..

<p>Big and Expressive eyes, extremely hard-working lady who puts in her soul in whatever she does....  She is conscious of her height and loves putting on high heels... She is a plethora of talent; being the technical head of DoPY, handling BITSCAN, Compeer club, TT player, awesome singer, painter and has done some brilliant sketching posters... Big fan of Shahrukh Khan (even her email id says that)... Ready to help... Poo... hates dancing... gets really conscious every time... She is dedicated towards studies, you can see her doing night-outs before every exam and her door open for everyone to come and ask for doubts and she will actually sit beside and help them..... No one can beat her in missing meals (:P)... Loves watching FRIENDS and being with friends... enjoys Black-Forest cake, Cold coffee... Pooja, you are really very elegant, smart, sweet and pretty.... don’t get so tensed, be optimistic and confident about yourself..... you are sure to reach the heights.... be in touch, will miss u a lot and take care...  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>Pooja: I think I'll remember her more as the girl who can laugh at anything :D Don't even need to crack any jokes around her, can say anything in a slightly non-serious way and she'll laugh. Worries a lot according to me, but still manages to laugh and smile. As it is said, 'laughter is the best medicine for health' and your laughter also helps others smile, so please never stop laughing. Other than that, I think she kind of likes to get better & better at everything she does, may be by thinking 'for every best case scenario there is a better best case scenario' :P Studies harder and harder for every exam whether she has got excellent marks or demoralizing marks (which is v rare). Also always ready to help in acads or any other thing. Has always encouraged any doubts and cleared them. She hates being tiny (short) :P The name 'flying machine' along with that incident will be ofcource remembered. One more thing, she can make herself look like a complete sweet innocent kiddo or a very strict woman sometimes :P Always remain the same.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
<p>Pooja, also known as ‘the flying machine’, due to an incident in the childrens park, which we will never forget (:D), is the eldest, yet shortest person in my friends-circle! She likes to laugh a lot, sometimes for no apparent reason! She’s good at acads(and almost ‘lives’ in the library) yet sometimes complains a lot about them (even though CS is li8 :P). Very observant, yet sort of colour blind! A very responsible person too; when Rujuta and she were the EMs of MAD, I literally stopped worrying about it, cause I knew they would handle it perfectly. A good photographer, especially when it comes to macro photography... and another friend I’m grateful to DoPY for! All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure if you remember this, but we met on the first day here in the bank. But were properly acquainted only after efforts to round up the Kannada folk on campus were made (I remember some senior crediting you for this). Pooja is one of the most fiercely independent people I have met. A few train journeys from Bangalore and a few classes together, have taught me that she absolutely hates to take support from others where she can do the job herself. She was also the spark which got the highly successful Kannada Ugadi dinner on track. Not afraid to take responsibility. A very good writer and speaker. Practically lived in the library (saw her there whenever I made rare attempts to visit that place). All the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
<p>Chikoo! I can imagine the expression on your face when you read it :P. We met for the first time under funny circumstances when we were trying to console people outside the common room ;) :D. She is a wonderful friend one could have. Very supportive and a great motivator. She is always there to help you out when you are in need. Back in our first year, we(together with bari) did little bit of combined studies :) . Thats how I believe we got close to each other!She was the "doubt-clearer" of our corridor when everyone had common subjects. Her notes are like printed books. She loves to maintain them that way. She is very methodical. She plans out her schedule well in advance and almost manages to follow it _/\_! We have the same set of friends and hence were always together. Its very entertaining to watch her complaining about the "C mess" food :D. The long walks we had back then after dinner were memorable. The non-sense-ish talks in mess are worth mentioning ;). As years passed by our friendship got better and better. You were part if few incidents which i dare forget in my life. One of them worth mentioning is the "Rolling on the Floor" incident in my room. Always have a smile on your face and stop cribbing about silly things in life ;).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
<p>Pooja is one of the most dedicated and hardworking individuals I know. She is extremely responsible and has handled acads as well as many other things successfully: technical head for DOPY, EM for M.A.D. (the name suited quite a bit with you and Ruju as EM’s :P), Compere Club, working for BITSCAN and so on. She is a great speaker and speaks with a confidence I really admire. Every semester she will plan to attend every class and mostly succeeds in it. In a way that helps all of us too coz we get a set of neatly printed notes that are her trademark ;) Also she will always be there to help you solve doubts in any subject. She will plan out for each subject and follow it till the end even if it means doing a night-out. She can be like a cute kid as well as mature lady depending on the situation. Classes and labs became much more bearable coz of you. Not to forget the trips, movies and tv series. Thanks for the angry bird ;) All the best for the future! I am sure you will do great!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>I met Pooja when we were struggling to make our 1st sem timetable in Pranita’s room. She is a big crazy fan of SRK and boasts about her Bangalore city a lot ( :P ). She is a very good photographer, artist, singer and compere. Dances also well but hates it. She always thinks her clean room is dirty :P. We became close friends in our 2nd yr and I was the one who used to go to her room most of the times in a day and bug her for small things.. Luvs chaat (especially paani puri ) a lot. Always conscious about her height and looks. She was mine and Bari’s library buddy in d 2nd yr, when we used just crazily laugh about any stupid thing that used to cum to our minds (rembr d jungle song :P). She is very smart, matured, down to earth, cute (Pooo...), outspoken, fun loving (if we are together can go to extremes :P) and likes to write very neatly. Very hard working.. puts in her heart at whatever she does. She plans out things very nicely and very systematic in working out them. Very helpful and “Doubt clearer” as ppl call her in our corridor. We have had many funny, crazy and emotional talks. I know we have similar taste be it in dressing , movies or music. Will always remember those late nite talks, movies, outings nd fun v hd 2gathr ( rembr Pranita painting our nails :P). Yeah she sometimes gets very tensed for silly silly stuff and “maahir” in missing the meals during the exam time :P. Still waiting for the Baccha gaadi pic wid u nd Bari :P. Yeah I probably won’t forget ur 4th std dance video :P.... Cannot express everything about our friendship in words....Will surely gonna miss u a lot next sem?……… We will enjoy the trip to its fullest extent?!!.... Stay as you are and I am sure you are to reach greater heights……. Thanx for being my friend :)........All d very best cutie with those beautiful eyes?!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-sanjay-vaze">Shruti Sanjay Vaze</a></p>
<p>i havent had chance to know you much on campus. but have always admired your confidence and elegance! wish you luck for future :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apurva-mudgal">Apurva Mudgal</a></p>
<p>Pooja... So much comes to my mind at once... What do I begin with :P ... Okay..first with your beautiful big eyes ( because they impress me the most)...really very expressive.. (those of a traditional young woman you know :) ) Your have a very positive aura, though you never admit it :P  You maintain a perfect balance between work, fun , emotions... a nice blend of creativity, intellect ,fun-loving attitude and still an objectivity in life which astounds me. Its been great to have you as my neighbour...listening to Vydehi .. 5 mins :P ... or sitting in your clean, windy room n asking you for ideas to clean mine :P or discussing doubts with you ( The most conceptual and helping  girl I have come across you know ) _/\_ I somehow wonder how you can keep a balance between everything... enjoy so much ..study all the more ... and crib during exams (even more :P  You need to take li8 sometimes.. Life isn't meant to be so perfect and so ideal ) ..  You have been a very mature person solving so many of my silly doubts not only related to acads but several other stupid curious questions.. you also have been a motivating force... Night outs during exams..DND notes on your door..still teaching so many ppl just before exams ...  God has gifted you with lots of patience and tolerance ...  And I really thank God for giving me such a cute little talented Poo..whom I always irritate and she very nobly doesn't mind.. Love you .... May you get your dream home in future , which you will decorate a lot I know :P  . Stay the way you are ( bas tension jyaada mat lena :) ) You always rock !! :) All the best for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>

POooja ! :)
From someone i hardly knew in first year to one of my bestest friends here! we have come a long way :)
And yes, this thanx also goes sumwt to dopy and priyanka :)
I first noticed her in the common room after big break was over and people were complimenting her compering. I thot that ws so awesome standing in front of soo many screaming people and hold ur own and speak calmly and correctly!
So even though most people think she looks small and all, my first impression of hers was of someone very mature and graceful.
And then came zephyr :P
That was one long fun-filled night! (still angry dat u ppl put my pic wn i went to sleep though >.<).
SHe was the one who i took all the videos wid and then sat editing them for a long long time. The brainstorming and the wierd ideas v came up wid were seriously funny :D
But yes it turned out really gr8 and for the first time i realised how amazing a team affort can be in creating something good! This girl has an amazing sense of dedication and commitment to whatever she does and she can go on and on for a really really long time without giving up or getting much tired.
Came to knw that during d zephyr video.
And of course then there was dopy! 
Hung out wid her so much becoz of that and came to know her really well.
She looks calm and serious but she can b completely spontaneous and up for any kind of craziness :P
And she is really good at photography too!
The stop motion video that she and sandeep made became one of the best creations of dopy! Felt so proud of being in dopy dat day :)
And then came third year :)
Her being the technical coordinator we had to work together a lot all the time.
Whether it was the inductions or the training sessions or MAD (phew that was so tiring :P )and even scolding the juniors (even more tiring >.<:P)
I felt so lucky to have her with me all dat tym and i prob cudnt have dun it wid ne1 else and had so much fun doing it !
And all dose meetings wid sandeep O.o
I wud've killed him by now if i had to meet him alone all dose tyms :P
And she as always always been there for me!
A gem of a person! If you didnt know her, you missed out something huge from ur campus life for sure!
So many memories i have with her..sitting in institute bldg, NC, the children's park and the flying incident :P, my attempts to lift u:P and so many more!
She is a big dose of happiness packed in a small capsule :P 
Always making people around her smile,always laughing no matter what, great at acads and very very hardworking.
Very pretty with beautiful long eyelashes that you just cant miss :P and can look eqaully awesum in traditional as well as jeans !
I will say the same thing i said abt shruti..dis just cant be goodbye..or even next sem wn v finally leave..v will def keep meeting :P
A rocking trip and an even more rocking sem ahead! Let's enjoy! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
