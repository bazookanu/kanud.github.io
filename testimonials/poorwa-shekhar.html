I cant even remember where and when I first met u, but I do remember that we became instant friends since the time we met and u hav stood as a steadfast friend since then (thank you :D) Every memory with u have been memorable… be it our late night talks… our exam time preparation (ES II would not have been possible without you!!)… our never-ending debates and arguments…. Our happy and sad moments… the fights between us and with others( u know wat I mean :P)… every moment we have shared together… I m gonna miss all these and lot more… wish u all the best in ur life!!! Hope we get our PS-II together and the legacy continues :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankita-mahapatra">Ankita Mahapatra</a></p>
<p>y0 toti, I still remember that we were introduced early in 1st sem by Ruchika...although we didn't talk much during that time.....time passed and we started talking...one thing i admire about you is your unstoppable talking ability about anything..there can't be any silence when you're around...be it through your endless stories or by your aadat of singing songs all the time......and by all I mean ALL THE TIME......yaad hai exam mein bhi tu gaana gaa rahi thi and u had to be told to stop :P......well u have a really lovely voice and aapki paintings toh alag level ki hai(esp. kuch kuch :P)....you are one of the people who will be up till late night(or shall i say early morning) and 
still manage to attend all classes and from there comes your imba teaching skills...there were so many times when you saved me just before the exams by teaching me ES, AMOS, DMV, Consys and so on right from scratch.....thanx a lott for that...and...i must say........u are ek number ki nautanki(:P).....bas naatak karna hota hai har cheez mein....be it anything...chahe padhai ho(har 
exam se pehle ping karna ki yaaar mera kuch nahi huya and fir ekdam jhakaas marks laana) chahe timepass(wo chatting ka k and m incident and many more)...har cheez...well, it was really nice knowing you....especially the last two sems....finally, i would just like to say....be as you are...dont change...carefree  mast innnocent pagali(:P).......be in touch...i m sure you'll reach 
geat heights in future....keep rocking\m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sarang-shamshery">Sarang Shamshery</a></p>
<p>Intelligent, witty, charming, beautiful (I am sure many will agree to this one) are some of the adjectives that describe Poorwa. A very supportive friend, I am lucky to have known her since my first day in BITS (actually we met a few hours before that if you remember). I can’t imagine all these three years without her. It’s always fun listening to her stories and her petty fights. In the middle of each fight she would innocently say “I don’t even remember why we started it”. She is a person who always has the latest information on what’s happening in the campus. She has an amazing quality of remembering people which by the way has saved me from a lot of embarrassments many a times. Making decisions is bit of a task for her: be it a pen, a dress or anything in the world for that matter, it takes her hours to make a final choice. I will cherish all those philosophical and “what we really want to do in life” discussions (in which we never even got close to the answer :P) just hours before the exams. I had the best time in PS1 with her. I remember getting all emotional on the last day of PS and then realizing that we would be meeting soon in 15 days :). Thanks a lot for being there with me all the way through. I am sure we will always be good friends. May you achieve everything you want in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>

<p>Always smiling, lovable, makes u happy when she is around...my mech buddy. With her i have shared all my frustration for mechanical engineering,..She is an amazing artist...no1 will know better than me who has seen all her art work coming out in cdc classes :P :P
love you lots...be always the way u r...ever smiling and talking talking :P
All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>She sings very well, bit of a moody person and fun to be with.  You could not find a person who would draw such good diagrams as her. Conclusion: She is good at drawing :P. I had a lot of classes common with her in my first sem …so all the sems after that, I missed one brilliant person sitting on the chair besides me and thinking almost the same way that I thought and wondering!!! Can someone think so much like me for a given problem.. She is very beautiful :P… you could find people hitting on her from all directions if you live with her for long..no offence :P…May I tel you her secret! She is waiting for a person who would give her a diamond ring!! I would miss the night walks with you people next time I come back to campus.. :) How I wish the campus life with you would never end. Hope I would find you around whenever we happen to be nearby.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khayali-jain">Khayali Jain</a></p>
<p>Poorwa maharani ji !!! she is an ultimate nautanki bandi i have ever met ... Manages to tell that i have not studied anything one night before exam ( even though she is about to finish her revision :P)...  But yes its always fun to talk to her ... ultimate  chilled out and fun loving jolly person.. Hope you remain the same in future also ... Best of luck for the future and do stay in touch with me :)) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saikat-mitra">Saikat Mitra</a></p>
<p>She tells everyone that she studies on the last day.( Ob no one is gonna believe that becoz of her performance in the tests.) She has a habit of calling others 'phodu'. But I guess she never looks in the mirror. She in a lot sincere when it comes to attending lectures or writing reports but this image was erased at the time of Quark when we never saw her working though she was EM.
EMs of Burnout had even declared 500/- prize money to be given to a person whoever spots her at the work. ( :P kidding) (no need to tell that there was no winner :P) She keeps her status something like 'DEAD' just before exams. Note this is a strategy in this competitive world to suppress the opponents :P. She is going to be the next AOE champion( coz of sarang ob). Being in our group for labs, she is the one who notes down all the readings and does the calculations most of the time. 
I always enjoy pinging her at some random time ( especially today in  the morning at 3.30 before the exam ) and
The last thing.... Bahut phodti hai yaaar koi use thoda control karne bolo pls....

<p>Poorwa, my secret friend :P. I don’t know how many ppl know, dat we share a good friendship, I guess very few. This has become a cliché but still, where do I start from?...a lot to say….mmm…..ya….Until commencement of our MT2 labs and CPL I didn’t even know who actually was Poorwa . I hardly saw u before dat. For me the first impression of u was of a nerdy girl :P but only after talking to u I realized u r not even a tad like that. You are a complete chilled out person. Always keeps smiling/giggling (difficult to differentiate between the two :P)……Poorwa is about simplicity, kindheartedness and carefree attitude. She’s as carefree as a 5 pointer (no offence to 5 pointers, I have been there :P) and yet fodofies each and every course every single time. I dunno but somehow she manages to excel in everything she does. You are a pure genius to me :P. I still can’t figure it out how’d u do that…... Undoubtedly u r one of the most genuine person I got a chance to know. She’s supertalented. She’s got a gr8 voice (here gr8 means exceptionally good as she is classically trained), she makes full use of it by humming songs all the time, she knows “kathak” which she learnt in her kindergarten yrs :P but remarkable thing is dat she still remember each and every mudra, with its name which is quite phenomenal. She’s also brilliant in drawing/sketching/painting. But the best part about her is….that she’s crazy simple….she doesn’t like to celebrate her b’day, doesn’t want ppl to know when’s her b’day, doesn’t like gifts…. that doesn’t mean she’s less interesting…..which I know for a fact that there’s somewhere deep inside lies the “aatma” of a cheetah which is avidly waiting to be unleashed :P. She’s very fun-loving girl. She’s very affable. I must say u r also a bit temperamental :P yet doesn’t lose your temper which is a good thing :) . She also possess a witty sense of humour, the emergence of which obviously depends on her mood :P. U r also a tad superstitious :|. I’ll always remember few things like how u were so adamant to pay me for the pmfm book that I got it for u despite of me repeatedly saying “that return me the book after u have completed ur sem”(which I wud also be needing in my cdc’s) and we had a long argument over ur stupid reason of not using a borrowed book…the innumerable treats that u owe me for ur innumerable accomplicements. A lot more to say but I think it’s enough for a testimonial :P….Wish u achieve things which others only dream of achieving….I’ll cherish our friendship for life…..Stay the way you are….CHEERS!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-jain">Rahul Jain</a></p>
<p>I met Poorwa only 5 months ago, I wish i had met her earlier. It would have certainly helped my cg :P She's probably a genius coz she starts studying when I do and still has twice my cg :D She's very sweet and helpful and sometimes hyper :P She's always been there to help me whether its GRE advice or anything else even if I ping her in the middle of the night! She's also great in arts. Had fun sitting together for MED. My friends always tease me with her because of the amount of time we spent together :D Really sad we have PS in different sems.Keep in touch.All the best for your future! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Second year, second sem, MT2 Electrical Lab : I am late (as usual), not in my lab coat, just out of bed. Plus I knew that this "topper girl" was in my group, my dept. and all serious and everything. Damn, what a way to make an impression. But what transpired over the rest of the semester made me realize that Poorwa is not your typical high-scoring nerd queen. She is, perhaps, the most chilled out person you will meet. And a miraculous gift to you, if she is your lab partner :P  Always happy, always smiling, always helpful, a little impulsive and evidently very talented, any time spent with her is an absolute delight. And despite her carefree nature, she always performs excellently in whatever she does. She got a 10 GPA in that semester. All signs of a genius...a little crazy, yes, but brilliant. She is destined for greatness. Cheers to all our fun moments and all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
