<h1 class="page-title">Pradeep</h1><p>He is one of my earliest friends in bits.Our trips to senior rooms for watching movies and games,Late night chats in akshith's room in first year, were memorable.We used to argue about lot of logics and new ideas,movies  and all.He watches almost every movie and gives critic's view about it,he might have watched almost all imdb top movies and still bugs me to tell new movies(:P).He shows a lot of enthusiasm in learning softwares and planning outings.
He is one of the people who influenced me to start Dota in my 2-1.We always had a friendly rivalry in go-karting or and other physical stunts like high jumpnig etc.Hope we will continue to be touch,best of luck for the future.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhinay-choday">Abhinay Choday</a></p>

<p>You are the very first friend of me in the college apart from KK. I remember the times we have discussed on some crazy topics :P. You used to study well in the 1st sem and then your downfall eventually after getting the laptop among all of our group in your 1st sem end. I can say a biggest lap and lan gaming addict. Maintain your serious ness which you used to have in your first sem and you would reach gr8 heights. Never forget I am there for you in the future too...... :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>Sincere,humble & genuine. The best part is his actions are always from the bottom of his heart. He risks everything for the people he cares. It was fun being with you at the DORA stall. Keep in touch ---sumith  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
