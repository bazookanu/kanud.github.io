<h1 class="page-title">Pradyumn Agarwal</h1><p>Prady Lal is the BOSS of our corridor in every sense . Can really see his guy bossing around his underlings to death in near future :P . Jokes apart , he is a great guy and a true phodu in every sense . A great planner , this guy has planned all of our outings to date and each trip has been better than the last . A real people's person , this guy is bound to have a great future . Just wouldn't want him as my boss :P .   Really , couldn't have asked for a better neighbour .

<p>After getting my praises sung by sirjee...Pradyum aka Fatty Lal I have to pay back in kind :P To cut a long story short, he is THE most in your face person I have ever met. Whoever he accepts as a friend, he will worry about them and poke and prod them to distraction (but his heart is in the right place bless his soul). If you are not his friend, then you are the generic person who gets a huge torrent of abuse just for being you(and I might add daily :P). Again a really cool friend to have, he cant drag his fat ass to class (due to certain misadventures with a bucket) and thus spends all his free time studying in his room as signified by his 8p cg. I am pretty sure he will be big in the future (Mercedes/Ford/Ferrari CEO anyone? ) as bossing around people is his second nature because he has huge talent in leadership. I wish him the very best of luck.   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>
<p>Pradyumn Agarwal. He is a guy whom you would love to have as a friend. Intelligent, practical, sensible and a great food connoisseur, he has naturally good managerial skills and has planned some of our outstanding trips. A very down-to-earth person who is always ready to help his friends out, no matter how big the problem is, or how big the problem he will be into if he helps! His presence only is enough to light up a gloomy environment. Its always fun to have him around and keep getting lots of ideas and advises. I am sure he will be successful in whatever he does in his future. I wish all the very best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>

<p>Pradyum the most active member in the labs. He is the most positive person in the campus, intelligent, hard working, never panics about any problem, fun to hang out with, a winner and a good guy. There are no negative things about pradyum except maybe short temper but he never lost it on me so i can rule that out as well. No doubt he'll excel where ever he goes and i wish him a bright future and a peaceful life!! Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>Pradyumn Agarwal aka Fatty is the Don of biolabs. He is jovial, easy going guy who can live up any situation with his jokes and one-liners. He has good managerial skills. I wont forget the way you make the people do the work by kicking their a**, the way you used to plan the trips, the arguments between you and TAJ. It is always fun to have him around and hangout. He manages academics and enjoyment with ease. He is always ready to lend his ears and a hand to his friends. His dedication and hard-work will help him soar high in the sky of opportunities.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>

<p>First  thing i wanted to say is  im a big fan of pradyumn  ? . 
I really wanted to see this guy from suffering with any problem because i’m observing him since my  first year nothing suffered him  or frustrated him .he is really good at manage the things at last minute without getting even small  amount of nervousness. he is my workshop partner everybody thinks that girl as partner will be good but u will simply change your opinion once u work with him. He is that much friendly . u will enjoy as well as u learn the things ?. he is capable of dealing any kind of situation with cool attitude .very fun loving guy with great intelligence and also very energetic .you can always learn something from him .i really like when u say li8 because u really mean it (:P :D). He is also great leader u can easily notice this quality if u go out with him atleast once. In one word i can say that he is a versatile person with great energy.
Pradyumn without u workshop and biolabs will be pathetic man .....love u man ?  im gonna really miss ur company   .all the best for ur future :)?

<p>I am lucky to have such an awesome neighbor. I used to feel shy initially to talk to you all in my first year when you all are playing uno in the corridor, I sometimes used to walk complete round to get to my room :P. You are studious and also I love the times when we used to play nfs together. You are very particular about things and that discipline will place you ahead from the crowd. I also love the times during exams whenever you buzz me to study and worry about me sometimes.:D. Its sad though to miss the most lovable person in our corridor. I wish all the very best for you and never forget me buddy ........ :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>Pradyumnaaaaaa agarwal (as per “chotu”)  aka fatty, I came to know the  “real” him in 3rd  year labs and classes  ( although we had a few common classes and labs in 2nd year but that time he always seemed busy with work : P :P). A guy with good bossy and managerial skills, kuch bhi kaam nikalwaana  ho toh isko bol doh!!. Extremely hard-working, dedicated person with  chillax personality, but at the same time too lazy to go to classes :P ( still manages to get high marks  ). Ask him 10 hrs before exam he will say “haan sab ho gaya bas thoda sa  portion bacha hai). 
I still remember how u ,me ,chirayu, suresh used to do time pass during genetics lab hours and u dragging me to IC everyday after the lab (  Arre ,”the B wrd” , chal nahi toh  yahi gaad doonga, kitna padhega). Had some awesome funny moments with him. All the very best for your bright future and may u own  Lamborghini one day and we can go for a ride someday . Cheerssss!!!  :)

<p>As much as i have come to know him, a person who knows  his stuff and proud about it. Energetic. Has a knack of getting work done. Has a helpful nature and great leading capabilities. The way he speaks normally is kind of like he is frowning, and irritates me sometimes, but we all have our quirks :)
Great going man! Hope you do what you want to do :) All the Best.
PS. Let's see if we can have one last trip :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>

<p>Prady, i still remember the first time we met, him sitting in his room with a  stubborn look on his face , his mother introduced us both " saying see there are people from north as well".  I first thought of him as a shy and reclusive person.but as i came to know him more, i found him exactly the opposite.His domineering nature made him the organizer, leader of our group, corridor boyz. His management skills are quite exceptional whether managing all our outings or managing  basketball in spree ,his work was worthy of high praises. i cannot forget all our after dinner walks, and i am quite sure that during this past 3 years he had abused almost everyone in the campus.Coming to the academics, topper of almost every pre CDC mechanical courses, among the toppers in bio, he has quite an exceptional mind and the way he manages his time between studies and other things, is quite commendable.The varied qualities he posses,hints towards a very bright and successful future for him. hoping we will remain in touch. cheers! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-khanna">Tarun Khanna</a></p>

<p>Well what a long time it has been. Atleast hostel mein koi toh banda bio kaa thaa :P. I think we know each other very well since the first day(Kota background common thaa hee). Thanks to your bossy, understanding and li'l bit compromising nature that "corridor boyz" could go out to all the road trips, movies and dinners. Absolute best in planning things and taking no tension \m/. Baaki kabhi apna point galat maanega nahi, truth accept hota nahi %-), phir toh @##$%$$ start ho jaata hai  :D  :D. Does real well when commited to something(book kee saare sawaal karne kee liye nahi hote, leave some suspense for exams). On a more serious note future toh set hai hee either owner/CEO/MD of a real big company otherwise blackberry kaa showroom hai hee :P.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>
