<p>Akka, as everyone calls her... she is really the one... With a billion dollar smile.. ( or sud I say.. Orbit smile)... she is one of those really great friends... who not only cares for you but scolds you when you are wrong... looks very pretty... gets amazing food from home and then shares it with everyone... she can do anything for her friends.... Being the spree coordinator for ArtsnDeco.. she has been one of the best coordinators department could have... loves shopping and is fond of footwears... I really had an awesome time with her... be it our corridor gossips or the POM group... remember the street play.. (I played your mother’s character)... it was awesome time.... you calling me with that name >.< , your advices, smile and everything is gonna be missed...  be in touch... n keep smiling... the margarita on the champagne...

<p>Pranathi!! A very hardworking figure... will do anything to make something work when it comes to..'c'mon, lets make it happen.'
