<h1 class="page-title">PRANAV MEHROTRA</h1><p>Pranav- a perfect blend of smartness, intelligence, funny still humble, down to earth. He is one of those people in campus who have inspired me to work harder and aim higher. I was always scared of him till my third year, but once getting to knw him in third year, I found him to be such an amazing person whom everyone would love to b friends with. All the best for your life and keep  rocking _/\_ :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Havent seen a bigger chakka/nob/pesterer in the entire campus. Bahut dimaag chat leta hain but awesome person to be around. Guess we've spent a huge part of our BITS Life (on and off campus)  with each other. A freaking geek Nob is the most profit oriented person you'll see! Worked together on almost every project and have loved every moment of it. Keep your smiley face till death man (and its gonna be payback time very soon!!)

<p>It will be 11 years together once we complete college (have been studying together since 6th standard). A true genius, combined with the hard work he does, he truly deserves to be at the top of the batch. Admired him all along, it is wonderful being friends with him. Always ready to help, you can can count on him when you are in trouble. He can be your guide. Already achieved a lot, i hope he can reach greater heights and has more achievements in his bag. Best of Luck Nob!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Pranav needs no introduction ……. I have known him since Class 6 and trust me, he has transformed a lot after coming to BITS. Sadly we didn’t get the same hostel but that didn’t keep us apart. I used to drop by his room every time in 1-1 and 1-2. He is very sharp, hardworking, intelligent, helpful and finds solutions even in the worst circumstances. His personality is completely like that of a businessman and he is surely going to earn a lot :P. How can I forget chocolates ????? This guy has been eating chocolates every day for the past God knows how many years. And he never reveals his supply source :)  Wish you all the best for your future and I hope we keep on meeting after our BITS life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Pranav is the oldest of my friends in BITS. Living in the same building, attending the same entrance coaching classes and subsequently joining BITS, he has been a great influence for me. There is no better personification of certain highly underrated attributes such as dedication, hard work and single-minded focus. Over the years, i have seen him achieve so much (including certain aspects that i never expected ;) :P ).  Best of Luck and Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arjun-mathew-eranacal">Arjun Mathew Eranacal</a></p>
<p>Pranav Mehrotra! I got to know him in our PS-I at HAL, Blore.. :) That has been one of the most amazing experience of my life! I remember going out almost each day with all of you and roaming around streets of blore.. walking for miles without thinking where we are going.. You are a really fun person to be with and i really enjoyed the time we spent together.. I will never forget the moments that we had in our 'little family'.. :P The never ending damsharas, mafia and just sitting in front of HAL waiting for everyone was awesome.. But the best was our nandihill trip! (or mabe wonderla! or HardRock cafe! i dont know i am confused.. :P ) It is so great that we became friends and hope to continue that in future.. (conditiond applied** (you know what i mean.. :D )) Keep smiling and spreading smiles.. All the best for your future.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/avni-goyal">Avni Goyal</a></p>
<p>Flashback 5years ago. I met him as a chashmish moochadd. I thought he was Nepali for some reason. Knew he was smart though. Over the two years of Vidyarthi, he promoted films for me. Singing title tracks of films in the most atrocious of voices. He came as a fan of Atif Aslam and pop-love songs. 

Flashforward 5 years to the present. Hes a proud owner of a frameless pair of specs that rests on a (almost) clean shaven face. I know he is smart. But I also know that hes a rascal! He does not sing title tracks anymore and Atif Aslam has become a strict nono.


Pranav Mehrotra is easily the biggest baniya this campus has ever seen. Life is a race for him and all in between is a profit-loss statement :-) And despite all this bhaag-daud hes been a helluva friend and buddy! 
Have spent some great times with him and done some great things with him. And he's always been there for me. In exchange I have given him company to Bogmalo (by foot :-P) and coffee at Mongini's. :-D
But what continues to amaze me is his penchant for scheming and planning and plotting and messing with people's heads and lives! Keep up ur keedas dude and keep that laugh pasted on your face. Its almost grown into an integral part of your identity! :-D
Been awesome with you all these years bro-tanki pe chadhna, video shooting karna, Mori ke saath Curlies ki woh shyaam, woh aadha shot! :-D

Hope u do EXTREMELY well in life at whatever you wanna do. And its perfectly plausible that 10yrs down the line if i wanna meet you, Ill probably find u at Mongi sipping coffee. :-)

Have an awesome life bro! :-D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maanit-mehra">Maanit Mehra</a></p>
<p>Meh-rotrey! Isse badi ladki maine aaj tak nahi dekhi !! This guy has to know and gossip everything about everyone... Gawd and he enjoys every bit of it! And He loves managing people (read messing their heads!! :P) ... He's a true manager at heart!! :D Partly, I attribute that to DoCW which I know has a special place in his life...  Well, I and Nob have had a kind of a 'Tu Tu Main Main' relationship all these years... I sometimes feel like laughing looking back! And after all those mindless silent fights which sometimes used to last really long, this guy comes up with this devilish hug which miraculously still works all the time :D ( I hate it but can't help it!) We have had our share of some epic experiences too. Curlies, Doodhsagar and all those times will be fondly remembered.. All in all, life wouldn't have been the same in BITS but for your keeda-kandis, baniya-panti and yeah, your constant naggings!. Hope, we shall cherish this special bond of ours for all the years to come... ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurabh-nayak">Saurabh Nayak</a></p>
