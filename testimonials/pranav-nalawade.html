<h1 class="page-title">Pranav Nalawade</h1><p>You can get anything that is in his hand, by just tickling him. Our friendship is beyond “chemistry”. He is inspiration, if you are getting low marks. He is playlist, if you have taste of good music. He is relief, if you are stressed at exam time. He is IMDB, if you dont know your genre.  Dexter, This guy is very dangerous. Murder is his obsession. And he is crazy about madness. Go and look at wallpaper near his study table.  At times, you can find him reading about suicides, and one more favorite thing of his is…….umm…this is too private to say here. He hates me for my like of hindi songs as I make him listen those during exam time and I hate his meditation tunes.
But one thing for sure, you can’t find a person like him. He is one of his own. Don’t expect him to show emotions. Yiu can’t find one.  But somehow  I know, he loves me.

<p>My first friend on Campus : 'Pranav' is just so different from the entire pack .His humble,sweet way of speaking ,even when he is angry can make your conversation with him so cheerful . Never seen a more sincere guy ,who studies not for marks but for knowledge. Lives a life of happiness ,i rarely see him pissed off or sad.Great taste in music.  A hardworking guy. One thing he is going to miss is Chem labs where he spent heck lot of time. And pranav,u can never forget me,I am very sure . I can tell, this guy is :'Once a friend always a friend'
Great guy to hang out with.   :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-kumar">Amit Kumar</a></p>
<p>Pranav….. is anything but ordinary…He has his own way of making the most complex of all situations sound simple..…and complicate the simplest of the situations… he has a knack for switching between topics and comes out with the most bizarre ones at the oddest  of times :P … He is a calm and composed individual  who sees nothing but positivity around himself and always chooses to overlook the bad things  in people (Hence never satisfying my constant need for gossip :P ). Pranav is a guy filled with sensitivity and care, always ready to help you even before you ask him for his help… His face shows only three expressions… his brilliant smile , a look of utter confusion or the “excuse me I’m in my own world” look…After three years in college I have learnt to put people in categories , but this guy is not a stereotype… if you ever think you’ve figured him out, he will surprise you the very next day… you can say just about anything to him, and still not offend him…  at most what you’ll get is “ Oh! Man...” …”Its ok ‘BE’ ” … which makes you feel really comfortable hanging out with him… I don’t know how helpful IMA or for that matter any of our shitty  chemistry courses were, but what I do know is that it helped me find an awesome friend…. You mister better get ready to tolerate my cribbing once again for an entire year ( though I’m moving on from chemistry  CDCs to chemical CDCs.. :P)…  Ok jokes apart…You’re a great guy… may you continue to be different…and bring a difference to whatever you do…wherever you go! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>

Only guy with same music taste as me( a big coldplay fan like me) and I love him for that :) ….gud basketball player(dunno why he left practicing )…..always eager to learn something new :)….a big FRIENDS’ fan and coz of him only I watched it( thanx for making me watch this epic TV show)……always brings lot of things to eat from home after vacations (:-*, sorry for eating most of those)…. A bit different from my other friends but a very close one and we also have one more year ahead of us together as a neighbour again and as branchmates :). I cannot imagine a better neighbour than u…I think he is the only neighbour in BITS who if u r listening to a song…knocks ur door and says…”volume badha na yaar”!!!.... kismat saath di to same company mein hi job bhi legegi :P….. stay in touch :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shashi-bhushan">SHASHI BHUSHAN</a></p>
