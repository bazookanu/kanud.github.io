<h1 class="page-title">Pranav Prakash</h1><p>Prankesh Tiwari has been my neighbour for a good 2.5 years now, and what a neighbour to have! We call him Butters, after the South Park character, and for good reason too. Innocent, gullible, harmless, adorable - this guy is one of the most decent and warm-hearted people that I have had the privilege of knowing. Many's the time I have barged into his room, grabbed his iPod, plonked myself on his bed and played games on it for hours on end. His room becomes the common room during any exam, with chairs being dragged in and out, and peals of laughter from sharang or nachi emanating from it. A lover of good food, he is cribs about his mom's cooking skills (or lack thereof), and always brings generous supplies from every visit back home. A certified slave, along with Vinay, this guy's shamelessness on the kick-volleyball field is baffling and commendable at the same time. Even after losing to me and chintz for 3 years in a row, he comes back for more, yelling 'We'll see!'. His antics are legendary (the 'fuck' during his POM presentation, his handball during slam), and has provided us with hours of amusement. I'll truly miss the warm smile and 'Dada!' greeting that I wake up to every day. One of my most cherished friends, this fellow 'Bihari', will go a long way in life. But he'll still remain a slave, though :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Never knew him till my 3rd year but later on we became very good friends. Typical dude kinda guy, he is witty and always high on energy.Too much concerned about his acads though :P , a good footballer too. Had a great time with you man!! cheers :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>Pranky...a familiar face during my first year...we became friends when he shifted to our floor in the 2nd sem and I must admit he lit the corridor alive with his presence(albeit his dark complexion).He has been a special friend to me,considering that he is the only guy with whom i have shared my deepest secrets(Bogmalo talks :P),and although nothing came off it,he will always remain my "go-to" guy in the future.A textbook "dude",he is cool,calm and easy and talking to him is always a breeze.This gentle character meta-morphs into a Jharkandi-goon when angry,and is the only guy my campus life to have physically attacked me(breaking his own leg in the process:P).His tendency of being a cleanliness-freak is well known and has perhaps the best-kept room in the hostel.Well, this testimonial cannot be complete without a mention of our football exploits together,Slam 10,11,12 pre-spree 2011,your handball and red card still remains part of AH-4 folklore.He is also part of a elite group of midfielders(Anish,Ayaan) to have overshadowed me in midfield,Pranky impressed Viren,Arbab and co. so much that his brilliance became the subject of the after match breakfast discussion of CH-1.I am sure that next year is going to be a fun-riot and you are going to be a big part of it(screw the eni cdc's).And one advice-don't try beating me ever again,it will save you a crape bandage.:P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/asim-ali">ASIM ALI</a></p>
<p>Pranky! Got to know him well only in our second year and what a great company he's been! A very friendly person. Adored by everyone. Its impossible not to like him actually.Used to take lite earlier but has become quite serious about acads of late. Keeps crying all the time! An ardent Man Utd and Barca fan. Very good at football himself, playing an important role in our back to back Slam titles. Quite possibly the best and the most enthusiastic kick-volley player in our hostel. Kinda okay in cricket. A really good leg-side player :P.He certainly has had more number of bike trips than anyone on campus so far. Goes to Panjim every now and then for the most frivolous of reasons! The Pizza delivery boy of our hostel :P. Enjoys life to the fullest. You can always expect him to be in the thick of action. Mujh pe Chaudna kaafi pasand hai! Have really good memories associated with him, be it kick-volley, Football, jogging( You gotta increase your stamina! :P), Bogmalo or the epic Utorda party. Long live and prosper!
Cheers!

<p>Prankesh! Prakie! Tiwari! Mr prakash, a fellow United devotee, pranky is always out to explore Goa. He's our junk food delivery man. One of the most warm, chilled out and decent fellows I've ever met. We've played Futsal and BPL together and it was an absolute blast. Pranky's hostel foot-volley skills are legendary. We've had some mind-blowing times, organizing foot-volley for those Haryan de launde @ SPREE :P Bogmalo, utorda, Batch party(we've partied like hell), the birthday bashes and BITS FC matches! Pranky, you are going to be sorely missed. He's to spending PS-II in Bangalore and taking off where we left off! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>"Aye, what is this?" (in the most whiny tone you can think of) When I first met Pranky, I thought he was a gavaar from Ranchi. And he turned out to be a gavaar from Ranchi. Proof is that he speaks much softer and slowly in English, than in Hindi. Very peculiar fellow, sometimes I wonder how such an organism was born in the first place. Lavish spender and party animal, these rural folk are getting too sophisticated for their own good. Pranav is always the dark horse when it comes to bidding for football competitions on campus. He also famously got a zero in CAS after taking an extra sheet. If we end up doing PSII together, one thing I will not have to worry about is housekeeping. Happy times at the dam in Ranchi!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>

<p>I met him as Pranav Prakash. Laboured (well, not really, he’s the labourer here) under the misconception that that was his name for a full year. Only to find out his true surname of ‘Tiwari’ that authenticated his Bihariness and explained his undying love for Ranchi & U.P as well as the hard-headedness with which he defended it. I’ve known Pranky since his days in AH4 104. Our batch’s very own pizza-delivery boy is one of the kindest, most innocent & warm-hearted people I’ve ever had the good fortune of calling a friend. He’s someone who values his friends more than anything else. A true friend indeed. However, when it comes to talking about him, all the value-education textbook ideals take a backseat, Pranky’s antics take the cake. Be it his legendary jogging phase (which ended abruptly after his historic loss in a race with a girl) or his trademark “Heh, bhenkelaude” exclamations in public or the room cleaning OCD, he’s done Ranchi proud with his shenanigans. Pranky’s football & futsal exploits are stuff of legend. Be it the discussion of the (re- x 17) demption match or the epic red-card incident, they never get old. But beneath the bumbling, goofy character is a complete gem of a person – patient, understanding and the quintessential nice guy. Pranky knows how to live the good life. He always seems to have a never-ending flow of cash, which keeps him busy in trying out the myriad food joints Goa has to offer. Yet, somehow, I never ended up mooching off him. I’ll miss his trademark greetings from his vantage point every time I enter AH4 (with a book in his hand that he hasn’t read anything out of for the past hour), the subsequent cross-corridor shouting matches, the sporadic late-night meetings with him, Sharang, Ali et al in their corridor – heck, I’ll even miss killing time standing in the AH4 courtyard chucking stones onto his room door trying to extract one “Kaun hai be!” out of him. Koi nahi Tiwaran. Party abhi baaki hai! 
P.S. Ranchi DOES NOT rule.
