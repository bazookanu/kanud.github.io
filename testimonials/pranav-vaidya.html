<h1 class="page-title">Pranav Vaidya</h1><p>Pranav Vaidya :P 
Don't know where to begin and not sure i can end! You added many many laughs to the most boring of days. Your QODs pop up in mind even with the slightest references here and there and one cant help but laugh yet again :D So many memories to keep with me.. the hair-pulling and bag-pulling and the shoe-lace tying and of course, the "sword-fight" :P Irritating as some of them were, i will definitely miss them. You are awesome the way you are ! Don't 'grow up' and become boring :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
<p>Pranav- One of the few people I have known since before BITS (Thanks to NTSE classes). Popularly known as the QOD-master for his amazing ability to generate QODs, that have entertained us since our first year. Not to mention, ‘The Shiny Shoes’ incident which has been etched in my memory forever! Besides this, an avid TV series watcher, a former math lover, cricket enthusiast, a book hater and a great friend. One of his goals, as I recall and quote, is “to make a language that only I will understand”. Pranav _/\_<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>One of the few Bitsians i have known since before BITS. My neighbor and a very good friend. We have had so much fun together and done so many silly things in our BITS life, be it the shining shoes incident or the soap powder incident, we have had so many fun times that will never be forgotten. Pranav has a unique ability to say totally irrelevant things at random times , usually when we are having dinner together, generating a vast amount of QOD's that we shall not forget :D. He likes watching football (Manchester united fan) and TV shows , watching random episodes of random TV shows at odd times (particularly during exams).
All in all he is a great friend and is fun to hang out with. Hope you keep making QODs for us to cherish :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/param-prabhu-alvenkar">Param Prabhu Alvenkar</a></p>
<p>Pranav is probably the best neighbour one can hope for. He's very well mannered, has a good stock of food in his room more often than not and has provided excellent tech support for the last 3 years :D He's very friendly, very helpful and it's always very nice talking to him. He's a genuinely nice guy and has offered excellent advice on many occasions. He also has a great sense of humour is famous for his legendary QODs. We have had many memorable, fun filled moments together and it has been awesome having you around. All the best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Pranav aka cybtech (the latter was more used in 1st year by me :P) is a very mischievous guy with weird philosophies! (like only girls are supposed to b irritated (:|) and ‘I don’t like to talk in language that people around me don’t understand’ ) I know him since 1-2 (doesn’t feel like you joined DoPy in 2nd sem) and a very good friend since then.. I first thought he is a very silent, innocent, shy-to-talk-to-people type guy but later on I came to know his true nature... He is a real QOD maker :P He just makes up random (or out of context) statements… He watches a lot of tv series, even during exams. He is quite a lazy person w.r.t. acads (though you have improved a lot now). Always decides to study but never feels like or doesn’t know what to study.. :P Whenever asked to do something his first question will be ‘why me?’ (in pranav tone :P) Apart from irritating me (by poking >.<), he is a really nice person… Ready to help in whichever possible way… All the best for future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Pranav, one of the most simple and innocent-faced (mind the word.."faced", he's not ) friends here in BITS Goa. He is most famous for the QODs he comes up with consciously or many-a-times involuntarily :P I would never forget the countless hours of fun I've had with the goan group laughing at his QODs... He is one with a fickle mind and extremely weird philosophies of life.. He loves troubling girls...(plz dont go on his looks here )..  One of his super powers is making out of context hilarious funny statements at any time of the day... and then the fun is compounded by the fact that he fails to realise what he just said... !!! Apart from all this.. he's a real good friend.. a very helpful polite guy.. he loves watching tv-series and reading about them on internet.. and god-forbid his curiosity is going to land him up in trouble in future :P He's a really good photographer.... His knowledge about cricket and football is vast.. and he takes games like fantasy team in world cup,etc much seriously than anyone else..and somehow I feel he's always going to be that baby-faced guy who loves irritating girls :P One more important fact about him is.. he's extremely determined person.. but somehow the laziness in him more often than not beats the determination.. sometimes even resulting in funny situations :P
All the best for future.. enjoy .. i know you will spread a lot of joys on this planet :D Stay in Touch :)

<p>He is tall and fair, has about the same built as I do. Some actually considered us blood brothers early at college. We share a creepily similar history which I will take some time to put  down. We both used to win Maths state level tests (albeit he usually topped them). We both were one of the few NTSE goan candidates (where I first met him properly). After that we  shared our coaching classes where again both of us were lauded for our Maths skills. We shared the same crushes too (problem, this one!). The similarities don't stop there. We both  passed out with almost same scores in every damn exam. Our CGs in BITS are also similar (though not great this time around :P ).  This is the statistics side of it. Even otherwise, more  often than not, our opinions on many subjects are the same. To the point where one can correctly guess what the other must've said. Taking all that into account, one can wonder why  anyone should bother writing a testimonial separately for each of us :P . There are many differences however but I will write the rest of this testimonial taking only him into picture.  Firstly, he is one of the calmest people in this world. I have NEVER seen him visibly angry at all. He has never raised his voice or swore at anyone, nor has he ever been rude. He is never impulsive and is level-headed, qualities that reflect in his other activities like driving or making plans. I really don't know  how he manages that. He does get naughty around girls and pokes them at his heart's content but he knows his limits. His room is very tidy for a hostel room and he maintains a high  level of personal hygiene (laudable considering our fellow comrades :P ) . He fancies Computer Networking a lot  and wants to make a career in it . He is really good at it. Chess and snooker are his favorite and he loves to keep tabs on football and cricket. We have been core members of the Dept of Photography and he is a dedicated member and photographer. Wont forget the really awesome time  we had playing so many multiplayer games in control rooms as well as hostels. He is also an addict of TV series. There are pretty high chances that he has watched every TV series airing right now on English  television (and many of them completely). He has received the infamous Mr QOD tag because he says something shocking, unintentionally,  which leaves people clutching their bellies. I believe that he is very mature, capable and under-rated although most people call him a kid. Girls are easily smitten by him and that's what I really envy :P Lastly I'd say I don't remember getting a 'no' from him for any request that I made. Hope we keep crossing paths like this in our journey ahead :D Best of luck !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>

THough hez fun loving most of the time,,he suddenly starts phodufying the subjects he likes and eventually will be tr8ed as a _/\_ in it.......even when it used to come to work in dept he used to follow it up sincerely as a core member at the same time used to have fun with otherz... The most amazing part is his room....... one of the cleanest room 1 ever found (inspite of he being lazy)..... He has really witty and any1 who is close till will definetly enjoy his company........
