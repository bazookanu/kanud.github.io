<h1 class="page-title">Pranay Agrawal</h1><p>Within a span of one year, he became one of the best friends i ever had in my BITS life. The brown headed "cute-ums" as we call him, he is an amazing sports person. He is fun to be with .The convener of a very successful fest , his dedication towards the festival inspired many, and he is one of the best persons i ever met.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>The asli tharak ka pujari, working with Pranay has been one of the most amazing experiences of my third year. Work wise, havent found a more like minded person in possibly the entire of BITS, and playwise only Facebook does justice to his skill(s). :P Superb all  rounder and the red haired sweet-ums of the campus (thanks to a bunch of CH4-ers)

<p>The so called Quark Convernor, the ultimate tharki ( WHERE IS MY GTUG TSHIRT!! ) , the brown headed CUTE-UMs as he became famous as :P .....he was not afraid to dream big n would always try to achieve those dreams......the guy is absent in most of the EG pracs n still gets the makeups for stupid reasons:D .....an amazing badminton player who is probably the best this campus has ever seen.....extremely coward infront of "spl" ppl :P ....good luck for the future and dream big :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/moheth-koppolu">Moheth Koppolu</a></p>
<p>I guess becoming the Convener of Quark , one of the largest college technical fests in the country says it all. Pranay has always been involved in a lot of extracurriculars from being a member of the college badminton team to being the organizer of one of the best GTUG meets in India.His work for this college has been exemplary and many of the juniors can learn from him. To sum it up I would like to say Pranay is a result oriented team leader always giving team members credit for successes achieved. He is always punctual, self-motivated with goals to pursuing positions of increasing responsibility and an effective communicator at all organizational levels. Wish you all the best man!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>

<p>Hmm ...PRANAY !!!  Kya kahu iske baare main .. ye toh ajooba hai !! :P Anyways .. you have been one of very good frnz from the first day on campus .. A guy from from the same class in the JEE coaching , a constant visitor in my college canteen , but still got to know him only on campus . A great sense of humor , a brown and empty headed individual , A great badminton player , and a great team worker can sum it all for u ..!!  He is extremely focussed on what he does and makes sure that everything gets done in time .. A great lover of carrom who plays some excellent fluke shots and expects accolades from me .. pathetic of him ..!  ;) We have been there for each other since the first day inspite of the many extrenal interferences and still managed to believe on each other at all stages .. I will remember all the time we killed in each other's rooms discuusing everything ..  from Carrom , Badminton ,Abhigyaan , Quark ,  Girls - rather the no of girls having a crush on u ..!! haha .. 
Spending the whole night designing the Tshirt for abhigyaan is an extremely \m/ one to remember . I wish you scale new heights in your carrer despite of knowing that you are in chemical engi..!!  . All the best for future stay the same frnd you have been all these days ..!!  :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
<p>I got to know him as a person only in my 3rd year when I was working alongside him for Quark. I still remember in our 1st year for Quark, he worked for Info-Man with a broken leg, such dedication is hard to find, seriously! Not to mention a great Badminton player, the best may be the campus has produced. I had both best and worst months with him and in a way all helped to understand him better than anyone else. He's like "one man army" can do lots of work simultaneously. A bit dreamy with ideas but efficient. He's extremely hard-working and passionate without any doubt and as being a convener for Quark he did extremely well. I wish him all the very best for a strong, happy and wealthy future ahead :D    <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>Pranay....to be honest he was the only person i knew who was coming to this campus from my school...and i was sort of relieved to know that atleast there would be someone I know....He is this red haired guy I first met in my tenth standard and has been a good friend of mine since then all the way along till now....The ultimate bindaas person I have ever met to whom nothing else matters and nothing else is as important as the work he loves to do...He is the kind of guy who can't be forced to do something which he wudnt wish to do... he is one who is very hard-working (or maybe I shud say workaholic)....has spent god knows how many sleepless nights in these three years doing all the work which we know he does to his best capabilities.....
As a great badminton player since a very young age...i am sure he has done all the people around him proud.....I still remember  the day when he broke his leg playing cricket (hero banne ka zyaada hi shok chadha hua tha)....n he was in the medC...he wudnt still stop playing around with people... 
There is this thing about him...he can charm people with his words quite undoubtedly and that's why can sound very convincing a number of times....guess some of these qualities in him made him an amazing Quark convener for our college. Pranay loves to dream big which is something I have rarely come across in many friends. 
Although he doesnot attend classes he is still greatly talked about by all our profs ;) Jokes apart!! His contributions to this college will always be remembered. I wish him great success in life and I hope that you will continue to remain a good friend as you have been all these years. Hope to stay in touch with you always. Cheers to our 6 year long friendship man!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Pranay bhaiyya....none of my juniors even call him 'bhaiyya', but I still can't address him as just 'Pranay', maybe out of some customary respect. He is a fun person to hang out with, always trying to pull someone's leg through his usual phrases, "kya paka raha hai", aka "kprh" and his usual words like "chindi", "lallu"..He's a great badminton player and of course, in frisbee...I admire his carefree (sometimes free=less. :-P) attitude and his dynamism in whatever he likes to do, be it, sports, studies, politics. :-P Best of luck for the future. :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>
<p>Mr. Convi ;)
Pranay bhaiyya, 
An extremely sporty chap, who can play badminton, can swim, run marathons and enjoy “Frizbee addiction”, it’s a real pleasure being a friend with you. A person with whom you can endlessly talk to and yet not get bored is what defines you ;)  
Made for food person, trust me Delhi would be a perfect place for you :P 
Awesome at work, you can organise everything:  GTUG, Quark, post Quark parties and the list goes on…
A great person at heart and a perfect organiser for a huge fest, I wish you all the very best for future and hope you achieve loadzzzzzzzzzzzz of success and happiness in whatever you do in life. Stay in touch :)

<p>Pranay Aggrawal.. everyone has already said about his tharak so won't be commenting  more on that... :P being the convener for the one of the biggest tech fest of india says it all about his dedication and hardwork.. under him i got to learn so much and i owe him for everything i am... a great badminton  and frisbee player... Someone who will be willing to anything to help his friends.. the days spend with you in the Quark room won't be forgotten.. the brown haired sweet little boy(as what some people from other side of the lawns call him :P)
Thanks for giving me an opportunity to work with you..it was an awesome experience :)
all the best for your future and may you achieve success in whatever you do in your life..
May we get a good pic together soon where none of us are beating each other up :) :P

<p> 'lal bal agarwal' sounds better than brown headed "cute-ums". So i ll also praise for the things that you deserves...convener of one of the best fest, awesome sportsman( badminton, frisbee, marathon and all) , political ability ;) . But more than all this he has a heart of gold. You can go to him with any problem, any issue he ll be there to be with you. An awesome designer , if one takes the responsibility gets it done whatever be the situations. Most of the times i am confused to call you 'bhaiya' or not, coz it goes too formal  for our friendship . A person who has supported me from the day 1 of the college and wish to have your support in all the upcoming years. I am not gonna wish you luck coz i m sure that if once you decide anything, you ll get it anyhow.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akhil-singh">Akhil Singh</a></p>

Anyway all the best for life , 1 sem hai we'll play together \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>
<p>Pranay ! If its not for you, Badminton would'nt be fun at all, very fortunate to have you in the same batch ! When I play with him, I run like hell from one corner to other while this ass just stands leisurely taking a foot or two once in a while :D! I'm a great admirer of your backhand man and backhand hand smash ( _/\_ ) always takes me by surprise. Baddy brought us close but Frisbee even closer ! He always goes deep (No wonder you are popular among girls), in the frisbee I mean :P. Outing was insane man and hoping for some more next sem. A very jovial guy, witty sense of humor with great leadership skills, Quark 2012 says it all ! I have always enjoyed playing with you man, be it baddy or ultimate. True sportsman in all respects and a great friend. Looking forward for some kickass game next sem. I know you will achieve big inspite of being in chemical :P. Cheers for all good times and a successful career ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anantaram-varatharajan">Anantaram Varatharajan</a></p>
