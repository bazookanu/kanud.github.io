<h1 class="page-title">Pranita Morisetty</h1><p>I have known Pranita for almost 5 years now. One of my best friends even before I came to BITS, she leaves me amazed me with her ability to work so hard and multitask. She is one of those people who work hard and party harder! She manages acads, Nirmaan work and her permanent “SOP” work so well, at the same time dancing away at DJ parties. The “Yo-star” is most popularly known for her “Lonely” song among many others :D Movie time with Pranita has always been interesting mainly because you are just waiting for her to fall asleep! Extremely helpful and good natured, she’ll always share her knowledge of any subject. A great friend, I will miss being able to walk into her room at any time. I am sure you will have a great future. All the best my dear!!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>

<p>Praneeta: Yoooo !!!!  The source of positivity , the possessor million dollar smile .. I can go on and on with these words. She has an appealing and inspiring aura which attracts me to her. I hold her so high for her positive and bindaas attitude. The frequent dances which we had in the corridor, the stupid jokes which I would crack and the way she would turn around and pull my cheek and give a lovely smile or rather an extremely cute grin..—all these are memories which shall always bring a smile on my face. Pranita is an extremely sharp, extremely sincere cute young girl who is so bindaas ,yet so hardworking( manages acads , Nirmaan and SOP so well, hats off to you!!).. that the first word which pops us for her is yo (ofcourse :P ) and the second is \m/ . Never change .. I am really gonna miss that chuckle of yours and the Sheldon like jokes of yours :P (Bazingaa)  . Hope you become a strong girl soon :)  All the best for your future. May you receive all you desire for . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>Pranita...how can I describe this girl without her epic pj’s, and her logics..only she could do that, no one on earth could even imagine how the hell she comes up with those logics..!! :O  Yeah,  of course ‘The Chi-Square’:P, in our every discussion chi-square has got something to do :D :D How can I forget nights we studied together? Some were scary though: P, all of a sudden she turns around and stares at me with those wide open eyes..omg!! that scares me to death!! :D I could never forget her eyes.
Well, every1 knows she is a rock star..!! :D Rocks away acads, nirman, sop, what not.. she is smart, sincere, hardworking, crazy though :P but has got lots of patience..!!  Pranita..you  are totally fabulous..!! All the best..for everything you want in ur life.. btw do remember me :D love you… :)

<p>Yo MSS! I have known her since the very first sem in campus. We used to do group study back then. We grew closer as time passed. Used to hang around in each other’s room for hours, doing apparently nothing. Will never forget the night we (mss, me, pooja, shruti) laughed so much that it is practically impossible to cross that limit. She was actually rolling on the floor!! It all started with me and pooja trying to chat with someone from her (pranita’s) account. Later on that person was so confused that we couldn’t stop laughing. And once we were in laughter mode, no one could stop us :D People passing by were giving us looks as to whats wrong with these people.. but never mind, we had the awesomest time! Another very memorable night (in 2-1) is the one with ganesh chaturthi painting! I was visiting her room just to see what she is up to, and seeing her do the painting, I had an urge to paint and I started doing the secondary painting part. It was great to see the completed artwork! She is a fond singer of “lonely” (one of her favourite songs)… Aptly named “Yo-star” by namrata! We lost touch in between because of her love for C-mess :P She CANNOT watch any movie at a stretch! (may have rare exceptions) She falls asleep by the time its intermission (I still don’t get it MSS, how can you sleep during a movie? :O) And yes, coming to her PJs… They are called Pranita Jokes! They are logical (effect of symbolic logic) jokes! She applies knowledge of every damn subject to day-to-day life, pretty much unnecessarily :P  btw she is an excellent motivator. I remember not feeling like studying for Chem2 compre and she had made me solve each question with her. Thanks to her I ended up getting B. She loves to have fun.. enjoys the DJs… Her working methodology is very unique. She manages to do everything (acads, nirmaan, artsndeco and of of course FUN :P) very well… We still have a semester to ‘rock’! Will make sure you learn to see full movie at a time before we leave ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>

Sometimes cant even understand her pjs with logics .applys CS every where , your  CS brain  \m/ . A very good dancer and singer .

<p>Crazy naani!!!!your gtalk profile...remember???Actually when i saw it i presumed that she has really gone crazy!!!Met you through nirmaan,came to know about you professionally through nirmann..but then after knowing about you personally, i felt its quite contrasting...so jovial, funny, and most of the times crazzy!!!!A C.S brain with most of the jokes in C.S language(combined with lahiri's intervention) used to make my brain fuse burn out!!!!i can say she is an apt competitor for kunjan in PJ's...  :P  ....But yaa...a wonderful person,great dancer,hardworking, smart and quite innovative.Fun to be with is what i can say about you...All the best Pranitha!!!!!wish you a great career ahead... :)   :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>Initially the memory space of our friendship was allocated in an array, but as days passed by and as the memories increased, we were forced to change the memory allocation to dynamic memory allocation, so as to allocate the dynamic and ever increasing memories. :P
She's the best person at cracking all the geeky-PJs...watever u say, she can relate it to any of her CDC and crack some stupid joke which ppl rarely understand. We used to hav our “geeky jokes” time in the "google buzz" in 3-1 :P :P. Thanks for tat so called "IS Brain" I used to have some company in NIRMAAN.
Apart from her obsession with Sakhi, Chi-Square; she's a really sweet, friendly, helpful and a totallly crazzyyyyy girl. I could never forget dancing with her during many DJ nights, especially the ACM one; superb dancer she is.
We had spent many of our best times working in NIRMAAN, she used to give the 360 degree thinking approach for each and every decision. The fun sessions and long talks we used to have, after the NIRMAAN meetings, are the most memorable moments. 
How can someone not talk about her brilliant coding??yeah!! she's one awesome coder i've seen on the campus...I could never figure it out how can she do it soo quickly...._/\_
I’m gonna miss all those times we spent talking, making fun of each other and giving hi-fi for some stupid jokes cracked by us!!!!Will miss u girl!!!

<p>MSS!!! .. Yo star … D Sheldon of our corridor … D best singer of “lonely” (better than akon :P) … Be it chemistry .. physics … math .. symbolic logic .. OB …  she is the only one who can apply these anywhere anytime … in her so called PJs :P … oh yeah not to forget the fattest person of our group ( that’s wad she thinks ) .. and a girl whu is very difficult to be woken up wen in sleep :P … This is pranita … one of the most fun loving persons I have met in BITS … I think I got to know her quite well when we went for music classes in 1st year together … Initially I did not find her funny and hilarious but gradually .. I think she realized the importance of applying engineering subjects to real situations … One of the very girls who can put up a smile even in the most difficult times. Even though her jokes r d most silliest of all  ..  I feel happy and nice around her always. Pinging unknown ppl in your room and you rolling on the floor till today are all unforgettable … :D. A person who is very organized in the way she studies … and one with very clear concepts … One of the few I liked to do combined studies with :P.  An excellent dancer .. (which she wont agree :P) .. who tried hard 2 make me dance .. but failed :P .. and an amazing painter … Pranita is very caring and will be ever ready to clear doubts. A very dedicated member of nirmaan who manages studies along with all other extra-curriculars. Keep entertaining ppl with your PJs .. :P and all the very best for your future endeavors ?  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pooja-anand">Pooja Anand</a></p>
<p>PM, Setty, “IS-brain”, “lonely”!
 Met Pranita in my 3rd year through Nirmaan. First impression: Sincere, frank, confident girl who can handle things. Very soon we brought her into the core team of Nirmaan and kept high hopes on her. And yes, she did not disappoint at all! Thanks to her commitment towards work!
Gradually, we interacted a lot and she became my sweet sister who does all sorts of crazy things in the world, hyper active at times and very very sad sometimes.. she has a lot of mood swings.. I remember a lot of moments when she is very sad and in no time she turns hyper active and happy! Ofcourse many a times the reason is chi-Square < :P >.  She has this “thanking-amea” which makes her thank people without any reason! I knew that she was a decent dancer with her performances during ugadi, but very recently got to know her singing capabilities also 1st with “lonely” and later the dedications to “chi-Sqaure”. 
Pranita has always been a special one for me this semester, whenever I talk to her she starts off with her stories of the day and super-stupid logics which only she can bring in. She can connect anything anything in the world with logic. The way she applies her CS subjects to crack stupid jokes is just amazing :P She can entertain you in many a ways and always tries to keep ppl happy around her. A very patient listener, she had to listen to a lot of stories from me even when she is not interested in those :D  She analyzes people well and behaves with them in a tailored way, which for me is the best part in her! 
A little more confidence, fearlessness and trust in whatever you do will take you to greater heights and you will be achieve your dreams very easily. Remember that I am always there for you, with you whenever you want some toast of philosophy or anything else :D All the times we spent together at BITS will be cherished forever! Sweet little sister! :-)
PS: Keep me in your cache memory and recollect the memories as many times as possible so that it doesn’t leave the cache at any moment, with whatever replacement algorithm you use ;)

<p>PM.. Though I knew about her before this yr, it was in third year that I really got to be her friend. She is charismatic, logical, determined and completely focused on whatever she does. She makes the best out of every opportunity and analyzes how one can contribute to each situation. Always gives valid points during any discussion, be it a serious Nirmaan issue or a random IS related stuff :D. She is a pro when it comes to managing time and yeah! a pro dancer too. :) . She knows how to keep a conversation going and to keep everyone around her entertained. We have spent a lot of moments together in Nirmaan, the routine discussions, ACM preparations, K-OPs related work and so on. Pranita, I admire the way how you handled all the difficult situations in Kops. I'll always cherish the moments we spend together, be it Nirmaan related or the treats and the trips and B'day Celebrations. I'm sorry that this is our last sem together. Hoping to meet you again and again after this sem also :D.  I'm sure you'll have a great life ahead. All the Best. Stay in touch. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
<p>Setty !! A veerryy unique girl. If u were "never stunned" by any logic, talk to this girl, u ll begin to wonder about the "sanity of logic" :P ! Trust me, no one on campus has made me feel "Oh my god\what the\:O\......." as much as this girl did. Almost Never understood wat ever I said and ended up replying "yuck" to many things I was expecting a good positive response ( >.< ), which changes to "Ooohh..." after I explain what I was saying twice ( :| ) ! Her eyes O.o ! 
Well, came to know each other well in 2nd year, thanks to Nirmaan. Had fun that time, then all ur crazy way of thinking and ur geeky jokes, never failed to AMAZE me ! I used to think, "how can any1 think like this" Had a lot of fun moments with u around, all the Nirmaan trips, evening walks and other trips we had. Ur ghost expression remember ? U really have catchy eyes, and that mole on ur eye lids add to it. ! :) Also, I definitely won't leave to mention ur "soo called secret" admiration to ****** ! :D , Ok, i ll call him Mr.C ! Trust me, I 've never seen any1 to ur extent, seriously girl, how much ?? The blushes, expressions, feelings u used to give, sometimes it was way too much ! :P Apart from all this, u still r studious, I remember u used to miss lunch for labs  ! :D There r soo many other things about u on which I can keep going on which made every1 think, "this girl !! :O" there just won't be end :P. Apart from everything, u r sweet and innocent in your own way and hey, how can i not mention the way u laugh, I must say, I really love it ! E1 this is unique about u :D ! Thers just no end to the list, is there ? :P With all this, u ll be one person I am gonna miss. It's been great, having known u. It's was a fun ride :)  
Just do wat u wanna do, achieve everything u want to, there s just no thinking back and u r one dedicated girl, keep in touch ! :)

<p>MSS that’s what I like to call her……..I know her right from my school….That time she was a proper nerd…:P..Very very particular about studies...She was my classmate in +2…hmm…I shud say benchmate and a close friend since then…. Then I was introduced to a totally different Pranita in BITS who enjoys life to its full extent, goes crazy crossing the limits :P…Jokes apart she is very kind hearted, very helpful you can expect her to be with you whenever you need any kind of help, sweet, Pro in cracking nerdy jokes which are called ”PM jokes” :P…, down to earth, friendly, very matured and jovial….very good dancer and singer also (The LONELY song ;)) …. A very good company to have fun and it turns out to be a blast when you are with her..Has some dushmani with movies; cannot complete a movie widout dozing off in between :P…..Yeah in +2 we used to go crazy for small small things (Writing sorry letters :P and laughing for Anu’s rajnikant style)…..She has special talent in cracking logical jokes which has a flavor of all the subjects she has studied till now and which are sometimes hard to understand also :P…..We worked together in NIRMAAN where we had the ultimate fun may it be any event or outings…..And how can I forget the ROFL nite in your room with Priyanka and Pooja….SOP is her the fav thing in these recent days :P…she is a diehard fan of Sheldon Cooper and I think got inspired from him for the nerdy jokes :P…She is a very good Marathi student of mine :)……I always run to her if I have any problem and need some suggestion and she will always be like my elder sister (though she is younger to me :P)……..We have one more sem together and I’m sure we will enjoy it to the fullest…..All the very best for your future and always rocking stay as your now :)!!

<p>Pichi Chelliiiii....!!!! That is what i call as soon as i enter my corri and its become sort of a routine for me.!! Settyy.. She is one girl who can make u hate your 

fav song or who can make u say."oh God.!! Please kill me.!! :P :D The girls who defined terms like LMS.. n who was the object for terms like Psleep :P She is one of 

her kind, actually only one in her kind :P :D n is characterized by her trademark laugh, obsession with sakhi n chi square and her IS brain..!! :P Every one here 

mentioned everything abt her.. leavin me noting much to mention abt.. Never thought that this girl would mean a lot..!! one of my bestest frns i've got here, who made 

my BITS Life so memorable.. though may be with her crazy acts, actually sometimes our crazy acts..!! :D Just 2 rooms apart, though now we spend most of the tym in 

either of our rooms if not for xms n assgns.. A very talented person.. be it singing, dancing, painting or studying.. and yea cracking PJs.. she does them all..!! 

Still Remember when i first saw u.. Actually my mom first talked with u.. n introduced u to me :P ur name was what caught my attention then.. As u share the name with 

my bro ( a lil modified :D) which i forgot to mention to u till recently :P n then gradually came to knw her.. In our first year.. The name Pranita used to bring to my 

memory songs from the movie Jeans.. Those were all she used to listen.. 24x7.. She had a very small playlist.. n neva used to deviate from it.. until i guess 3rd yr 

where she started to listen to other songs too..!! Thank GOD.!! :D u can give part of the credit to me :P N yea then she joined Nirmaan in 2nd yr.. n by the end of a 

sem, madamji almost became the head of her ops.!! This tells everything abt her dedication and her sincerity when it comes to work.. :) Everything about her is 

unique.! from the way she laughs to her stupidestttt logics.. Her excitement when she gets what she wants or rather sees what she wants to see. :P with such big round 

eyes.. almost jumping at times :P like a lil child..!! U really feel lyk doing anything fr her to see that.. though i neva mentioned it to u.. every moment i spent 

with u is wonderful.. The stupid discussions we have.. Trips. Bdays.. Yea wich reminds me.. Thanks for being my company on my bday :P :D singing songs aloud..!! 

watchin "Special" Videos..! :P movies.. which u sleep halfway through..!! Finally u watchd a movie other than sakhi with me completely :D n yea Sakhi reminds me of one 

more thing..!! ur similarity with the actress of that movie.. If u observe closely she looks like the actress in sakhi which she never agrees though.. and then her 

obsession with Palendromes.. her ID happens to be a palendrome.. (and ofcourse u knw wat.. :P ) Teasing You... I just love that..!! n sometimes how we get together in 

teasing others..!! Our paintings together in Arts n Deco and during Ganesh Chaturthi..! and studying in your room, wich later turns out to be another fun tym..!

ofcourse there is always SOP SOP SOP.. :D How we used to do SOP n COP in ur room.. nd how we used to sulk abt what our teachers said.. N how u cried aftr ur last SOP 

meet :P can neva frget it :P Having brain storming sessions abt Nirmaan. .or threatening u with the stupid things i wnt to do regdn chi sq... everything with u n me is 

fun.. the nyt walks, singing out aloud.. u trying to teach me dance.. wich turns out to be in vain.. but i get to see u dance.. :D and yea ur Lonely Song :D, both 

going hyper and just laughing and doing random crazy stuff.. every moment with u was precious n i just dont want them to end..!!! btw how can i forget.. ur logics..! 

though i hate to admit it.. the way u relate things to ur CS stuff is truly amazing..!!!! Cant believe all these times are coming to an end.. n that its time to bid 

thee farewell.. Though i havent met the standards of having the longest testi.. i guess a testimonial wudnt be enuf to describe our bonding... i had moments for a life 

time with u.. And dont wry i will never remove that pic of ours.. how can i??Its my fav pic with u..!! Shakespear am not.. to speak a lot.! but just a few words to 

say.. Forget me not.. (obviously copied :P ) nd i wud like to dedicate this song to u.. Na Chirunama nee hrudayana.. Koluvayunde.!! :D :D love u a loott setty

<p>The first memory i have of seeing MSS (:P) is in first year when someone pointed her out to me and said .."is she in first year? O.o"
Dat time she had that short haircut and it seriously looked like some school kid accidently came to BITS :P.
The next three years have revealed so many intersting and amazing facets of this girl! :)
A really really good person at heart and always ready to help out no matter what.
Serious at acads whenever necessary(has helped me out many times in those :P), has gr8 brains(seriously!) and a very chilled out person at the same time :)
I am really amazed at the kind of things she can say :P and of course the legendary PJs and dat out of the box roundabout thinking i witnessed so much wn preparing for shruti's bday's treasure hunt :P
And yes don't be fooled by her tiny size :P She can eat a lot and one of the few people i have seen with very regular eating-in-the-mess routine (which,lets just admit,is hard to maintain in campus esp when u r a goan and home food is nt far away ) Seriously respect that.
And yes, never knew the Mr. Lonely side she had either :P (i refer to her singing here :P )
One of the few people i knw dat i have heard can literally rofl :D,(sadly missed dat :( ), very sweet, dedicated to whatever she does, whther it was doing night-outs for completing a painting in arts and deco( oh yes, she can paint as well :)),or working really hard for making nirmaan what it is today, and a really cute(as u cn see frm her dp :P ),cool and crazy girl!
Always there to comfort you and cheer you up :)
Mss, all the best for your future !
Will miss you a lot!:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
