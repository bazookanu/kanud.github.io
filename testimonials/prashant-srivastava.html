<p>Hi prash the most loving and sweet boy of our group. I can still remember the day I complained to the senior about you and the times I gave hand to you.. :P You know how to manage the things properly but you think way too much over petty issues though. I hope your life is smooth after Bits too (you know what I'm referring to :D). I hope all your life would be happy and you would become successful in whatever you do and I can never forget you buddy.. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>prash u r the second person whom i first met in the campus.I remember the day wen i first met u wer i showed my attitude :).frm that day u became one of my best buddy :) u r an intelligent,lovable n most talented person.I like the way u plan ur things n the way u talk n convince others.a pro-gamer n sweet little boy(girls boy :P).U never give up things that easily.I remember the nites at NC(C mess :)),awesome bike n car(driver :P) rides we went,the midnite walk in mumbai streets,football fights wat else.I made u angry so many times sry fo that :) .I wish wat ever u dream it comes true.u will achieve great things in life I really miss u buddy :D one last thing bachelors party in las vegas :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/katta-rajesh">KATTA RAJESH</a></p>

<p>Yo codi!! I still cant remember our first meeting though you have showed me the whole scene :-/. As the time passed, somehow we got connected and i think your first impression on me had changed :P. You are friendly, cool, true lover and ambitious :). You just don't like to compromise for someone and i like it,keep it up. Your feelings towards others are way too extreme-likes to the heart or hates like hell. I think you should reconsider this habit in you. Anyway, i hope it does good to you :). From the beginning of our journey with GaN presentation in 2-1, you were there with me in every semester for these past two years(along with those other two beaches :D). The days we had during our preparations for exams, some of the best days of my BITS life :D. I feel sad as this is our last sem together. I wish you will get whatever you want in your life :). Wishing you all the best for your future and gonna miss you.
