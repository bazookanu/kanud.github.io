<h1 class="page-title">prashanth rao</h1><p>Chotu the first thing that comes to mind is movies, movies and movies. You have an incredible amount of knowledge about movies, politics and general topics. Extremely lovable person and I love the time I spend with you how many hours it might be or may be days or may be years. I came to know many things about the world through you and also you influenced me in many ways. Great fan of power star which also induced in me to some extent :P. You are the best in analyzing things and you are almost right in everything you say. I don't remember how we became close but I regret that I have missed you my first year. You have always been my side even though the mistake has been from my side, I owe you so much for this. I will miss you so much in the first sem and I believe later any ways we will be in touch.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>

<p>Rao or pottrao and me became acquainted and friends only in the third year. He was the Disciplinary committee student Representative (Though he has done certain questionable things :P) and in last semester he frequently had to attend its meeting. He did his job well. He is very good person and being around him always brings a smile to face. Hope you achieve great heights and succeed in whatever field you chose!!

<p>Rao, 
eee Rao eee Chinna Rao, (From the Video Remember :P)
You know it is said a person is lucky if they have a lott of friends. But in your Case it's the other way round , Ppl are lucky to be your friend, And i am happy that i am one of them.
For the unlucky Guys, He is a movie Fanatic, has an encyclopedia in his brain, Power Star ,sportsperson,Fan,open to new experiences, Cool headed, calm and composed and very very intelligent. There's no co-relation to the way he studies and the marks that he gets. His grasping power is tremendous. i respect you for that :) :). To him Responsibility is everythyn saw that in him as the Disco member. More than a true friend to me, Happy that i had such Fun tyms with you, But sad at the same tym that we did not get to hang out like this in the 1st year and that you leavin in the frst sem.  We share a lott of interests from tamil songss to Short Films (the Velma Factor,i guess :P ). Everyone has a dark side, But u CHotu have the purest heart of all. Never stain it and Just keep Smiling and Spread that contagious smile of yours  to all around you. STAY in TOuch :) . we have miles to go Ahead .. All the best for the very Bright Future :) .

<p>Rao..rao.. rao!!! The first thing that flashes in mind  when everyone thinks of  you is movies!!! But he is much more than that.Only a few know what he actually is.. .I awlays regard him as an encyclopedia of knowledge ;in  short he's a real maestro for me. Indeed the way he study stuns every one. His ability to grasp and analyse things are of completely diffrent level compared to others .He's a person from whom you have loads to learn !!! It was  always fun to spend time with him.Even the time doesnt know that its moving when he starts to speak about something , he's so gud at that...most of my lovable moments in bits were undoubtedly with him !! Have to admit what akshith said about being u'r friend...I am really lucky to have u as my best friend.The way you see things makes you different from others .I have never seen you doing anything in haste without giving a thought about it!! It had been a great experince spending time and having some really memorable experiences with you CHOTU-"one of my best freinds in the campus"...All the best for your bright future ..Keep smiling ..never loose that million dollar smile on your face!! Wishing you all the success in your life ...KK
