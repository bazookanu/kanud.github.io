title: Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad

<h1 class="page-title">Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad</h1><p>"Are kharach ka, testimonials lihaychet ka?" The typical Pagya question. "Kay mhanu me aata." Another trademark Pagya phrase. When I was introduced to Pagya in the first year, I heard of his reputation as being an extremely hard worker- hence the nickname Mr.Abhyaas! Pagya is an excellent coder, super gamer, mr. perfect, and holds a doctorate in sarcasm. He should start an elective Sarcasm C101. As good as that! Pagya is industrious and resourceful. He is extremely dedicated to his work. Meticulous and precise, he takes pain to make his work flawless.....Respect!!..... Closer to any deadline, he gets a bit fidgety, but that doesnt affect quality of his work.Or sarcasm. And he continues to evade the camera. The only time we managed to get decent photographs of him was the farewell. I still remember his nice little (Bond look) glasses that he wore during the conjunctivitis. All the best, Pagya. They need hard working people like you out there!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Well , I hope this won't turn out to be a page long testimonial. I have known Prathamesh ('Pagya ' aka 'Mo** '  aka parthamAHesh) right from my school days right through the +2 illustrious years of M.Prakash . I can confidently say that I have harassed pagya the most, mainly through my nicknames for him , 'Mr. Aabhyas' and a more recent one aka 'The Entra' , which have been quiet a rage. It is through these name that I will remember him always, and I am sure so will he. But pagya is the kind of guy who will take this in the right spirit, and be sporting enough to even joke about it. Pagya's life is scattered with academic achievements. He was our school topper (got around 40k ;-) ) , M.prakash topper, and also secured an IIT-JEE rank _/\_ . Besides academics , he is an extremely talented artist( must mention since he finished my workshop drawings) with A grade in elementary and an illustrious Arts N Deco career. In BITS I have got to know him even better as a person and as a friend. He is extremely diligent and hard-working . One can always rely on him to complete the assignments if he is in your group :P . His sarcasm can only be matched by Chandler and pagya-moma dialogues have been a great source of entertainment throughout college life . I especially remember his comment on kulkya's wall which forced him to forgo his 'photo  tagging' obsession . His food-packed room has a perennial canteen operational. The only thing that he is scared of is the camera , and lizards . Farewell might be the only time even his family has seen him in any photograph :D. Also , you will see him sporting his addidas \m/ pullover in case he is expecting to be near girls , especially 'pagya's item' . All in all , his friendly nature and hardworking attitude make him THE person to hang out with and also work with. Pagya will always be a very good friend throughout my life and I would also be his f(r)iend. Hope you achieve whatever you aim for, and NOT lose it on gambling!!! May God's hand be as big as yours when He showers you  with His blessings!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>
<p>The King of Sarcasm.(Even Charlie and Chandler can take a leaf out of his book ).I remember being bench partners in Kale classes and his jokes during the lunch breaks.Aptly named Mr.Abhyaas (by Sumant) for his dedication,motivation,perfection,hard work Pagya continues to excel in whatever he does.He is also an excellent gamer,skilled at drawing (I guess he drew all the figures in Sumants workshop reports) and a good carrom player.A man of his word he will always be there to help you.It is always refreshing after a dose of his witty one-liners.This talented,conscientious,diligent person will always be a "hot property" wherever he decides to work.In Pagya I have a great friend.All the very best wishes for the present and future.

<p>For the sake of a non-marathi speaking editor, 'Abhyas' is 'study' in marathi. Such an elegant nick name!!!!  ( but sumant will go in deepest hell for this ). I knew pagya since school days, and then in coaching class and continued in college as well ( we all took the same corridor) . Apart from all the qualities mentioned by people ( studious, hard-working, motivated, tension freak, etc etc) i would like to say that pagya is very very honest and loyal. He is also very generous at times ( he kinda stopped being so after he found out that all the people are so shameless about money matters :-P). He has always helped anyone who needed help. He has provided food to all of us with is ultimate food-stock. Like sumant troubled him with nick names, i might have troubled him with clicking pics and videos ( one while playing mafia _/\_ ) , but he always took it sportingly ( once he said he'll cut my hand, but i guess that was sarcasm ;-) ). He can actually win any dialog fight with his Sarcasm Sword and BigHand armor with anyone ( except mayb ameya..sorry pagya!!! he's just one level apart about this..mayb someday u'll catch up:-)  )  He is also a talented gamer and a superb coder. He can actually master anything with his extreme research and ultimate practice . Once we decided to go for a small trek on Sinhagad, and he practiced by climbing his apartment many times  :-)  (but important thing is that he was first to reach the top).  He is one person gifted with a warrior body but he prefers to be witty and smart rather than aggressive and strong . Working with him is the best!!!!!. His tensed attitude makes you focused plus the frequent comments make u laugh. He is one person who is what he shows he is...nothing in mind...all spoken and rest in sarcasm. Apart from all the qualities he is one of my best friends ( no sarcasm intended here) . All the best (awsm testimonial sumant :-D)!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-gote">Paritosh Gote</a></p>
<p>This guy is one of my fellow Fergussonians... (Junior College)... I have known him before we came across each other at BITS.. And what a surprise it was... One of the few friends that I happened to know before hand... :)... Pagya as he is rightly called by his friends is an awsome guy to hang out with... If you want a dose of sarcasm, surely you wanna turn to this guy.. He's mastered it very well.. :P... Pagya = Mr. Abhyaas is what I have heard all through my 3 years.. A sheer hard worker.. A total energetic person who gets all the energy to keep his ass stuck at his desk and study for continuously long hours... Thats why the name Mr. Abhyaas... Pagya = {'Abhyaas', 'Hard work', 'SARCASM', ' Pro Gamer', ' Sincere', 'Inspiration', 'Treasure of hilarious stories'. 'Fun to be with'} is how it is apt to describe him... One of those guys who put on a show at the right moment by the hilarious pack of jokes underneath... Or comes up with a hilarious incident that has happened and was witnessed by him... :) :P A true lover of art... An expert artist I must say... Coming to his academic side.. Always a person who never cribs about anything.. just does his work patiently and quietly... Very diligently though... A sheer hard worker.. If you want to know how to study, this guy it is.. surely he has got a lot of "TIPS" to tell and how it is to be done.. A completely passionate student he is.. !!! :P... Oh.. And he was my PS mate.. Had an awesome time together there watching movies, having the "Thermax tea of life", (Even the Chayvaala at Thermax knew us:P)... And also bragging about all that we do in the office to Karan and Sukriti... :P Oh..My.. they used to get so jealuse and fed up seeing how we led a all-play-and-no-work life....   Also torturing bash**r (The ps instructor)to go to SEED infotech.. and then to NIIT... Enjoyed totally..And how can I forget the report thing that we had made... It was so ridiculous... We did the entire project and report in 3 days I guess.. !!! Thanx to Pagya along with who bearing those fights of Aniket and Rachit. managed a splendid work .. :) . Also those "SEEDy" days...(Remember Pritam !!! :P) .  It was Epic to get to Seed from so faar on a bike in the morning at 6:30 with rains all over the head... :) Even had some awesome SEED moments like the one where we were told the answers to our final exams... I also would like to mention those "Bun-vada" and "Manmeet" days... :) and the fond memories of your Electronics faculty (Satpute and Joshi) of which you have told stories to all... !!! This guy is a person who is total workaholic.. You give him some work taking 30 hrs.. to do in a day.. And he comes and tells u its done within a day..... !! A person who is serious with everything when it comes to near the deadlines becomes a bit fidgety.. (I remember all the OS onlines :P.).. A calm and cool headed and a I-have-a-wide-smile types guy ... Comes up with his own creative dialogues and their Pagya-tones.... ("Kharach ka!!!" vagere.. ) sounds so different... A person who was also my jaundice buddy.. !! :P I can never forget how we have managed our 1st ever semester on campus... With t2 and compre together... :D Hats off to you... You are a true genius.. A sheer brilliance and dexterity.. A compassionate and loving friend... One of those who will not be forgotten till the world ends.. !!! Thanx for giving those awesome moments.. Cheers ... All the best in future... Have a bright career ahead.. as you always have had.. !!! Keep leaping ahead...!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>Abhyassss!!!!' Eternally sarcastic, forever hardworking, extremely brilliant. I have probably been the one who has tortured this guy the most (with the notable exception of Sumant :D) since coming to BITS. Most of the people above have written everything that I meant to, and some more... but no one wrote about Pagya's quality to speak about uncomfortable truths :D
I have never met anyone like this guy. Ever. I throughly enjoyed with Pagya/Abhyas at Thermax, dunno what we would have done without you :P
With Rachit and me in the group, it must have been a real pain x-D. I have to admit, it would be hard to survive PS1 without his dialouges, delivered with a cruel and perfect timing. I'll never forget all those times when I squeezed into his room when he wanted to study, just to piss him off :D. Well, that didn't work... nothing can stop prathamesh from studying. I am proud to have him as one of my best friends. Man, I am going to miss you in my hostel next year! 
All the very best to you mate!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>A mind needs books like a sword needs whetstone. Prathamesh needs both.
Prathamesh aka Pagya is one guy with whom there never can be a dull moment with. Perhaps the most sincere, witty, hard-working guy I know. Although he takes tension about many things in life he always ends up acing in everything he does. Prathamesh was the valedictorian of our school and he regrets that. Very few people would do that. People think that all he likes to study a lot .But that is a common misconception. A true gamer, tv series fanatic, anime lover and an excellent card player. Sarcasm in general is the language of pagya and it is legendary. He’s been my neighbor both on and off campus(almost) and things always have been fun.I know we will always keep in touch .
Best of luck for your future endeavors and I know you will get your dream job in facebook!

<p> Prathamesh "Abhyas" Gaikwad. One of the most hardworking person you will ever meet. When it comes to studies, he leaves no stones unturned. The dedication and commitment he has is a rare quality, be it the studies, projects or labs. The way you and Rachit used to fight during MT1 was hilarious though, and that brings me to the best part.The Sarcasm.Wow. The way in which he can take you down with his sarcasm and witty one-liners is mind blowing. And then there is a pro gamer hiding beneath all this. AOE,CS,DOTA, you name your deathwish. Pagya, I've had a great time with you, all the serious studies with EG, MT1(lol), DECO etc etc.., gappa tappa in the mess(ho, A mess) and what not. Hope you have a long tension-free, partly Rachit-free (:P) and successful life!
P.S. I still standby what I said about the curtain thing you do while studying.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>Rarely do you meet a person who thinks so much like you and you know you have made a freind for life.I still remember it was my first day in bits, i met this guy at lunch and after a quick small talk on why both of us didn't join the hallowed institute and chose to be here, knew he was not the narrow minded kind.Extremely friendly, he would always know when a freind needs help and never hesitates to help him.He excels at acads and can do so in anything he sets his mind to.A strong analytical mind coupled with sincere efforts makes him succeed with ease.He is very down-to-earth and his humility is admirable.He reminds me of a very good freind of mine in school which was probably why it took seconds to relate with him.With him you can talk openly and everything on your mind and his witty comments leaves you amused.Sincere all the best to you, have a great life.   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raunak-sharan">RAUNAK SHARAN</a></p>
<p>I started off thinking this guy is quite abnormal (:P) and now he’s one of my really good friends. An extremely hardworking person, he singlehandedly completed an entire part of our CN assignment. He’s great fun to work with also. He will get so tensed and it just gets funnier with all the comments and unintentional acting :P He’s really good at sarcasm and one of the few people I enjoy having verbal fights with (will really miss them). I am sure you will do great! All the best! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
