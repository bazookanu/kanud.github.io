<p>Li8 is what comes to mind when we talk about Prathamesh a.k.a "Baba"... he is one of those guys who takes everything li8... never attends lectures and even labs.. but has one of the sharpest brains i have ever seen... acads apart... he is a very kind hearted person... an awesome friend who never replies on gtalk :P is a huge Arsenal fan... and also had the privilege of watching many F1 races with him as he knows a lot about the sport... plays all sports with amazing skill... huge AOE fan.. I remember him playing all night long many times in the common room... came to know him better late in the 2nd year and still have countless precious memories with him thanks to our CDC's most of which we studied together and the CN assignments and the COA lab... his mind works great in designing the solution of any problem... the one thing I don't like about him is that he is always contended... he is a man of determination... I am sure you will do great in your life be it your business (yes.. the man actually owns a business) or a job or anything else because you only do what you like which is great!!.. Best of luck for your future and always remain in touch!!!  will miss you...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>Waghamode aka Baba …………… :) He is the one of the ultra li8est guys I have ever met in my life. Kuch tension hi nahi hai is bande ko !!!!!! A die-hard Arsenal and Alonso supporter, he has a superb knack for problem solving however difficult it might be. A very sharp mind, along with his carefree and jovial attitude is what makes him stand apart. When I got him as my lab partner in COA, I thought that now I have to do all by myself because tu toh labs li8 hi le leta hai … :P But then I realised how wrong I was. He is the one who used to tell me the logic for all those codes and I just typed them. And the latest one is the CN assignment, when Rahul, I and he pulled an all-nighter coding. Just be the way you are Waghamode …… All the best for your future endeavours and do keep in touch :) <br><br> P.S. - I love disturbing you and Rahul while you both are studying and I do it intentionally :P :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
