title: Pratik Hegde

<h1 class="page-title">Pratik Hegde</h1><p>Humility is the perfect word to describe this guy. What sets Pratik apart from the crowd is his warm nature along with his sense of humor. An avid Cricket and Bollywood fan, Sachin doing an item number would be an ideal fantasy of his. A great friend and an awesome singer and dancer, he has all the qualities for a movie star in the making. As the treasurer of the MM he managed to set the standard while managing acads equally well. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Hedgie... one of my closest friends on campus.As many would say he is the "shrimant" rich guy of our campus. This can be concluded from the enormous birthday treats he give.But what seperates him from the usually rich spoilt boys is that the word spoilt is not in his dictionary at all. He is the most humble person on the campus.Has good sense of humor too. Can mimic some people quite well. Hedgie u know who I m talking about. ;).. Cricket premi aaur bollywood fanatic aptly describe him. Maa kasam agar campus mein theatre hota toh har friday ye banda jaake wahan hindi movie dekhta :). Bollywood quiz winning partner. \m/..  Never the one to give hope,he gives others  a pleasure when he beats his arch enemy and his friend Sathe. :P..  Fingerd hurting so stopping the testimonial here.But one thing 1000 words wouldn't be enough to describe my one of best friends :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
<p>The guy with the quintessential "ear-to-ear" smile. One of the most humble persons I have met, he is a self-proclaimed Sachin fan. Versatile, (clear from his dancing talents) and film-star looks (clear from Rangaa's intermittent posts of his 10th and 12th standard pics) make him a complete package. A great guy who is indeed a friend in need, he takes to his acads diligently too and would ever be ready to entertain all doubts anyone might have. Have shared great lengthy funny conversations and times with him and only hope that our friendship bond only becomes stronger in the next sem that we have together.

<p>Humble. Smart. Amiable. Witty. This guy has got it all. A Marathi stud, huge cricket fan and a bollywood buff, he is also brilliant in acads, attending all classes and his notes serving as texts for whole batches! One of the most hardworking fellows I have ever met, he has absolutely no inhibitions and regularly takes parts in stuff like Dance, Singing etc.
My neighbour, whom I have tortured over the past 3 years with loud music he hates, he has been a faithful friend and been a great companion the past 3 years. Dude, Im gonna pester you in CH1 too :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Hegde Kaka! His displays an extra-ordinary amount of thoughtfulness and maturity-hence the kaka. A really warm hearted jovial person, always ready to help.I had the pleasure of working with him in MM-he is a talented dancer, actor, writer, co-ordinator, and above all, a friend! He is THE mathematician.You should just listen to Aniket talk about Pratik's sincerity and perseverance! Thank you Pratik, and All the Best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Hegde - Another chap who is always summoned by his surname... (Just like me :P)... HUGE SMILE is the most appropriate phrase to describe this guy... Has happiness flowing through his blood... Also this guy is the person on whose notes all the MSc. Maths students rely.. :P. Before the exams you can see any Maths person with Hegde's notes' xerox copy... :P.. Has the creativity to take down whatever is said in class in the neatest possible way... Very enthusiastic person always interested in whatever you say be it dance,drama, singing, dumb charades... anything absolutely and this guy always will be willing to do it... A cricket fan especially a Sachin fan from the bottom of the heart... An extremist of sincerity.. Attends all classes... even the most boring ones... He is a person who is very open minded and joyful... and is always willing to help everyone... (Except SATHE sometimes :P)... Also an awesome buddy to hang out with... (Gives treats when he tears SATHE apart :P) ... One of the wonderful friends that I made through Maharashtra Mandal...  Thanks a lot for being such a great friend ... I know you are gonna rock the future.. :)... All the best... !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>Pratik. mast.humble. He'll relax you no matter what you are going through. Apart from whenever he is not fodafying his T2, watches every fucking bollywood movie. aur cricket ka toh naam hi kaafi hai. He'll come running. One of the most sincere, warm persons I have ever come across.
Hope you do and go what u want :-)
ALL THE BEST!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>Hegde. Three words, simple, humble and hardworking. He is one of the nicest guys i have met on campus. An avid bollywood fan ( dude you should try your luck at that too :D), one of the first people who would come running with the bat to play cricket. I am yet to see a person who does not think highly of this guy. He id very warm and seldom gets hyper. I am a great fan of his bindass dance movies.  Wish you all the best for the future :)

<p>"The" person whose notes are referred by the all the MATHS students and if he continues to write notes like this (in his very good hand writing) even the faculty members will refer to them :P I personally enjoyed the debates (managers vs non-managers) between us. A nice person to share your feelings with. He has got a neutral way to look at things which I think will help him in his future... A person who bears the power of convincing....A person who is sincere....A person who lives his life fully. There is no point in mentioning his love for Cricket, Bollywood and BIG BOSS because that's an Axiom.
A good friend indeed...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Hegde is a fun person to hang out with! He's a die-hard bollywood movie freak and ardent Deepika Padukone fan (no one dares to argue with him on these! :P). He's addicted to (Indian) cricket too! The mention of his name always conjures up the image of his characteristic warm-hearted smile and him standing with his arms wide open to welcome you to spend some light and fun-filled moments from an otherwise busy (or even oppressive) daily life! You get to see his mature and generous side when you have him by side to help you during tough times. He has given me some real handy advice at times when my decisions faltered and I was facing the heat of emotional turmoils.He really is humble and loyal. That makes him 'the kaka'! He rocks the stage and acads alike and leaves no stone unturned to set and live up to his standards and he strives hard to raise it, all the while competing only with himself. That calls for wisdom and there he goes! His sense of balance is unparallelled and occasionally the stud in him makes a creative appearance (in myriad forms though)! :D
To his true friends, he is Lord Hegde! All hail!
Wish to see your name in cinemas sometimes ( :) ) and I wish you all the best with all you endeavours!
Will miss your wisdom and warmth big time!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Pratik. mast.humble.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>A die-hard cricket (Sachin and Mumbai Indians,  in particular)  and bollywood fan, I have hadsome memorable times with him betting on results of games. We both have had our share of success, haven't we? :P Bet placed on games has always amplified the fun. A very down to earth ever ready to help guy, is very very passionate about the game. The intensity he showed during the HPL is testimony to that :P. All the Maths guys would vouch for the fact that how indispensable his notes have been in their lives.A very neat and clean and organised man.

had some memorable movie discussions and DJ night dances with you :)

<p>This gem of person was one of the first friends I made in campus, may be it was because of the common language we shared. He is immensely passionate about cricket and has actually done a Project on DL method that is applied in cricket!! He always has been that hard wiring kind of a person. He also manages the finances for Maharashtra Mandal very well. The best quality of his - humility. Thanks Pratik for being the friend and human being that you are! Watching Cricket matches with you in Common room is what I am going to miss the most!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>Pratik is a guy with politeness, humility and simple living as his treasure, but that's not all, he is pretty cool, amusing person and yeah popular among gals too. No need to mention acads, that's for sure he is good at.  He's also a hard working guy. Best luck for future !!

<p>Hegde! Met him for the first time long before coming to BITS.It was in BITS though that I found a very dear and caring friend in him. Perhaps the most enthusiastic cricket fan I have ever seen. One of those few people who still follows IPL (rooting for MI wearing MI jersey and all!). A very good batsman himself (cant say the same about fielding though :P). Almost did a Ganguly like celebration after beating us in a gully cricket semifinal :D. Very good at acads (as I say outscoring Sathe is no mean feat). His notes are legendary-haven't seen notes as neat and comprehensive as his! Gives really awesome treats :P( that one in first year..it was a royal one!). An extremely sincere and honest friend. It was great knowing you :). Am sure he'll go places in life.
Long live and prosper! And yes, DO stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>
<p>Hegde... one of the best friends I have had on campus and someone who has helped me in this last year more than ne1. He is a very kind guy ... always with a smile on his face. He is called the 'typewriter' in our batch and rightly so. The whole of Msc Maths would have been helpless without him and his notes. He has been a strong member of MM. After kawley he is perhaps Sachin Tendulkar's biggest fan. He is someone who watches all IPL matches. Inspite of many suggestions he refuses to watch English movies and is a big fan of Bollywood. I will always remember the lavish treat he gave us on his 19th birthday in our first year. Thnx for all ur help in the past three year Hegde... All the best in life !!!

<p>yahan aap ke liye ek chota sa testi ...…:D :D…well Hegde had really tough time clearing my weird doubts about Hindi and also in helping me speak Hindi properly…as you see I’m still learning :D
Hegde is the 1st friend of mine, on the campus. I cherish the moments when u used to say “sit for 10 minutes na..u can study later” and the 10 minutes used to proceed for hours and hours with all the random talks. 
His craze for Bollywood movies and deepika padukone is unbeatable, I’ve never seen a guy like him who knows each and every minor details of every Bollywood movie, whichever generation it myt belong to.
He is one proactive person I’ve seen in the hostel…ryt from dance, quizzes, Pictionary, cricket….watever it myt be…Hegde always tried to contribute his best. He is a real fan of cricket, watches each and every match in the common room and plays cricket well too.
His class notes of any subject is like a reference book...they have each and every important in them…I remember the GAN notes….Hegde and his notes saved me from getting a poor grade in GAN. He is a really very hard working person.
As they say “it’s difficult to explain about the simplest things like love and god”…so is it difficult to say about Hegde or about my friendship with him.
I just want to tell you that I’ll be missing u a lot Haggu and I hate u for changing into CH-1!!!

PS: now forget the whole list of treats!!

<p>Hegde. Hedge. Typewriter. And what else can I call him ? The first thing that comes to my mind when I hear this name is a very very very sincere guy and very down to earth as well. A gem amongst friends. I've seldom seen people follow cricket so religiously. Be it the World Cup or IPL or the Hostel Premiere League, he would be ready to die for every ball. I remember when he almost got into a fight with Amit in the HPL when he got carried away with his victory :D He's my batchmate in Msc. Mathematcis and I can say that we'd all be doomed if this guy hadn't been writing, every single lecture ! :D Kudos to such sincerity. We've danced together during Ganesh Chaturthi culturals and Zephyr. Whatte experience it was ! :) And coming to the present, I seriously felt so sad for this guy when he got a room in AH6 when all of us were in CH1. But the scenario's changed now and he's joined the gang in CH1 ! Hi-5 :D My words aren't sufficient to describe the simplicity and goodwill this guy has. I'm so glad to be your friend Hegde :) Have a rocking future !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Hedge Boy ! One of the most cheerful people I have ever met. Has an ear-to-ear smile everytime I see him. Has the bragging rights to the fact that he was born on 1st April. He's also really gullible and there have been numerous times he's been conned into believing our far fetched stories (The one where Kawley slapped Paris). Very regular and tenacious, 2 qualities which are really lacking in myself. I admire you a lot for that. Has the ability to bounce back from the worst situations. From being to lowest in MOS T1 to topping T2 in MOS, Outscoring Sathe in Opre, Repeated the MOS story in Opti. Hats off man. Seriously. Here's to an awesome next year with you in CH-1. Ciao - Fungii

<p>Cricket, Bollywood, Management, and Maths CDCs are 4 inseparable entities of Hegde's life.   We have wonderful memories both on and off campus and he is one among those select few who I intend to be in touch with. Selfless, large-hearted and his down-to-earth attitude ( inspite of being a rich brat by which I am referring to his BMW :P) are the qualities which set him apart. His dedication and perseverence will take him a long way in life and I hope you are at the "achieving end" of all your dreams. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>Hedge, great fan of Cricket and Bollywood movies . But inspite of being a great cricket fan he always lost to me in betting . I really enjoyed being in a team with him in our hostel premier league . He is a great neighbour and he is always there to help you . And one thing that stands out in his personality his humble attitude. Hedge keep smiling and I wish a great life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tushar-mandar">Tushar Mandar</a></p>
<p>Pratik is one of the first few people i met on campus and is also one of the best friends i hav've ever had. he is very sociable, kind and a very helpful person.He is aslo a die hard cricket fan, whenever there is any India, or mumbai indians match, he is always in the common rooom wearing his MUMBAI INDIAN jersey.He is also a hard core bollywood fan. He is one one the few living being on earth who will readily watch hindi movies like Houseful 2 but cant watch LOTR,DARK KNIGHT,etc.Apart from that,he is a very focused individual,if he decides a target, he achieves it.For example, he has also achieved the miraculous feat of beating SATHE in MATH subjects!!!. I believe that with his sincerity, hardwork and intelligence he will definitely be very successful in his life.
