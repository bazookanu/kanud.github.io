<h1 class="page-title">Pratyay Pandey</h1><p>Pandey g, you're amazing sports person. Probably the only person to be good at both virtual and real games. Also, you're probably only person who watch tuts to play a PC game. _/\_.
I know you since my 1st year and it has been a great journey till now. I'll miss the talk we use to have about Nikunj.
Wish you success and great life in future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>He is someone who excels in whatever he does, be it academics or sports. He made those long, boring hours studying chemistry interesting, with his rather accurate mimicry of every professor('whaat re bhaba'!! and 'you write down first, you write down!) and his witty sense of humour.He is enthusiastic,smart and intelligent. A very good friend, amiable and someone who is ready to help always( I owe you one for opre!). wish you all the best for your future endeavors!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>

<p>yo PONday .. i didnot know him untill the chem cdc's . he always had that weird comedy villain of bhojpuri films look. but only when u get to know him can u understand how kul he is.. i always cherish ur smart way to crack the chem paper tips ,ur imitation of the prof's .. the jokes we shared in classes and the fun we had in CE labs .the gossip we had on benches and mongis on topics covering frm politics to bitching to nonsense .. i njoyed ur company and i admire ur care-free and happy-go-lucky attitude. i sincerely wish u enjoy watever u do and achieve watever u aim.. :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>Pratyay- I really didnt know him much before this sem. Only good thing about our CE labs is that I got all these good friends.
Working with you in those labs was really great, it was so much of fun with all your comments and most important your accurate mimicry
of professors "wrong worng wrong ", "re baba !!", "you dont come to class now i wont tell anything", "write down first".. and so many
Sometimes I really feel like its actually Koley Sir speaking.

Pratyay is really great person and a good friend. Brilliant at acads and always ready to help me out with mup :) Thanks alot for that.
I will always miss all your comments, mimicry, jokes and our group nescafe trips!!! 

I wish you good luck for you coming life :)
