<h1 class="page-title">Praveen Shreenivas Addagatla</h1><p>probably the other(than me) football fanatic of the hostel who loves and follows his club as passionately as me. A very gentle and humble guy. Always smiling and cheerful. Talking to you has always been a lite and smooth experience and a chance to watch a chelsea - liverpool match live at bridge or anfield  is gonna be a truly awesome experience. But we have something we can do on the 5th of next month in our hostel common room itself :)
All the best for your future mate. God Bless :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
