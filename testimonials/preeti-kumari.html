<p>Preeti is the life of our corridor. She is truly sweetness personified! I have never seen her get angry, say something bad about somebody or be rude to anyone. Funny, gregarious and smart, she can easily talk to anyone!  We have known each other since our 1st week of BITG life and since then our friendship has grown stronger and stronger. Remember the first day we met, how formally we were talking…things have changed so much... :)  Classes are never boring with you sitting next. You made my dreadfully boring maths-1 and spm classes bearable. I wish we had more classes together.
She is the type of person one can trust blindly. Her pampering, loving nature is truly unique which radiates happiness everywhere. Very practical and straight-forward, she is the only girl who has never faced an argument with anyone.  She loves listening to songs…and will generally use her earphone (at its highest volume) which ultimately leads us banging her door like crazy people.  A kid at heart, she loves going to cp and swinging as high as possible. Very sincere and hardworking, a few days before xam one can always see her in library. An ardent harry potter fan, there are harry potter posters everywhere in her room. (:P)
All the best for your cdc’s next sem ….plzz do keep in touch and wish you all d best for your future endeavours...keep rocking...:)

<p>Preeti.. Somehow words fail me at this point.. and I fall back into the memories of long walks with a cup of coffee and long long discussions.. That is something which I will miss the most.. You are perhaps the one who though so different is so so alike to me.. we strangely share the same opinion over many things.. n also the amazing space we have for each other.. .. I can actually sit and thank you for every moment you stood beside me.. n helped me grow  from a peevish Mamma’s girl .Now since I can keep filling in these memories.. let me move on to something more important.. Life often gives us some wonderful gift.. something which is soo close to our heart.. and for me you are one of those . Will always cherish every moment with you… and this is not flattering or buttering.. you are one of the best people I have met.. Your passion for what you like is really wonderful. .. your carefree yet conscious attitude has initially bewildered and later amused me a lot.. If there are things which Almightly makes as his finest art, you are one of them. Though you don’t believe in his miracles much, may he always bring a smile on your face with those.  All the best for your future..n always stay in touch. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>Pretty Preeti.... yes, you are.... innocent, cute and pretty face, loving heart, hard-working, fun-loving, how can god give you everything..... I am jealous... jokes apart... my most caring and sharing friend, my best friend, nervous and yet consoling who was there with me, every time. My journey in BITS reminds me of you, having same lectures in 1-1 and 1-2, those EG nights, thermo and physics nightmares, you were always there. I remind of you, and I find a glint in my eye, you know.. You make me feel, I have earned something really precious. Your alarms, the way you walk, the way you get conscious, your face while you laugh, you get irritated and our LCD talks (:P), I am going to miss it all. You are most adorable person of our group, corridor. You have to talk something, go to preeti, want to eat something , preeti is there. Remember, all those long talks, we had during EG time, brings a smile even to your face right... then our group-meetings in your room and nonsense-stupid things, we used to do. Dedicated towards studies with Try &Try again attitude, you were an inspiration for me. Integral member of BITSAA, DoPY, you manage your co-curricular also pretty well. Now even you will be irritated the number of times I have used Pretty, but that’s the word that defines you. One thing i will really want to tell you is that, during 2-1 diwali, when only me and shweta were here, I really missed you a lot when you were not with me for 3 days, as if my soul was missing, thanks to you, we both still had a great Diwali at your home.... and now comes here these days, when we won’t be living together, not able to see each other for months, I am hating this, I can’t imagine myself not listening to your alarm in the morning, not seeing you... Endless fights, cute moments, caring, soothing and lovely moments... we had it all, but there are many more to come... please please please... be the same.... and don’t get conscious about your nose.. :P... Love you yaar...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>I can't stop Sakshi from telling about you all day long!! One of the sweetest character I have ever seen...pretty nervous (wo IC wala incident) but a really really sweet person to talk to...All d best for your life ahead! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yash-sinha">Yash Sinha</a></p>
<p>Sweet is the first word that comes into my head when I think of her. Ask her for any favour, she does it willingly without sulking a bit. She tends to be in her own world sometimes (well...I could be wrong about that :P). She has a rare quality that when you are with her, you are comfortable even without talking. There's no pressure to say something if you have nothing to say. She was made my PS tolerable for me. It would have been hell if not for her. The aimless strolls during lunch time, trying to look for some new places to eat, looking harder for places where they gave rotis, chaat at Ananda Bhavan and that huge narial paani we had is what made the entire thing pleasant. She has a lot of patience when it comes to putting up with people. The other day we went to a mall and I bragged the entire time about how I couldn't find a decent fitting pair of jeans until I found one after long hours of search. I really owe you one for bearing with me that day :P. It is a task to wake her up. But somehow she makes it a point to attend every class, including the 8 o'clock classes even if she wakes up at 7:55. She's hard working and sincere. I really look forward to share classes with you next year. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-yegnamurthy">Neha Yegnamurthy</a></p>

<p>Pretty Preeti !! Preeti is lyk a bundle of happiness rolled into 1 person. She brings her own sunshine whrever she goes.Optimism personified.I love this about her... she manages to find that 1 silver lining in any situation..n she'll show u too.. if u just hear closely for some words of wisdom given by her from time to time :P. She alwayz has something interesting to talk about... our dinner time wouldn't have been so spicy widout her...A very caring person...makes sure everyone around her is as happy as her :). An altruist at heart...preeti is a friend who would go with you till the end. Her ingenuousness inspires me and i guess that's what makes her personality as magnetic as it is. I love the way she gets excited about some particular types of food(sweets/chana/fried papad :P) so all of u guys who wanna win her heart..make sure u gift her a box of gulab jamuns :P. I have alwayz enjoyed your company Preeti... Our corridor would have been hugely n sadly different without u. Looking forward to many more of your interesting stories when I come back after PS :)...Do great...I no u will !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/niharika-tiwari-">Niharika Tiwari </a></p>

<p>Preeti or should I call you peetuuuuu :-* !! You are someone who knows me so very well ! Someone who can be relied on completely..!! We have been friends from the past 3 yrs but the last two years have actually increased the gravity of our friendship !! She is a who is absolutely crazy and restless.. :P A die hard sweet fan.. but beware!!! When it comes to sharing.. she will straight away say NO with an evil grin on her face.. !! :P But later on she will be sweet and say "Le le yar" !! ;) A girl who when asked to stop shaking her legs in the class hardly pays attention.. and just keeps on going her way..!! An independent girl who knows what decisions to take where.. :) !! A girl who cares for her friends !! A pretty face with a wonderful smile... she has her own charm..!! If you start praising her she gets all consious.. :) She can be an entertainer throughout with her cute little idiotic ideas.. :P She is very particular about food...!! Won't eat at all if she does not like it !! Hardly adjusts on that ! ;) She is extremely good at heart..!! We have had such memorable moments together.. each one has been a new experience in it's own..!! You can talk nonstop with her (especially me :P ) on any random topic "under the sun" ;) :P and you won't even realize how easily the time has lapsed ! One more thing... Caution : When she is listening to music with earphones in her room... don't knock at her door.... instead bang it hard..!! Because she won't open..!! :|:P I remember going to palolem in the bus.. :P My first bus experience.. and there she was taking care of me all the way long...!! She might look kiddish but she is extremely mature..!! :D A type for whom early to bed and early to rise never ever will make sense... :P I loved the expressions you used to give me during bio lectures about how you just hated it.. and me grinning at the same.. :P Passion for photos is one huge thing we have in common..kahin 
bhi kabhi bhi we click photos..!! I love you loads peetuuu... take care.. and be the way you are..!! I wish you all the very best for a bright future ahead..!! :) :-* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>
