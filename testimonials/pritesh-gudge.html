<h1 class="page-title">Pritesh Gudge</h1><p>Oh.. Its an extremely difficult task to write about this guy... Where do I start… With his unique sense of talk and laughter this guy has won hearts of many…A person who has a heart of a lion and is as gentle as a dove... An extremely hardworking, dexterous guy.. Totally works his ass out… A person who lives upto his dreams… And a person whose aim in life is to own a farm, sit there drinking tea and enjoy the beautiful climate and the nature’s divine beauty… :P.. That’s how he wants life to be like totally relaxed… He is that kind of a person who wishes that “If only there were 35 hours in a day”…An extremely intelligent chap and along with this intelligence has a huge bag of sincerity which makes him a complete package… An inspiration to all… A perfectionist at what he does… Whatever he likes is for sure mastered by him…. A spectacular devotion towards coding this man has… Go to his room any time of the day or night, you find his terminal open and some tests running on it... some graphs being plotted… some kindof weird output being generated which only this guy can understand…. A totally unique kind of category he has made… And this category can have no one other but himself..  A very sincere guy who Attends (or rather sleeps :P) in all classes… A man who is very true to his principles and has a defined set of rules regarding how to live a happy life.. .:P  That’s Pritesh Gudge for you… !!!
 A total  Tea addict and can be a contestant for a Guinness World record for “The person who has had the most number of cups of tea in a day”…. My my… how much does he spend on Tea for a week!! ….go in his room and you find him sitting with his tea cup in his hand… or pouring water out of the kettle to make tea… This is the scene always…  A person who has food always at his room… Thanks to those big parcels that are received every 15 days from his parents… What not do these parcels contain… Snacks, lot of snacks, lots and lots of snacks, any type of snacks… Another parcel which contains fruits ranging from 25-30 apples, 2-3 dozens of bananas, watermelons, kiwis, pomegranates, and what not…. You  will find any fruit or any biscuit or any type of snack at his room….( Whenever you are hungry go to his room .. you’ll get lots to feast on :P)
A person who is extremely dedicated to academics… Has a treasure-chest full of knowledge on any subjects… (In many case know way better than the prof :P) You see him teaching stuff around during exams… People crowding his room for getting their doubts solved… He helps them all … Has a clear understanding of any damn thing possible… unless and until he understands it and is satisfied, he never leaves a topic apart…. What a wonderful helper he is!!!… Will never say No to anything…. You ask him for anything and there he is… right from cleaning your fan, packing stuff, etc… 
I know this has been kind of huge testimonial… But this guy is so hard to describe that even the above words do not describe him completely… Anyways.. whatever it is… I am highly grateful to have you as my friend… No one needs to tell you that you will excel in your future blah blah…. Its all understood… Keep it up… !!! Soar high beyond the skies…. 
PS : Thank you for sparing your precious time to read this …

<p>I didn't know him when I was allotted a mentor named Gudge, in the initial months of a department called DoSM. Got to know a lot about him in Waves 2010, when he taught me the work. It was amazing. I have never seen such a dedicated, focused person like Gudge ever.  From the early mornings at 4 am when we used to put up banners to times in Library when I used to study with him, to get some sort of inspiration. 
Not to forget the famous dance for which the juniors especially used to call him, surely will miss him in all DJ nites as well. 
One of the best guys I have met in my campus life, Pritesh Gudge. We ll definitely miss you. :)

cheers

<p>You know that I don't have to say anything. As Harry and Sally say "Its already out there". Just that if there is anyone who can get closest to "This is John Galt speaking..." then its you. Thanks darling for everything. We have a long way to go together. :'-) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Gudge Gudge Gudge.... hmmmmm.... definitely not a human being.... perhaps a phenomenon , some might call him mad, some will say workaholic some will say intimidating and blah blah blah... But the people who actually know him wont say anything..... coz he leaves you speechless.He isnt a workaholic, he just loves whatever he does and will finish it off in the best possible way, the commitment , the dedication, the passion that he carries along make me realize the limitations of my vocabulary. I met him during my first year waves, he was working his ass off dat day and he's doing the same till now. You will always learn something whenever he's around, u'll always have fun. The fun that we had on all the DJ nights was amazing :D, dancing like mad idiots till our feet stop responding to the impulse from our brains den dropping down and again pickin ourselves up in less dan a minute . He taught me not to give a shit about anyone, if u love something then just do it." Good boy toh mai poori zindagi thha, thodi der ke liye naughty boy ban ne do" _/\_ _/\_ _/\_
Live life as if it was your last day, keep the child alive inside u  ;)
Some people think he is immature but i feel he is one of the most mature person around, he knows how things work in life, whatever he does can never hurt anyone, he is always ready to help even a stranger willing to compromise even his own interest.I wont comment on his academic capabilities, i can't, he just belongs to a different league.But that isnt his USP, that'll be the caring and compassionate heart dat he has beneath that ogre like body . You always feel a sense of achievement when you have someone who will always be there for you no matter what happens.
Having people like him around you makes you feel special about yourself.
So you bastard son of a bitch!!!! Keep the Wild MADNESS alive forever, i'll never forget the epic fun we have had throughout :')<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhiraj-tomar">Abhiraj Tomar</a></p>
<p>Gudge is a very different person. His deeds speak louder than his words (metaphorically, for he has a booming voice) He is a very dedicated person with the hindi movie "Jahannum tak peecha karunga" style. In the first year,we would refer to him as "The Army", because he has the gait and sturdiness of a T-90 tank. Then he has this distinct kite-flying action when asked about an exam. We had a most wonderful time with him at SKF, with him being either an hour too early or an hour too late at the bus-stop. 'Fatigue' is a word not known to him. He can do enough work to kill two ordinary people, and not even break a drop of sweat. Whenever there's music around, with everyone dancing, Gudge is in a world of his own, almost in a trance, like a zombie.He is the guy who can do anything...simply anything..All the best, dadda!! Have a most successful future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Me:"why do you study so much?" Gudge:" I don't want my present actions to affect my tomorrow."... this is a part from one of the uncountable discussions I have had with him. Haven't seen a person so focused as him at such an age. Gudge encapsulates among himself a dozen characters. He is smart, witty, hard working, charismatic and at the same time crazy, maniac and gay :P. A lot of people say a lot, boast a lot, make false promises but if there is one person who epitomizes "better done than said" is definitely Gudge. Thank you for adding to the awesomeness in my and many other lives. Wishing you success in all your endeavors. Cheers bro!!!!!!!!!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Gudge! There are some names you just have to write first to get a "feel". I'm sure Gudge knows what I mean. At first I thought you were a nerdy 9p guy, who did nothing else. Then I thought you were a big big loudmouth. And you're both! But much more. I've learnt so much from you. How can anyone not admire how dedicated you are. There's always that passion in you. 24/7. I don't know how you keep it going, but it's amazing.  Whatever you do, you give everything to it. But enough about work. Let's talk of your maniac side. The guy who dances in every DJ nite like it's the last night before apocalypse. The guy who shouts across the entire campus, to hear it echo back. I don't know why you do it, but it's sure as hell fun. I've learnt to be crazy from you.  More than that, you've always been there to help me out. Won't forget the great fun I had with you. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Life, magic, friendship, enthusiasm.......and many more words are alive because of some very few people.....GODGE best of them. I think Oxford should assign “Pritesh Gudge” as a synonym to DEDICATION. His passion for life and commitment to things he love sets me speechless and I guess that would be the reaction of all who know him. The crazy DJ night dances, crazy singing nights, crazy trips to Bogmalo, crazy treats, crazy ass kicking sessions , crazy DoSM banner nights, crazy Assignments , crazy Classroom gestures in short….CRAZINESS REDEFINED. I know many of you might find him intimidating or a big time nerd but what Pritesh Gudge truly is…..he is the most generous and helpful brother I have…kind of like those Kings whose glory we read in History books. This guy would never say no to a person asking for help. The guy makes fun of his problems and solves them with full dedication which makes him much more mature than 90% of the campus. Smile....that of a kid with pure heart who still believes in magic.......I want to tell you friend you are Magic. There are many who comes to me telling me “kaisa h yaar ye isko badal”.....I want to tell you dude be what you are because by being what you are you give this world what it actually needs......people with pure and caring heart who are mad to live, mad to talk, desirous of everything at the same time and courageous enough to stand any changes. Thanks for being there for me bro....luking forward to a legendary end sem trip..... I’ll surely miss you in my next sem......Love you too bhai….being with you makes one realize how wonderful and amazing life is.....saala sab zindagi kaat rahe h.....kuch hum jaise hi toh h jo ji rahe h :D
Cheers to this wonderful BITS life and our friendship.....!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-mathur">Rahul Mathur</a></p>
<p>Datye’s testimonial pretty much covers everything you need to know about this guy… But still I’d like to express my characterization of Pritesh Gudge. His passion for learning is awe-inspiring. Once he decides to do something, he puts his heart and soul into it. He is intelligent and hardworking – a combination which makes him an ideal student. He lives on his own terms, doesn’t care about what others think of him. His ideology – “You should be so content and happy that the person in front of you feels like crying.”  A kind of guy who will go out his way to help all those who matter to him.  I can’t thank him enough for the countless occasions when he lent me a helping hand. A role model for me. I wish you all the success in the world.

<p>Pritish _/\_ ..the general gesture we give each other when we pass by..But actually it got so engrained with your personality that .._/\_ ==GUDGE . First Year when i would see him striding across the library ..i would get scared of his gait . Then gradually in 2-1 when he would discuss Maths questions..i would initially be scared n gradually curious..curious about the fact that how can any one be soo happy in life... Whether it be the DoSM work..or whether it be his acads (which he fodufies so well) or his passion for his project ...I have always seen a content on his face.. How can anyone slog so much..and still enjoy life!!!  .. Vocation and Vacation are one and the same for this fellow...A very very dedicated student , a passionate coder ,a helping friend ( I still remember asking you questions..n u would explain the whole thing..nothing would get in and then you would take a sigh and start explaining all over again :P )  and above all a great human being..Huge respect for this guy... Our long discussions in library about the segmentation faults in the OS codes , the RPJ talks , the talks about you owning a farm in future , about your Thesis topic or The FountainHead discussion ..Atlas Shrugged suggestions..or listening to all my stupid cribbing about Opti n Numal grades  (silently nodding ..with a total serious look on your face :P ) -- I cannot believe I actually talked so much to an alien--ya u actually are one... No limitations, which Human beings like me possess, can hinder your way..you gotta go a long way... and you will keep inspiring humans like me.. with your passion ,intellect,dedication ,slogging and yet a smile of content... Feels sad to realise that the last sem with this magnificient personality is over .. Stay in touch n keep inspiring :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>Gudge sahaab! Maine aisa kya keh diya aap se ki aap toh bas library ke deewane hogaye! You always said you got the keeda from me, but I did not know that I influenced you to such an extent! Though, I must confess, I am secretly proud about it, if that was what it took for you to become THE Gudge. :D But kabhi kabhi tu bahut zyada tension leta hai. Itna mat le. Hum hai na. You should let your seniors take the tension and just simply ask them later on. That is what we are for, isn’t it?! 
Though, I must say, I really admire your dedication and will power to do well and sit for hours at a stretch with a set target and determination to achieve what you want. This will really take you a long way in life. 
I noticed this aspect when you single handedly took over the most important task of banner display during the festivals. In my time, I was able to handle so many other things just because this one major task – which is what brings us the sponsors – was taken care of and in a very efficient and systematic way. 
It is brilliant to discuss the whole aspect of ‘Life’ with you. And it really is amazing to see your point of view on it, which does make a lot of sense logically and is brilliant advice to incorporate in one’s own lifestyle. 
I have learnt a lot from you. Keep up your zest and spirit of life and all the very best for all the obstacles ahead. Don’t worry too much, things will work out extremely well for you.
Cheers!
P.S. It is not very easy to put everything into words for all of you. Some things are just special and are best kept to one’s self.  All the times spent together is something which I will always cherish. It is a basket of memories which I take with me. Thank you for being a part of it. --- Madhu Singh<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>He is one guy i used to admire from a distance in my first year in college. I got to know him better during the net-tech days in the 2nd year. Though I was almost nothing in the assignments given to us he never complained and always smiled and did whatever i asked of him. He's  a very passionate guy, it shows in the way he carries himself. Be it dancing in the dj nite, laughing out so loud in the mess that everyone stares at you or slogging it out in the library. Determination should be his middle name, he aces every course that he likes and takes out time for other activities too. I remember once seeing him in waves, while other juniors were sitting around idle , this guy was running from pillar to post all sweaty getting things done and still somehow managing to enjoy it. From what i have come to know you in the 3 years i know for a fact that you will go miles in life. Cheers...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>Pritesh is most THE inspiring person I have ever met! He is so extremely dedicated and always happy to work. I had heard tales about him working continuously for 48 hours without sleeping for 1 particular Waves and after seeing him at SKF I realised how much he loves to work :P Never have I seen him down about anything. He is the one by whom standards are measured in our batch so much so that if he tried and couldn’t complete a task, it is declared impossible. He is quite straightforward and can speak anything to anyone (e.g. Basheer :P). Thanx for making SKF more memorable! All the best for the future! I am sure you will do great!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>Pritesh Gudge the other name of Dedication and Hard Working . If any work is to be done by next week that it will be done by today this is the motto of Pritesh Gudge. Whatever he thinks about you, he will have it on his face, whether you like it or not!. He is a great friend who is always there for you whenever you need him. I really feel lucky to be friends eith him .This library Kidaa has been a great inspiration to me and  I am surely going to miss him.  All the best for your life ahead .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tushar-mandar">Tushar Mandar</a></p>
<p>Pritesh! Who doesn’t know this guy! He is in very true sense a synonym of DEDICATION. The first encounter of his dedication was for the Lezhim performance. He used to be so punctual and sincere for the practices! He would come to LT1/2 lawns sharp at 9 and start practicing alone. And he would do it continuously till 11 pm. The way he said (rather screamed) ‘CHANGE’ to synchronize the performance can never be forgotten (it is actually audilble in the video!) The next is his DoSM work. He used to be with his laptop everywhere in 2-1, doing some or the other DoSM work. And last but not the least (among I know) is acads. Library keeda award testifies that. (though he studied in room this semester) He studies with so much of concentration that he almost jumps out of his chair in shock when you call him. I can only respect him for the amount of dedication that he shows for everything that he does. He is least bothered about what others think, does what he wants to. That’s really great attitude towards life. And yes how can I forget.. The way he says “Arre Datye...” No one can match his level at that! He is clearly audible in my room when he shouts that in front of AH5. Whatevr it is, he enjoys life his way. Keep doing that.. :) Best wishes for your future.. :) (now dnt ask y r u smiling :P He somehow has a problem with me smiling all the time)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
