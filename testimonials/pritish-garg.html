<p>Typical dilli ka ladka. Always fun to be around him, and especially when he says "controversial" statements with an air of obviousness. Always li8 and good natured, and ready to help anyone out.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>

<p>I had noticed him on campus...here and there....but then I got to know him better during 2nd year DOCW days. Will always cherish the great times we had together...a very warm and genuine person, very friendly and helpful.  Kaafi charming banda hai...shy bhi hai...especially ladkiyonke maamle mein.. :P It was great to have known you...and will definitely miss you Pritish!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/fatima-dilruba">Fatima Dilruba</a></p>
<p>You are a gr8 person to hang around with. Koi bhi tension ho, pritish ke room jaao, and everything will be back to normal. Nothing has to be said about your leadership skills, we all got to see it during zephyr, when out of nowhere, you made the entire hostel participate and win the trophy. The one thing I will cherish forever is our hindi movie discussions, you are perhaps a bigger bollywood fan than anyone else in our hostel. An epic walking style and an even more epic talking style, you will always be remembered as one who enjoys his life to the fullest. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Our great Hosel Rep :). The King of Quotes. He's the guy who speaks the truth on face (jis ko jo sochna hai soche :P). The guy who likes to raise up the controversial issues & will then opt the midway being diplomatic. A very jolly person though. Always greedy for likes on facebook :D. Had so much fun with him in aoe sessions & mess chats. Will always cherish those moments. Have a great life ahead Pritish !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>One of the first friends on campus. A really good person and friend, very helpful. Great hostel rep, he made us participate  when no one wanted to and actually win it. A real movie buff will not stop watching new trailers and releases even if it is the night before a compre exam. Will always be remembered for his quips and gyaan that he doled out in the mess :D Hope you go  long way in life,.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>I don't know whether he remembers it or not but Pritish was the very first guy who ever came to my room. I still can recall the "mathris" that we had in my room on our first day of BITs while discussing how each one of us landed here. Overall he's a very nice guy to have around at all times. His inimitable gait and his witty sarcasm will never fail to lighten the mood anytime. Though he may sound blunt and cold sometimes, yet he is one of the most understanding persons to have as a friend. He's a good leader and someone who can mingle with almost everyone and fit into any random conversation going on. His self-proclaimed "swash-buckling" style is pretty apparent and he is one who knows how to really enjoy life. All the best for the future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Pritish is among the first friends I made here. A lively guy who goes through everything and still manages to smile and put a smile on someone else's face. He is the happy-go-lucky person everyone wants to be at some time. During most of our first and second year, his room was our circle's common room. The movies, TV series, laughs will be remembered :)

He is the hostel representative who (in spite of repeated complaints to get the bathroom fixed..kidding :D ) lead AH4 to victory in Zephyr2011. Derives joy in fanning on some controversial discussion. He is the friend who always comes for an ice-gola, dances the hardest during DJ nights, takes the lite-est lite and enjoys life to the fullest. All the best.

<p>I sat beside some guy from delhi my first day here during registration.He went on to be one of my closest and best friends in a short few years.Pritish is a great guy,a fun loving and an emotionally very mature person whos always enjoying himself no matter what.I shall always cherish the countless debates we had over everything that caught our fancy.I can't imagine anyone else who could pull off those 'controversial' discussions with the unique style he does.The most knowledgeable guy I know when it comes to hindi movies,Pritish is the guy who has really brought out my fun side,during Waves or otherwise ;-) Quick to call me chu,he has constantly reminded me of the important fact that theres always more to life than grades and the next test!All those mess discussions,the facebook 'jokes',the beach trips.. are some awesome memories I'm grateful to share with him.Even when I doubted myself,I drew strength from his unwavering support.I guess all of us will always fondly remember him as our fearless leader who rallied us to a smashing Zephyr victory,when it really mattered.

Always a smile on his face,he takes life the right way.Wish great things for you ahead,and hope we stay friends forever....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
<p>He is one "tadkedaar" punjabi munda. We know each other not through a rigorous friendship but via an awesome bonding built on meetings in corridors :P He literally lead AH4 to victory in Zephyr, which was one of the best memories I have of my campus life. Sometimes he can be a little mean but woh sab li8 'cause he will definitely make up for it with his humor and charm. He was in Arts & Deco in the first year and I remember his presence in DoCW due to the "rose" incident in Waves 09 :P I know there is an awesome future in stock for him :) All the best and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>

<p>Pritish, my oldest friend (i think 12 years), warm-hearted, soft-spoken and a chill-maar kinda guy. There are very few people in this campus that personify "Li8" and he is one of them. Always ready to help, in all matters (you know,, right :D), he is the person I would turn up to in sad times, and he would greet with me with his 90 degrees smile, which is mostly there for no particular reason for most of the times. Keep smiling yaar, always. :)

<p>Pritish garg.........
Lives a floor below but has always been very close to heart since 2nd yr....Mr critic has a definite opinion(opposite of urs) on every stuff from Robert de niro to mess workers lifestyle.....loves to read fiction and watch classic Hollywood movies( add a few DDLJ’s n kabhi khushi kabhi gum’s) this guy has always been synonymous with the word “ah4” to me...pushing people out of their shells he literally singlehandedly united n geared up the then sluggish AH4 to a splendid win in zephr  ushering  in a whole new era of togetherness n giving guys like me further reasons to take pride in being a  ah4ite...a very simple person at heart with a child like smile “preeto” never refuses anything  to anyone (until u don’t BANG his door)....has helped me in so every possible way from  waking me for damned Mup lectures to always(every day...i can bet) waiting for me to take a shower so that i am never alone for mess he deeply understands n genuinely cares for his pals n never ever hurts nebody’s feeling .....i know i cant bring back that old goa trip...those dreamy bogmalo nights, never ending discussions on philosophy:P, cheese omlet only menu,no taxi only bus fights n endless hours i spent in ur rooms when i felt lonely....... but pritish i have safely locked them up in a vault n ur smile is the key to that vault giving me a glimpse of those unforgettebble moments whenever i see u smile... i know ill miss ur room (n that dirty toilet nearby) n ur classic poses n i just cant tell u what else..... All the best comerade with all my heart ....

<p>To be honest, when you first meet Pritish, it is very easy to mistake him for a yet another Delhi boy with his branded Ed Hardy tshirts and his dry sense of humour that often borders with sarcasm. But once I got past his idiosyncricies, I found him to be a very genuine guy and a blast to hang around with. He is a total movie freak and it is he who who introduced me to the world of Alfred Hitchcock's movies and I thank him for that. He possesses the rare ability of being amicable and blunt at the same time and quite a few people might hate his guts, but that's what separates him from the "average joes" of the campus.  I will cherish all the moments that i spent with him, the jokes we cracked and even the arguments we had. No matter how much I'll try to deny this fact, but life at BITS did turn out to be more exciting once he became my friend. I wish him all the joys and happiness that he could possibly imagine.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yafis-sahaf">Yafis Sahaf</a></p>
<p>When i first met him in my 2nd year, i thought him to be extremely genuine and sensible guy (hey, i was wrong :P). Though, he may be quite irritating at times but all these years would not have been same without him. I'll miss the outings we had together, his laugh which is quite famous by now and his statements giving him "pritler" tag.  All the best for your future buddy :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>Pritish. Try to give a statement about any topic in the world in front of him and watch his response. The guy has a counter argument for everything :) Still a very great guy and fun to hang out with. Won us Zephyr by going to each one's room and asking him to participate in the events. Remember the times spent in saikat's room watching random videos and your requests for 3rd grade bollywood songs :). Good luck bro and fyi my bday is on 22nd Apr :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/snehil-srivastava">Snehil Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Only the most soft spoken in the campus,with his unique style of walking and way of talking ,he is easily noticeable .this Hostel Rep won us Zephyr in 3rd year,,A movie enthusiast and Age of empires player ,he has a rather rigid sense of humor ,easy going attitude is one thing i like about him. All the best for your future buddy:)

<p>Our pro hostel rep, this guy is one standout guy from our hostel.Seems to know about everything right from the movies that bombed the Bollywood box office to managing events in zephyr to AOE- nothing is 2 difficult for him. One with a smiling face always that hides a laugh, he is one quintessential happy guy. A bright future awaits you no doubt.. Cheers and keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>
<p>Dilli da dilwala, my carbon copy in more than a few departments (:P). Active, ambitious and most noticeably an angry young man. May sometimes seem argumentative but itna toh chalta hai, aakhir kaar dilli waale hain apna tashan toh dikhega hi. Its hard to find somebody so friendly and helpful, I am glad PS1 gave me an opportunity to know you better. All the best for your future bro, for all I know it would be awesome, stay in touch, enjoy life!! :)    <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shakti-thakran">Shakti Thakran</a></p>
