<p>Priyal!, one of my best friends in the first year, we did not hang out as much after. But AoE has rekindled our love for each other. I'll never forget the day we saw Night at the Museum 2 in the Audi in first year and Priyal said "yeee hindi mein aur bhii acchaa hai " in his typical gujju tone. Years down, hes engineered several gems in the likes of " ultaa lagaaa de naaa" and "ismeiiinn kyaaa haii" . An awesome, lively and funny person to be with, Priyaeeel is obviously a hit with the opposite sex, playboy ekdum. However, of late hes turned his gaze to dusty,(yes, bhatta's ex, well one of them)and is currently living in with him. An ardent united fan he'll be in the common room with a book, even a day before compre.  Its been a pleasure knowing you, jaise AoE meid gold deta hai waise real life mein bhi dena!
