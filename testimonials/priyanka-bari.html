<h1 class="page-title">Priyanka Bari</h1><p>Priyanka is one of the most trustworthy and reliable friends I have. I enjoyed working with her in DoPY since the first year. One of the few people who encouraged me to study here! Without her and Rujuta, my PS1 time in Chennai would have only been a horrible experience. Thanks for all the good times we had there! I also enjoyed the breakfasts we had after consys tuts! Your hardwork and dedication will definitely give you a bright future! All the best; you will be missed, Pingu!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Hi all.. This is not a testimonial, but something I (Priyanka Bari) wanted to share with all my friends..
I remember reading testimonials of seniors (it was fun!) and thinking what all i will write for my friends.. Bt now when its actually my time, I have to really think how to express myself... Its difficult to believe that 3 years in BITS have already passed... Seems like just few days back i had come with my parents to this altogether new place, which gave me THE BEST days of my life. At the same time it feels like I am here for years now, coz i knw this place so well.. So used to it... Had such good time with all u people that I was never homesick... I remember going home during "jaundice vacation" and my granny saying... "u hav 3.5 years more to SPEND (away from home)" and me replying "Its just 3.5 years. I dont hav to spend them, they will just fly off.." And indeed thay have... Thats all for nw.. feel free to write :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>

<p>I remember when I 1st met Priyanka in 1-1. We had almost all classes in common so we grew very close. Maths 1 is one of the few subjects I remember attending and all thanks to you for making it memorable! I shall never forget the several PJ’s we cracked together or the times we spent in library laughing at apparently nothing :D She has even made the emotional movies great fun! (Remember We Are Family? :P) I will never forget the night we watched meteors on the terrace or the one during compre when we stayed up late into the night watching some movie which we stubborn not to stop watching in between. She was also the one who gave me shelter in her room for almost the entire compre when my room was infested by bed bugs in 2-2. An extremely cheerful, always smiling person, she has grown serious about acads since 1st year. She is very determined and one she makes up her mind, no one can change it. Any extra-curricular activity she took up, she followed it diligently and dedicatedly. She was DOPY core member and co-ordi for SPREE’12. She also worked just as hard for backstage and MM. Thanks for being such a great friend. Wish you all the best in future! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>

She is a core membr of DOPY (Ws d Spree’12 co-odinator), a very gud basketball player and also a sketcher (rembr my B’day card  :P). She made me get addictd to the F.R.I.E.N.D.S series (thanx fr dat :D) but watching it wid her ws more fun ?. Widout her I can’t imagine my class hrs bcz d fun vich v hv by jst nonsensely laughing at any dumb things is just awesome.

<p>A cute girl in front of SAC was the first Bitsian I met.  The first few days of BITS itself I came to know her very well. We went together for most of the inductions and took pictures together as well for the DOPY inductions and finally ended in dopy as well the same friends circle too.  The first thing that comes to my mind is studying thermo and prob stat together and I think we did very well in those exams ... staying up on d nyt of my b’day is just unforgettable … The days in the library …me u  shruti and sometimes apoorva on 1 table … laughing lyk crazy for the silliest of the things  …. Ppl staring at us for the same … all this takes a special place in my memories at BITS … One of the best nights ever in campus was jumping out of the window into the terrace and watching the shooting stars … sleeping there with mats and that too a day before tests … was just super amazing … As days passed we became closer … time in mess … sitting for long hours … talking and arguing random things … was all lot of fun … Then comes the second year … there was a quite a change in her studying habits .. (change for the good though :P ) … she became quite studious ( unlike the first year where she had completely reversed her sleep cycle .. that too before exams :P ) … The nyt in pranita’s room was again unforgettable… I think we never had  another funny and hilarious nyt lyk dat eva before ( thanx to pranita’s silliness :P ) … Working with her in DOPY as one of the coordinators was good … A very well organized person … who stands by her decision … fun loving … dedicated and a near perfectionist … a good basket ball player … Hoping to have a great time in the trip we have planned … do keep in touch .. and all the very best for your future ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pooja-anand">Pooja Anand</a></p>
<p>Yo Bari! (That's how I always begin my chats with this cute friend of mine! :) )
I used to call her Bari - as in 'bari-ahes-na?' wala bari in my first year, that time I took time to get acquainted with the 'baari' pronunciation rather than bari, but I have loved the word since then! :)
We did the embarrassing lezhim performance together. It was really fun! We were initially hesitant, but we had a real blast in the end and it shall always be one of my most memorable moments with her, that too on the stage at our auditorium on campus! :D
Bari is a very sweet and helpful person. I always learn new Marathi words and their pronunciations from her :P She is always punctual in booking cakes for our birthdays! And we always have the pre-bday prep in her room! :D
We missed out on our fair lezhim graphs!!! I have had fun 'Sujit Ghosh' sir's classes with her in our Chem-II in 1-2. We used to have a great fun! :P :D
I remember co-hosting the MM Farewell with her in our 1-2, I requested her to do all the 'bhaari' words in it, which she obliged me with.!
I have always promoted A mess, loud and clear, but Bari was the first person I knew who spoke well of that culinary hub! :D
She did a great job with the photography during her post as DoPY Co-ordinator for SPREE 2012 - BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL (!!! :D :D) She was the reason I even though of wearing a blazer at the CoCo dinner, and we had fun sporting it! (Where are those pics, Bari???  - Ruju la vichar! )
She plays amazing basketball! Bari has been one of the most amazing people I came to know on campus and I shall cherish my friendship and memories with her for ages to come!
Stay the same, Priyanka. Don't ever change!

<p>I remember the way I introduced Priyanka to my mother - "This is Bari", I said, and both her and my parents stared. But I think the name becomes her, and "Bari!" gradually graduated to "Bars!" over the years, as did our friendship from unknown Fergussonians to amazing friends! She's sweet, lively and absolute fun. Passionate about photography and just as much about studies, for during the countless times I've run into her in the corridor, she's almost always going to, or back from the library. We have been on MM trips together, and in the MM lezhim performance, and of course so many outings and dinners, and I've gotten to know her as a wonderful friend I want to cherish always. All the best, Bari, and I'm never going to stop calling you that!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>I don't remember when i started calling her 'baari' but now i wonder if i ever called her priyanka. I met bari in my first year and since then we have become really good friends(remember the lezhim performance :P) .  She is really sweet, always enthusiastic, ready to help...and i love her bindass attitude. She is really passionate about photography and a very good basketball player. Over the years that i have known her we have shared really special moments together...compering for MM, our random conversation in my room, sitting in the library, MM outings and the countless number of times or names have created confusion!!  I hope we keep in touch. All the best barii :)!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-dighe">Priyanka Dighe</a></p>
<p>I first met Priyanka through DoPY in 1st year. An excellent videographer and video editor. Takes her studies very seriously which has made her spend a lot of time in the library. Thank you for also motivating me to study many times. Even in all other activities she is involved in, she likes to take initiatives and see to it that everything goes well and perfect. For eg, she is always the one making sure our b'days go well as planned by making sure everything is in place including the candles, always being next to the b'day boy/girl while cutting the cake :P, making sure every1 gets the cake etc. She likes to spread the joy by telling any funny things she heard to every1 around her by pointing to the person who said it (ofcource with laughter :D). I also believe she is a very good observer especially when she is quite. She is cheerful, well organized, helpful and fun to be around (and gets tickled a lot :P). Remain the same and best of luck for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
<p>Bari. Cutie pie. I dont remember how I met her.. But I'm glad we met during the first few days which i believe brought us close to each other :).She is very versatile. She was a member of basketball team in first year, an active member of Dopy and Backstage in 2nd year and Spree Co-orsinator for Dopy in 3rd year. In first year, I had only one impression about her: a stubborn cute little girl! She would sleep the whole day and stay awake in the night. She would not listen to any one of us and thats how she gave me that impression. Back then we also did little bit of combined studies and lots and lots of useless talk :D.In the second year however, she became normal person but somehow turned into a library addict. Inspite of all these constraints, we do share many sweet memories. Few of the worth mentioning ones are "the flicking incident" :D in the 1st year, the ganesh-chaturthi painting in the 2nd year when you helped me do a night-out :). How could I forget mentioning the "ROFL" incident? :P. And yeah, she is a person who can laugh for no reason :P :D. So much so that her eyes start watering. You are a great company.Thank you for being a great friend throughout. You are very focussed and determined, which makes you very unique and gives you the ability to achieve whatever you want to! Be the same. Stay in touch wherever you are :). PS: I appreciate your(and shruti's) efforts to teach me Marathi and continue the same in future :D and do put on some weight before you become invisible :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
<p>Bari and me were friends since +2 days. She used travel more than me to make it to college and classes (I travelled 18kms) hats off to her effort and that as is evident has paid off well. You will see this lanky figure mostly in library or in mess, there very few instances where i have met her than these places. She is very innocent and soft spoken. She was with me in the department of backstage and the Spree CoCo as the DoPy coordinator and she did a very good job in both places. She was also an basket ball team member. As MM members we share a lot of memories and they will surely be remembered.  Hope you get a good PS2 station this time around 'SISTER' and all the best for your future and god bless!!!

<p>Another fellow Fergussonian whom I happen to know after coming here... A small simple stature, always running around, carries a huge bag which can kindof carry her easily, happy always, laughs out loud.(!). on any silly thing.. always jolly....  is how she can be described... The only girl that I have ever known being called by her surname (unlike guys).... She laughs for no reason... And just goes on and on and on..  A very cheerful person she is... Very kind at heart... Willing to help anyone, anytime, in any possible way.. One to whom you can ask for help openly and it is for sure guaranteed... !!! .. . One of those people who is always present in the library whenever you go.... A true lover of sleep... She is so fond that she just dozes off anytime... . A very simple and kiddish behavior throws light on the innocence that she bears under the hood... Cracks innocent and childish jokes most of the times which lighten the mood of the listener,.. A person who loves to talk...  Most of the times its nonsense which you would be clueless of.. :P (Can go on for hours... Beware!!! :P If you are in a rush, she is the last possible person that you bump into...  :P)  She is that kind of a person who wants things to happen the way she desires.... She makes her best efforts so as to achieve things as she wants them to be... Extremely passionate about new things... Anything new pops up, she is the first one to reach there and explore out.... One of the qualities of her which is admirable is that she never gives up... When she decides something... She never leaves it undone... Completes it with full dedication... A very intelligent girl who always finds shortcut solutions to a problem and does it correctly (lazyish attitude... :P)... She has a tremendous power of grasping things at the first moment itself... And hence need not look back at them as its already occupying some memory space in her brain …that brain of hers has got infinite amount of storage space.. (Cherish it... You will make wonders happen...!!!) She is a person who wants people around her to be happy... Always spreads out the positive wave of joy.... !! Such a wonderful friend she is... Nice to be around.. !!! happy and cheerful always... Thanks for giving me this lifelong friendship to cherish forever ... !!! And hope you have a bright future ahead just like yourself... .!!! All the best... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>Priyanka!  Weird that i call(sometimes) you priyanka even now. I remember days in first sem when i thought i was the only one who kinda looked underaged for engineering. Relieved when i saw you and pooja:P... I always wanted to take a picture of you falling asleep in the class/ library ( Damn cute!!). You are a fun person to be around. We had a great time in labs..fighting, me learning marati and you trying very hard to teach.The only sentence i perfectly remember..kaay karte tu?!.  Will not forget that chillar plant day..especially climbing down the overhead tank..Sorry again!(It's funny though :P). You are one of those people who tolerated my intolerance( remember the video shooting:D ).  Thanks for that!! All the best for everything!  Yay!! we have one more sem together.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srija-reddy">Srija Reddy</a></p>
<p>The first i met Priyanka WAS while going to Pune. And she made me sit in the water dripping window seat for almost the whole of journey. I was so furious at her for that... My next encounter with her was at the MM Ganesh Chaturthi practices, where i found out she was a nice person after all. She is the kinda person whom you can go to if you have any problem and she'll surely take care of it for you. She helped me a lot through the dreadful Opti and OpRe courses ('twas all in vain though). Be it the library, an MM meeting or the coco meetings(had to mention it somewhere :p) she always carries a bag of her own size, probably because she did always come from the library. She is one of the very few who can give Datye and Gudghe a close fight for the library dude position (Ofcourse then it would have been queen :P) She will laugh at every PJ you crack. She always has some interesting stories to share, be it about the cat guy, or rujuta's falling incident(s) and many more. She is very clever, crerative enthusiastic and hard working.  All the best for your future. May you get whatever you desire.  Adious. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tanmay-binaykiya">Tanmay Binaykiya</a></p>
<p>Bariii.. sweet, hard working and fun loving..actually i really wonder sometimes if that smile of urs goes off ever...!! u talk to her, discuss something..one second it seems like she is worried abt it and the next she ll say "lite.!!" Thats what i admire about you..coz not all people can be so confident as to not worry abt daily things.. We have had a lott in common..from jogging, basketball (really all those jokes we had there make me smile whenever i think abt it )..then leaving baskeball together, and swithching to chemical..it has been great with u always...and yaaa the best part is how we used to tease each other in class, made the courses bearable..!!!it has just been awsum..!! to all the people reading this, beware of her dreams..she doesnt look like it, but she is crazy in sleep (:P)!!!!  
all the best for everything.,!! and just stay as u r, enjoying every day as it comes..!! :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tapsi-dubey">Tapsi Dubey</a></p>
<p>Bari!.. She is the first person whom I met after reaching the campus. In fact I signed the register in the main gate just after her (it still feels like that was done only yesterday). You can always find her with a sweet smile and a determined look on her face. We have had very different time schedules throughout our first 2yrs, she being late to bed and late to be up type and me otherwise. However, since third yr, we have had much more chances to interact. She always spends time in the lib, and yet manages not to be in the nerd category!!! Very hardworking, sincere and a fun loving person. :) Wish you All the Best Priyanka ! Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
<p>Priyanka Bari, when I met her, her surname seemed apt, bari, just short of being barik. That's not the case anymore though. A major portion of my early Dept of Photography life is carved around her. Though most of those memories are mere glimpses now, I can still remember you laughing at my stupid jokes(took some time to realize that you laughed at almost anything actually) doing many coverages together (we were tagged as the 'video' team in the dept), The fun we had during our first SPREE (team YO) , editing the TeD videos and subsequently watching Dil Chahta Hai in Audi, the countless "tickling" sessions. These are the few quantifiable moments that I can speak of while there are innumerable instances which cannot be described but remind me of the really fun times we had together. Her life here at BITS can literally be divided into 2 phases. The outside-lib phase and the inside-lib one. Both phases have shown a very different side of her. She is a very practical person. To her, getting a job done without any delay is of paramount importance. Everything else is secondary. I've despised her for this extremely straightforward terminator-esque attitude but in the end it always turns out well so alls good. She is also extremely adamant. Doing a Somersault over B-Dome would be easier than changing her opinion . It has caused frustrations in the past but its all something we relate with her now. She has been a very enthusiastic girl right from the beginning. She likes to be well informed about all the happenings around her. She knows what she likes and makes sure she doesn't indulge in excesses. She's a great Basketball player though she left it after her first year to concentrate more on her studies. She cant stand it if someone is at peace and makes sure the person is disturbed in some or the other way. I have banked on this habit of hers so that I can get a reason to tickle her back (which is something I enjoy). Her voice can be very shrill depending on her level of frustration (which runs high many times).She is extremely pretty but looks like a Kaku when she wears those damned specs .I wish there was more to this episode and we would've had another sem together . Nonetheless it has been wonderful having a unique friend like you. I know that if you want something , you will get it definitely. That's just the way you are and that's awesome! Keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>
<p>Bari.... I guess everyone calls her from her last name... cutest gal i ve seen... but don go on her looks, she is one of the most mature person I have ever seen, We had an awesome time together be it Pom... presentation, meetings, role-play , working in DoPy..., making the hostel-video for zephyr... or teasing pooja... I remember the times, we spent before our 1-1 compre, meteorite shower... Simply amazing... one can always see her in library...  she is very sincere and smart... and her work in DoPY as the spree coordinator is really commendable... only girl to work in backstage... really manage her acads and Co-curriculars well... be in touch and take care<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>A very kind and sweet little girl....always cheerful and happy....also good at handling work responsibly....be it backstage or dopy......did a good at both departments.... does a lot of hard work..... a library girl :P (...u will see her there literally every day :P ) yeah also she is naughty at times and comedy too :)..  Hope you achieve greats heights in life. Best luck :)

I have been saving this one testimonial for the last!
Not just because it will be long but because it means so much to me.
Out of all my friends here and all dose people and different groups i have had fun with, bari has been the one constant person all the time.
Knew her since my first day here, knew her through the lezim practice, was wid her all the tym during fests, b4 dopy and during dopy, in lib, in mess and even in chennai where v stayed together and did the same project, all dose bdays v celebrated and so many many more things!
There are ppl i knew in first yr and lost touch wid later.
There were ppl i came to know later and who i hang out wid now.
But bari i have known since that 2nd day and there never was a tym wn she wasnt around :)
In fact i have bcum so accustomed to her all dese 3 yrs dat if she isnt here for a few days it feels so wierd >.<
The first proper puneri friend i made :P and what a friend! 
There is so much i am grateful to her for!
But first about her : P
She is an amazing person! Can have so much fun with her! Enthusiastic about everything :P and very much committed to wtever she does.
Also has bcum very serious in acads and dat shows in her grades :P
Very very determined and dedicated to everything she does.
Its very very hard to b dat determined seriously..i have tried :P
She is extremely cute, always jumping around :P , looks small but is really strong and can hit back any guy dat tries to tickle her :P
Also a gr8 basketball player (ws surprised to see dat in first yr :P ) and ws d only reason i saw ne basketball matches in spree.
Very organized, has her head calm n clear all the time, knows what needs to b done and will always get it done!
ALso someone i count on so much!  
Very caring(even nw as i write she is askin me if she cn get me nethin to eat coz i ws lazy enough to keep the tesimonials till d end n nw dnt have tym to eat lunch :P ) and i still remember her and shruti and gargi being there all the time even when i ws in d hospital coz of d fit. 
When v got our ps1 in chennai d only reason i didnt start cryin ws coz she wud b der wid me n i wudnt b alone.
And it ws so good. I ws sceptical if i cn stay wid sum1 dat long (stay in d same room,eat together, talk a lot and walk everywer together) widout gettin bored of dat person or irritated. I still think i cant do dat wid sum1 easily.
But wid bari, it ws so easy and i loved every minute of it.
Not just there even here after cumin back v have dese long talks about everything under the sun and it just feels so nice.
Now the things i m grateful to her for!
I am pretty sure i'll miss out many..but dopy is the first one.
She was the one who told me to join it and it was the best for me.. I never enjoyed campus lyf lyk dat b4 and it was all bcoz of her. In fact nt just tellin me to join, the fact that she ws der made all the difference!
Another was lib..she was the bcoz of whom i started goin there and it has helped a lot!
Then there was A mess. I had always been a C mess regular but bcoz of her i started goin to A mess and have never been to C mess since :P
And all the friends i made bcoz of these last 2 things : vaze,pooja,vydehi,apporva,mss ..cnt imagine lyf widout dem..all dese things i am so very grateful to her for!
So many memories wid her,makin dose videos for mm, d machhar photos, chennai, dopy, d greetin card, d bdays, farewell, preparation for farewell, our talks, playing cards, pictionary in lib :P and so much more!
I am not sayin goodbye..not now not even after our fabulous trip!
As i said in shruti's testimonial...i m goin to keep showin up regularly and we'll have a blast :P
U r undoubtedly the best thing dat happnd to me in campus, and I love you a lot! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rujuta-salunkhe">Rujuta Salunkhe</a></p>
