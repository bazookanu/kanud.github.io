<p>When I met her the first time, I was like she is so pretty. Her happy-go-lucky nature and radiant smile will instantly light up your day. She personifies beauty with brains. She is an intelligent and sincere student who manages to have all the fun while maintaining her grades effortlessly. She is always game for any group outing. I have always adored her fashion sense. Loves shopping. She is as health-conscious as me :P. Her room beautifully captures her creative side. Sometimes her child-like demeanor goes a little over-the-top but at times, it is equally appealing. I know you will grow up to become a very successful person unless 2012 happens to be the end of all:P (I am so looking forward to our Bangalore plans). I hope you will remember me down the memory lane.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-dhoot">Shruti Dhoot</a></p>

<p>Pump! (This word just makes me get up and do a li'l jig :D !! )
One of my initial friends on campus, Pump as I love to call her is one of the sweetest persons I happen to know. Always smiling and jolly, she is a great friend. I have had some amazing moments with her .. like during our oh-so-embarrasing lezhim performance in the first year, NUM3ERS during Quark '10 (remember that? :O), memorable pics on the beach and great time just talking to her in general.
It is always a pleasure to have her around and I hope you stay the same and never change!
Go Pump! Pump it Louder!

<p>We have same name and yet I call her Priyanka. Having met for the “Lezhim” performance, it was great time with you along with others… She is very cute, childish (and yet mature), smiling person... Manages to do well in acads ‘ekdum aramaat’ as everyone said… I remember hosting one MM farewell with her… She is the antakshari library..! Can go on suggesting (and singing) songs until everyone is tired… I remember dudhsagar trip (when we never reached the falls :P) where everyone gave up and she still had songs in her mind (not repeated throughout the day!)… I always used to stop by her room and chat for a while… (now I changed my route :P).. She loves shopping and always gets her bag filled up with new clothes every vacation ;) Also she is the one with highest number of footwear I guess (:P) Her room has very nice ambience.. Yellow lights look just great and her free time paintings are also very creative... You will always be remembered as one of the many Priyankas that I know :) With your sincere efforts in whatever you do, you will definitely get what you want… Good luck! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>

<p>Cute is the word that comes to the mind when you think of Priyanka. She is one of the cutest and bubbliest girls I have known. Will never forget the fun we had in MT2 (esp. electrical) labs together. She is extremely dedicated and hardworking too. Looking at her you will feel guilty about taking a break anytime. I simply love her fashion sense and the way she has decorated her room making it so cute! Extremely sweet and helpful, it’s been great knowing you. All the best for the future! I am sure you will do great! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
