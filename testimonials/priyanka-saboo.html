<h1 class="page-title">Priyanka Saboo</h1><p>Pinku, I've checked you out since the first day of college! You reminded me of someone from school. I think the first time we actually spoke was in 1-2 when you joined Dance Club and i used to tease you and Gari with you know who during Quark practice :P The time we realised that everyone around us had played all the games we played in our childhood with hindi names and we were probably the only 2 who knew them in English! All our conversations about the chapters we studied in 10th when we realised we were both in ICSE and the school hymns we sang! You're one person who makes people so comfortable. Whenever i need someone to talk to you're the first person who comes to my mind cause i always feel you'll be non-judgmental. Even back in 2-1 when we weren't that close, it was just so easy to talk to you. In 2-2 when we were group leaders for "Present" in Dance Nite and you said you couldn't be sexy cause you were wearing specs :P We became close in 3-1. We tried having night-outs and you slept  though all of them! Our Bogmalo trip where you got a lot of secrets out of Avni and me, don't worry next time we'll get to know your secrets as well ;) You've seen all the sides of me, happy, sad, drunk, jealous (:P). I really admire how practical you are and i really wish someday i can be a little less emotional and a little more like you. You've been such a darling. We don't meet everyday, n we don't spend much time together, but you'll still always hold a very special place in my heart. I love you <3<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Saboo.. I am sure that there is no power in this world that could break our friendship!! After all the things people have made us go through in these three years i feel proud to say that we are  BEST FRIENDS!! :) (and yes this time i am saying it! :P) You are a person who will give a second chance to anyone, and this is your most amazing and most annoying quality (coz as soon as i start bitching about someone you start off : "Its fine na.. Lite le..") I love making fun of you and i have learnt the same quality from you a lot! We will always be the proud members of Vandith's gang and i will never forget your induction and ragging!! :P I am going to miss the long core meetings.. drama discussions.. you correcting my english.. and the never ending nightouts.. I am definitely going to miss making fun of your phone, your photos and your height! :P There are thoughts right now just running through my mind and i am smiling so hard that my cheeks hurt.. I will never be able to express in words what we have.. Just remember its very close to my heart.. I am going to miss you like crazy! Always keep smiling.. Love you soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much! :-) (PS: i hope you get married before me! :D )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/avni-goyal">Avni Goyal</a></p>
<p>I met saboosh in first year, first day of college in common room while i's playing carrom. That day we stayed awake till 4 or something, talking. Next day we were sitting in audi in orientation session, checking out guys and bookmarking them :P. And since then nothing has changed much. So many walks, So many night outs, so many bogmalo trips, so many movies, so many saboo sleeping in my room and i'm trying to kick her out moments. She has been the closest friend i never had. You can tell your deepest darkest secrets to her and feel ok about it. She has always been the first choice to watch movies with, go shopping, gossip, cry, laugh or anything else. People say I'm in love with priyanka saboo. And you know what I'm :P. Anyway, Testimonials are for people who want to say goodbye so fuck you I'm not writing you more. p.s- Sundar, sushil, padhi likhi, vyavharkik maddu. She doesnt know how to cook food but makes brilliant maggi and when people around her are hungry, she always has big stock of food which her mom sends. She can also speak in englis and will keep correcting your english till you hit her. Also dances also bheri well. Drop a mail to her and stand in queue, she is probably getting married in next two years. Eligibility(higher to lower priority)- 1. should be maddu 2. A rich maddu 3. A rich maddu with no moustache.
