<h1 class="page-title">Priyanka Syal</h1><p>Syal! Ever since the DD day i knew we will be good friends and cause havoc! :D You are a true item and i don't think i'll ever meet someone quite like you. You have a seriously amazing smile so please be happy always and reduce your worries and tensions in life :P We have had many amazing times together and i hope they do not come to an end :') You have really made many things interesting and i had a lot of fun with you especially during the 2nd sem. I know sometimes we don't meet at days to end but it really sucks that you live on a different floor :-/ The late night hungama has sure made this boring hostel interesting as well at times ;) It really was fun scandalizing and terrorizing people with you :D Soooooooooooo Ms Punjaban hawtieeee will you do fraaaaaandship with me? :D :-* Don't ever forget me or keep in mind i'll come from the other end of the world to kick you hard!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>

<p>Syal, what a girl!! one of the most fun loving and bindaass gals ive ever met.. she traps you in her maze of never ending talks in such a way that you are left no option but to listen to her amusing stories and participate in the energetic conversations. I met her in my short visit to NIT k for some workshop, and in less than a day, we became good friends, thanks to Ms chatterbox. In my real short duration of acquaintance with her, she was able to make an indelible mark on my life..She possesses the power of bringing a smile to almost anyone's face.. good at cards, (perhaps the only thing we learnt in that wrokshop :P :P), her short and memorable company was real fun, All the best for al your future endeavours :) cheerio!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Priyanka! yes i do remember talking about chandigarh and the people there since semester 1 but as time passed i came to know you better. You are one of the very few people in campus who seems to understand my perspective about certain things and so do I about yours. I love the fact that you are what you are anywhere anytime. You are outspoken but very clean at heart.I appreciate your unbiased views about things, your fearlessness and your urge to do ANYTHING for your friends. It is indeed great that i met you. All the best and stay in touch :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>
<p>Syaaaal!! One of the first people i met on campus! I still remember that day, you were sitting in the common room watching television when me and Shivi walked in and we spoke. You were instantly likeable and that very moment i knew we would be friends for the rest of our college life. I love the way you are always jumping around and upto some mischief (i still think the shaitan khopdi of our batch should have been you! :P) and when you and kriti are together its a recipe for disaster (read delicate darling! :P). Whether it be our countless gossiping/bitching sessions or my advice taking sessions on how to get a 7 or our girl talk sessions(which Kriti never understood) or you telling me to leave-my-hair-open-sessions i will miss them all. Its just amazing how you manage to have all the fun in the world and still beat the crap out of every exam you give. You have been there for me when a lot of people haven't and i m truly thankful for that. You are an amazing friend and someone i will truly cherish knowing for the rest of my life. All the best for future. :*
P.S i just totally love that smile of yours, keep showing it off always! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>

<p>The first impression that you form of her is-'cheerful’ and ‘always ready to chat’. We stay in the same corridor and I have always seen her in a jolly mood..befriends people easily …An  ever smiling person ! She is caring, fun loving and very helpful. I will always remember the fun we had together, be it the water fight (:P) or pizza sessions..Even now, when we do not have any common subjects, she makes an effort to know about the courses I have, the teachers, whether I am  liking the courses or not and everything…brainy and pretty..lives life on her own terms! Wishing you all the best for your future endeavous! :) ? <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>

<p>Syal! Epic TRW was indeed epic! If it wasn't for that group, I would've have missed the chance of getting to know one of the most free spirited people I've ever met. I really admire the way you gel with everyone, always have something interesting to talk about, you can learn and remember so much in no time, and the fact that you have the most awesome taste in music and movies. 
I remember all our bitching sessions and although I did most of the listening (:P), it was awesome fun. But yeah, you really helped me sort out a lot of things and many thanks for that. I hope you achieve everything you wish for. Good luck! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neil-dhruva">Neil Dhruva</a></p>
