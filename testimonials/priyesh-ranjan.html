<p>Priyesh Ranjan aka Niranjan. He is my one of the first friends in the campus. He is open to anything except a few things (boozing and etc). ;) He is always ready for fun loving and adventure trips. He is also a great badminton, tt, cricket and a chess player. He is very fond of sports and very lazy when it comes to eating options. :) I will always remember late night teas @ mongi, non stop lan CS and all the trips we had together. I wish him a very successful life ahead. Cheers, amigo. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhruv-vyas">Dhruv Vyas</a></p>
