<h1 class="page-title">Priyesh Shrivastava</h1><p>"matsyadevta" Ohh fish! sastaaaaaa....... kita? kita? are some of the many words\phrases i would remember him for. The level of his pjs can sometimes supersede your expectations and that too by quite some level. But he has a great desire for knowledge, some of the very few people who take interest in what they do and what they study. He knows his stuff and is not shy to try it out. You will go a long way up mate.. All the best for everything :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Priyesh is an exceptionally talented yet very down-to-earth person. I first met him after MUP paper distribution, were he gave no signs that he was the topper :-). He has really good coding skills and has all the fundamental concepts very clear. Besides being all brainy he is also very helpful. I hope he achieves great success in future. All the best !!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-gote">Paritosh Gote</a></p>
<p>A phrase to describe Priyesh would be -"A zany geeky  genius" .He will make you laugh,he will irritate you, he will make you want to kill him and most of all  he will amaze you with his genius.He might come of  initially as a taciturn guy but he has become one of my dearest friends in life.I remember him have a fetish for "Soltion Manual"(this isn't incorrect spelling) in the first year.In the second year he would come to my room  and break his head and be amazed at my ignorance in coding. And then he went on top Micro-processor in 2-2 (well....almost)One thing I have noticed about him is his ability to bring out complex solutions out of thin air.Apart from his academic exploits he is also amazing at mimicry (huge fan of Pakistani roadies and Indian as well). If he is not coding then he can be found swearing in "Raghu ram's" style in the corridor. He has listened to maximum number of songs in this campus (....easily).  75% of my playlist is due to Priyesh. 
One thing that I have observed is  that he is himself at all times and is not even one bit hypocritical. Amazing enthusiasm for doing crazy things at crazy times.A very caring friend (took care of me when i was sick...literally) and a gentle human being. After 3 years I am proud to say that you were my neighbor and I will certainly miss those amazing times we have had together and I wish you all the success and happiness in your future endeavors.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>I met priyesh in PS. And it was sooo much of fun . Be it  jatropha ka tel nikalna or conference room mein baith ke random bakwaas karna. Apart from ps,  I think i learnt about OS from him equally as from OS class. He's a proper nerd, sweet guy, PJ king, always there to clear doubts. I still can hear him saying "sasta tha bhai" at random things.  All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>"fishhh" is what people call him.... but i call him "fishhh".. dont be surprised/confused, this is one of levels of the PJs he always delivers at regular intervals!! He is undoubtedly PJ king, ready to produce any of his PJs at any time u ask for!! he is BAAP of coding. i wont be surprised if he dies of starving i his room, with coding screen on his laptop n his fingers on the keyboard!! Though BITS has given him one room, but you will always find him in his neighbor's (Bellu's) room, playing some of his crappy heavy metal songs, blowing off everyone's mind!! He also does Mimicry (only of raghu n pakistani "raghu" :P) keeps on saying "sir, main ch***** hu hi nahi sir!!" and "Bottle ka jo paani hai.." those are his fav lines. apart from fun and entertainment, priyesh is gud at CS subjects, i must say very gud. he is always helpful. he always has mood shifts, whenver he is working/coding, he is damn serious n passionate about it. but whenever, YOU are working, he never leaves any opportunity to make you feel like killing him :P. btw, never try to PJ-fy him.. its his trigger to come-up with more of that kind n of higher levels.. :P. He is a great friend to hang out with, i il never forget those cool campus trolls always planned by him after dinner!! he is kind hearted but very deterministic towards his studies. he is very passionate about coding n computer languages, n i hope he does great in this branch in his future, as he is doing now!! best of luck mate!! long way to go..!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nilesh-bhala">Nilesh Bhala</a></p>
<p>Priyesh , the little genius that he is, sometimes his quick answers to challenging doubts makes one wonder.. too much grey matter in too little space!! 
We were mere acquaintances before third year, played table tennis occasionally , but now , in less than a year, hes made a vital place in my life.. Endowed with exceptional coding skills, sometimes he makes me wonder if hes living in some kind of a matrix, with algorithms and bits floating all around , and he busy coding them, all in parallel .. :P.. jokes apart, priyesh is a fun person, who, after learning a lot and after constant improvement, he has managed to uplift his jokes from the sasta category, to not-so-sasta- category :P, hes a good company, likes to live life freeely, without any constraints or boundations (if you know what i mean :P) .. hes the one person you can look up to for almost any academic doubt, a man of determination, and a humble and a down to earth person, "koi kitni bhi le, he doesnt get angry.." I will always remember some of the phrases he taught me- "nice value (for nice one!!)"
, "macha diya :P" . to name a few.. may you achieve whatever you strive for and do more projects with us and give us free grades, all the best for all your future endeavours .. take care. (t.c. -> thats totally different from what you think. :P :P :P ), kyu bhai?

but yeah this fish is d "whale shark" of d computer science people i know,
He's d best, i mean THE BEST, coder , n its natural to him, he doesn't have to work hard like many others for this speciality, he can solve ne programatic problem within seconds, without writing single letter on d paper, 
yes he did it in many of his jus "ans" type comp. papers, he has d sharpest mind< i respect it...> when it comes to coding, u know i once saw "mark zuckerberg" in you when i saw u answerin' those 8 register bits once asked in MUP <while u wer almost asleep in  d lecture on d last bench in LT>, more than u wer asked, 
u may b not that helpful<no, u r NOT , or jus to me> or u speak in code when asked for help, which only som know how to decrypt n use it...
but i can b sure that u r best computer student by ur own, without efforts< like others > , u r made for it man!!!, u wud've screwed in ne other stream, unlike others who still wud've been gud in ne other<i believe>.
he's also d humorous person, n call him witty too...

<p>Priyesh Srivastava , 'Tender And Technically & Thoroughly Intelligent' person . He is a very simple guy. You will generally find him in simple si bermuda, plain si tshirt, Baal always udte hue..... no showoff, no worries but phodu computations of exponential order going on in his mind continuously; that's the way of his life."SIMPLE LIVING and HIGH LEVEL CODING" is his motto.  
 He NEVER gets angry and is very patient.  When I was angry he even bore my shouts and tried to passify me. He is a very optimistic person.And commitment to bhai itna hai ki anything he lays his eyes on, he will take it at any cost.. . He is a very innocent guy and an awsme cauder.......
He is so gud at programming and so helpful that most of our projects and assignments  could be completed because of him. And the gud part is that he never boasts about anything.
Many a times we take all the credit of what he did but he says nothing. 
Each and everything that I do on my system whether it be on UBUNTU..or  installing new softwares....etc , he has always helped me. Even today when I look at my computer or work on Gnome it reminds me of him. Most of the songs which I like were suggested by him only.
He is a true friend as he has always been motivating me. There were times when I got fed up of him pinging me on Gtalk during the summer vacations telling me to start learning php instead of wasting my time at home. .....    
My prayers are with you & you will get great success in life...U deserve much more than wat u get..... Never forget me.....Will miss you and these wonderful days.........Be always in touch.......I thank god for making you my friend.
 To tell u about priyesh in short I would like you to listen to  a very famous song which I think I am going to sing 5 years down the line while thinking about him..."Behti hawa sa tha wo.....Udti patang sa tha wo........Yaar humara tha wo...... Chhuke humare dil ko...............". He is Rancho to me....both as a GENIUS minded person  and a DEAREST FRIEND....Tc....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>
<p>had heard a lot about him as the MuP topper and geek guy etc.. but talked to him properly in PS1. at first he looked quite serious and introvert but what followed totally reversed my perception... 2 months at PS1 with him were.. i won't say absolute fun but more of interesting... he is one unique guy with a very unique sense of humor which no one usually understands except a few people :P ... has been a good friend since then and helped a lot in labs... I wish you all the very best in your future endeavors!!! Stay in touch. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>Priyesh a.k.a fish a.ka. matsyadevta is a wacky whiz-kid. He is a genius coder and a true geek, always ready to learn new things related to computer science. He can always be found tinkering with his laptop, or roaming around the hostel like a bhatakti aatma :P. His expertise in algorithm and problem solving is prolific. Although he does not always find the simplest of solutions, but you can't help but wonder at the elegnce of his ingenious solutions. He is also always pseudo-ready to help in acads. Saala pehle bhaav khayega, but will explain it to you anyway in the end :). He is a huge fan of music. I believe he has listened to almost all English songs on DC, and every now and then he will suggest an awesome song that you will keep listening for the next few days. He is also good at mimicry, but does have a pitiful sense of humour. He is witty but still contrary to his personal belief most of his jokes are pathetic. At times this guy can be so annoying that you could not help but devise a plan to finish him for once and for all. But there will be times when you cant be thankful enough for him being your friend. He is one of the most honest person, and  whatever is in his heart is on his tongue. There is no shard of pretentiousness in him. He is also very sportive and takes the frequent jibes at him in good humour, and also returns them like Newton's 3rd law :P.
<p><p>
Here's a toast to all of your sastas, to the roadies/rowdies/pakistani_roadies mimicry, to soltion soltion and kitta kitta kitta !!, to all your help in CS cdcs and what not, and to all the laughter and sotd(sasta/song of the day). Your are destined for great achievements, be confident. Best wishes for your future :).
