<h1 class="page-title">Puneet Pratap Singh Chauhan</h1><p>The "Razor1911" . Who on campus doesn't know him ! Handsome, smart, carefree, chilled out. Always smiling ! Keep it the same way man ! Was always the target of profs here :D .. but a good friend. One of the best seniors I first met on Campus ! And I did many courses with him :D . A partner in MT2 as well.  A football n Basketball  freak. Follows his passion. Does what he lies, without caring about what the world thinks. This is the best thing I like about him. Keep going dude ! All the luck n wishes in future ahead ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>The day when we first met, He seemed like a normal guy. And then the sem started. He was the center of the corridor for the first sem with all his carefree attitude, good looks and convincing powers, winning people over. And of course then were his grades, because of which he became more famous. But there is definitely much more to him that.
We have had so many discussions on his way of life, my way of life, other's way of life, but it doesn't matter. Deep down, i know he is worried but enjoys life too much to actually care about that. 
There have been so many instances where he has helped me that I have lost count (but I am sure i have helped more :P). My constant pestering him to study and take it all a little 
seriously, his loud music ( I still hate metal, it's just noise :| ), the jhagde, the photos, the gossips, the meanfulness, the Bhabhijis, the ups and downs, the mood swings, the games, the trips, the plans, the nautanki, the face packs, the movies, the treats, the cartoongiri, the smell ( :D ) and my smelling obsession, the nakhre,the happiness, the Maggis, the hawa... we have had so many things together, the list is endless. I have probably shared the most with him than any other person on campus (sadly, not even a girl :( )
Though the campus knows him for other reasons, I don't even know whether I know him or not. Highly Pendulum-ic. Then of course, his stories. The stuff he says seems unbelievable to me. And the stuff he does is also unbelievable to me. But he is doing it. And when he might be telling what he is doing right now to someone else, far from here, I am pretty convinced that, that person will say: kuch bhi. Even I actually don't believe him. But as I said, He is doing it.
One thing's for sure, you won't be depressed when he's around. He lives his life the way I can't ever live, and probably I want him to change, but he won't and that i know. 
A very fun-loving person who has intelligence but doesn't put it to proper use. Great marketing and people skills and a finally, the dilli-waala attitude. 
There is no point in going on and on in this relationship of giving and sharing, and receiving and giving and sharing, and receiving and receiving...i'll should stop here :) Waise bhi you know, don't like much to speak :| and i don't think a testimonial can do enough justice.
Three years is a hell lot of time together. Had great and also, not so great times living opposite to you (even with all the kamina-panti :P)  We have our unique personalities and 
perceptions but I hope we both had a positive influence on each other :) All the very best. May you do what you want to do :) Until of course you figure it out :P
PS: aur dekhte hai if you will not reject the video call from me in the future...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>

<p>And after my umpteenth attempt, I have realized it's impossible for me to write a testimonial for you.  All I can say is that this isn't goodbye. Or that there won't be one next year. Or the year after that. Or any number of years after that either. And that I still won't be able to describe in words the bond we've shared. Ever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>The dude. THE Razor1911 - popularity among girls walks hand in hand with his peculiar clothing he calls "his style". He is a born footballer, pretty fast for a giant like him, helpful to the core, Public skills is instilled in him; although he uses most of them in front of his numerous..well lets call them "Lady friends". :P

Very knowledgeable when it comes to different fields such as - Football, Tech Gadgets, and Fernando Torres. :P

It was in my 1-1 when he had this awesome laptop on which we used to watch most of the movies, in 2-1 had some 2-3 bags shipped from his home, full of awesome delicacies, which saved me from many a hungry nights!

The best part was when Ashesh, him & me spent nearly the whole of 3-1 at Ice'n'Spice, discussing the outcome of our lives, the pacts we shook on & the placement tensions I had (and still have!) :P

He loves himself just as much he loves bikes.

Dude, it has been a real honour to have known you. I wish you the best for your future & I hope you fulfill all your dreams in your life - because you deserve them!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
