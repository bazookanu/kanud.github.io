<p>Hum do dost ek  hi cup main chai pite hai, kyunki isse dosti badhti hai :P 
First friend on campus! It's been 3 years of living next to Pushkar, and these three years have been bloody amazing. From the time we first got ragged, to classes,to the epic Bogmalo night out, every memory has been truly awesome. His excellent guitar-playing has brought us all comfort on many  an electricity-less night. All those lazy afternoons, Velind evenings spent making fun of the whole world have been great fun. He's smart, introvert-ish and a whole lot of fun to be with. Nature Baba's cricket skills are the talk of the town. This mornings-hating, music-loving guy is truly one of the most talented,kind hearted quirky person I've ever met. Anyway, Pkman is going to be an amazing professional guitarist with a million groupies, and I can never forget these days.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>First saw you at the cricket nets and was seriously amazed at the amount of pace you could generate with such a slight built :P Pretty akin to Ishant Sharma(ignore the height difference) , with wind in the hair while approaching the stumps, you've been an indispensable part of the college cricket team. Someone who has a lot of knowledge about seam bowling, a fellow Liverpool fan, I came to know about your music prowess pretty late. It has been a pleasure knowing you and having those conversations about the game. Well, MOSTLY about the game.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>My fellow Bandmate, 'Londa'iite and 'Sheri Di Kaum'ian, this guy is one of the coolest people I've met after coming here. His psychaedelic-groovy-eclectic guitar playing also known to some as Free Jazz is a major highlight of Paperkraft. He is also a pro cricketer of which I'vnt seen much. The only regret is that I came to know him well a bit late. But the insane amount of fun we've had together during the last year has really kind of made up for it. Can't wait for more jamming sessions, random chudaap, Bogmalo trips and everything else during the next sem :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>Pushkar and I share a great liking for the worst kind of camp humour, wacky music genres, and discussing absolutely pointless things. Very quick witted and a lot of fun to be around. When he's not putting up with Harsha's PMS, Pushkar's a good guitar player, lyricist and cricketer, and general awesome human. Here's to a great terrace party, sometime!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>One of the most special friends I have acquired over the years, Pushkar is one of the most genuine and downright socially awkward people I have ever known. A prodigal musician that he is, I remember giving him small tips on guitaring in the first year, and now we're in a band together ! :D His growth as a musician has been superb, and I feel so proud playing alongside him ! 
I am not gonna go on a long rant, but he's truely been there through all the shit life's thrown at me, and it's needless to say that a lifetime of friendship and music awaits :D.
And besides, you know too many secrets, I'm not gonna let you go off with them.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aseem-patil">Aseem Patil</a></p>
<p>"PUSHKAARR", that has literally been my war cry for most of these three years I've known Pushkar. He's my go to guy, anything under the sun can be discussed with him and we always end up making it ridiculously hilarious(most by incorporating Randy Jackson's "WHOAAA!! DUUUUUDE!" ). He's one the most genuine people I've ever met and also one of the funniest people I've come across. We've spent countless hours discussing in detail things that have absolutely nothing to do with us but we somehow manage to change such a topic into pure joy and laughter. I can't recall the last time I've left your room without laughing my ass off about something like that! The andaaz apna apna, Hangama, Munna bhai and Dhamaal nights will always be remembered. His ability to transform something mundane and boring into something fun is something i'm really, really going to miss. A career in music beckons one of the best guitarist and human beings i know!  Here's to a long, long friendship to follow! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Pushkar! It was kinda odd actually, first time, he was sitting on the roller during cricket selections, casually as though he was into the team. Then; lunch; one random day at the mess; started talking, I think it was Opeth! Yep! And then followed, the first Spree! I think it was sometime then that pH_Value was first coined! Our music video debut through pH_Value’s cover of Kalmah! The loss at Spree ’10, free dinners where we mooched of mocktails and starters like we’d never seen food before. Those were happy times! Then, another year, he comes back pumped up like he was on a mission! And boy did he accomplish it or what! Highest wicket-taker in  Spree ’11 and most importantly WE WON! The shit we did ( rather didn’t ) staying up till 4 am, following arrows, not following arrows, dreaming about the funniest of people, wearing the funniest of clothes. We talked crap, we talked sense, we talked strategy, we bitched and I’d say it again we won! Broken toes, bloody nose, busted shins, we’ve seen everything playing cricket and I’d say again any day, we saw glory. This was just about the time we saw our career paths and Pushkar the rockstar was born! I’ve always had the utmost respect for this guy for one simple reason; he’s out to get what he wants! Believe me when I tell you, this guy started from beginner to superbloodyinsane at the guitar! While the whole college slogged to get ‘em grades he slogged to play ‘em notes strike those chords and make that music! Although he does give a shit ( a fair amount) about his studies, I honestly think there is no bloody need! He’s one of the few rare people, who’ve dared to do what they love, when the whole world would have told him otherwise. The pace at which he’s running, he’s going to achieve his dream real fast! As a person, he speaks his mind, filled with patience, and I’ve very rarely seen him lose his cool. This guy is one friend one can bank on; to play a prank or to give you advice, “he” is the “go-to-guy.” I’m also, so to speak his “Manejjar” and its been quite a ride so far! Next year shall be great, and dude, I’m still gonna be your manejjar after college too. The founding member of pH_Value, one half of the deadliest “wicket-keeper- opening bowler” pair there IS, a rockstar, a lead guitarist, a budding vocalist and my multi-talented best friend, give it up for Pushkar Srivatsal!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/g-sri-harsha">G Sri Harsha</a></p>

Screw it, I’m going on a long rant. I don’t think I’ve met anyone with such strikingly similar musical tastes as mine, as Pushkar. Over the past 3 years, whenever I had a fixation with any band for extended periods of time, he’s been one person I could always go and discuss it with – ‘cause, coincidentally, he would also be fixated with the same. Be it GnR, RHCP, Opeth, PT, Mayer, Slash, Radiohead, random metal and most importantly - Lonely Island (I still have that epic screenshot which we wanted to make a wallpaper) – we’ve spent countless hours dissecting the lyrics of the songs, discussing histories of the bands and watching recorded concerts in his room, which had become my general location during 2nd year. He’s introduced me to most of the music in my library that isn’t classic rock and has influenced my tastes like no one ever has. Of course, he always understood the music more whereas I was just a very enthusiastic fan. From 1st year, when he used to maintain “I’m just playing for fun” he’s blossomed into one of the most proficient guitarist I know. His dedication towards it is something to draw inspiration from and I can’t say it enough – but he’s gonna stick at it and make it big one day. Hopefully, then he’ll share some of his groupies. Besides music tastes, we also share a common love for Hanush Anand poetry, Maharani beer, Ugandan action movies, Incredibox, the Naked Gun trilogy, retarded internet videos and certain PhD students :P (Which reminds me, mere pass abhi bhi entra ko tapkane ka plan hai. If you’ve not yet accepted defeat, milke game kar dete hain uska) Pushkar suffers from the misfortune of being Harsha’s spouse, having to attend chemical CDC lectures and general host/baby-sitter to random retards from our hostel (including me) – but then he has this brilliant ability to take it all with a pinch of salt and convert it into humorous accounts which are constant fodder for entertainment – making him, by far, the most spontaneous and entertaining person I know. His & Vaas’ epic antics will be among my best memories of college life. That and the fact that they screwed my happiness with those pathetic eggplant caricatures and enormous amount of case taking. But heck, let’s be honest, would you rather remember that or the fact that you had one of the quirkiest, funniest and most multi-talented people of the batch as one of your best friends? Apna bhi bhaav badega… P.S. Despite this testimonial, bear in mind – i WILL kill you if you don’t delete those pathetic photographs.

<p>P.S. The plan is this: Door sunsat mein, usko Lonely Island waale boat pe leke jayege. Aur phir main kahunga, "Leave her, or leave the boat. It's MY boat!" Coz, y'know I have a way with boats... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Pushkar joins the likes of Vaas as one of the coolest guys around and is great fun to be around. Spending 5 minutes with him and listening to him rant about some dimwit in Chemical is enough to lift your mood many times over. Pushkar picked up the guitar while on campus and he's turned into one of the finest guitarists of our batch. He's naturally gifted and has an impeccable sense of melody, for he just seems to know what note to play next! We also had a lot of musical interests in common, interests that resulted in one of the most epic music nights ever! I thoroghly enjoyed performing Blackest Eyes and Drapery Falls last sem, thanks to a shared interest (obssession?) with prog bands like PT and Opeth :D I just wish you could've come for the Opeth concert in B'lore, your company would've been epic!
It's unfortunate that we won't be able to jam together coz of our different PS slots, but I'll always be up for a jam in the future! Cheers man, and all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
