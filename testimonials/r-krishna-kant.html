You are an amazing lab partner :D I mean this.. :P .

<p>He earned his nickname, KAIKO owing to the frequency of the word's usage by him. Kai is a very adventurous and ecstatic person. He has got the creativity to come up with 101 innovative ways to kill time. He has always been my partner in crime and Shabbar always the lab rat. The awesomely weird pranks and insane torture techniques were exhilarating. It kept us engaged and bystanders simply sympathizing with Shabbar. Kai has a good sense of humour and a classy timing too. Our little group has always been together throughout college. I hope we always stay connected. Best of luck Kai!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>Kai mere bhai, as I call him, is one of the nicest of the people I am friends with. Amazing dude with a nice sense of humor, always cool to hang out with. We spend amazing afternoons making fun of people (i don need to name them). A person who i would say has enjoyed every moment of his college life and made sure everyone else does. I love his enthusiasm and zippy humor. I may not say it out a lot but i am really glad knowing awesome human being as you. U rock and keep rocking. \m/ bro!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>KK I still wonder how I could miss my beautiful first two years with you and the strangest thing is that I never seen you until PS1. I can never forget the moments with you in PS1 and our 3rd year. You are awesome both in attitude and humorous, the time just passes in your company. You are very serious about the acads and automobile lover. I hope you would end up in a great car factory like lambo, audi or porsche....... :D and you allow me for a ride :). Hope we have a great holidays ahead and I can never forget you. Stay in touch. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>

<p>KK, haven't known you all that much. But all i can say is that you are friendly, polite, and serious when it comes to work. Ready to take the responsibility of the initiatives that interest you. Your passion for studies is equally commendable. It was really nice knowing you mate. We have got one more year on campus and i hope that this small physics group of ours will go on like this and we will all be in touch.. All the best for the coming years KK :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Why this kolaveri di ??? When we listned to that song did we know it would become so famous ?? Whn we started talking did we know we will get so so F******* close. This is one of my bestest best friend krishnakant. :? No its always KK.
Wht does KK make u feel when u are with him ? Why do i say he is my one of bestest best buddies ?? because when u are with KK he makes u feel the most important person in this whole universe. U can talk to him in any topic, any time and he will never disappoint U if u were searching for a intelligent conversation for years. We are bonded together by a combined chemistry of physics, Music, Philosophy, Humour, etc.... :P . The first time I talked to him he had asked me if i m in physics, and the next time he talked to me, I had given him a oversized Phys Tee(Nilu to be blamed). And from then our frienship is running its course through one of the most beautiful and adventurous lands. I consider his opinion on any subject with top priority. His mind I respect with reverence because when I know that when the whole world wont understand KK always will. Whenever the ship of ur happiness starts to sink KK will increase the density of the fluid (but secretly). He is one of the rare people who owns a telescope(which gave us immense joy and hours of chat and red eyes). Thats speaks of his curiousity. You pick up any random book from a store and KK will always have something to comment on it(thats his outlook). I have a calcualted mind and to repsect someone I take time and KK in my heart in at one of the top echelons of respect(and that is where he will be for the rest of our lifes). KK makes everybody feel differenlty great. What he makes me feel is a BROTHER AT HOME. Cheers to life. Happiness is all I wish !!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/souvik-dutta">Souvik Dutta</a></p>
