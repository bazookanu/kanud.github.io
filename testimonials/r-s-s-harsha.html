<h1 class="page-title">R S S Harsha</h1><p>Writing him a testimonial was heck of a job as i just could not get hold of enough bad words to fill the page.But today when I think of writing about him i cannot get myself to write anythin bad about him. I know him for arnd a year now. One of the best frnz i have on campus. Amazing fun times we have had in past one year over numerous of outings. A genuine guy, Padhta bohot hai sala. With him we were able to conduct one of the best festivals our campus has seen.. :O.(that was surprising).. :P extremely photogenic. ;) 
On the other side a very amazing fun to be with person and definitely a friend for a life time.. =)

<p>Harsha, one of the nicest persons I've come across. Can never imagine myself getting bugged with him or his company. Superb work ethic and amazingly patient. Only two things bug me about you man: One, your a Real Madrid fan and Second, ur in fricking MSc Maths! Spent some great times together and looking forward to some more next sem.

<p>RSS Harsha or RR Patil as we used to call him (do you remember that :P ) is the very FIRST person I talked to in the campus. He has been a friend for 3 years now and though our talking has decreased, we still share some nice jokes and love teasing each other ;). He is one of those weird guys who are passionate about mathematics but what can you do? We need weirdos as well as normal people in the world :D. Apart from that he is very much into a variety of sports and loves playing them as well. Though his getting into DORAH was a surprise to us (he is a really studious guy) I can say now that he deserves all the success he got there and more. So there you are. I wish him the very best for the road ahead and will always remember him as the guy I first talked to in BITS who coincidentally came into my corridor too giving rise to a cool friendship. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>
<p>Yey Harsha....he is one of the good friends working for the department DORAH.....had so much fun in the tent thought i was here in the campus for very few festivals.....and in the cricket matches we played....his bowling style used to remind me of malinga for some aspects....and at the time of exams used to see him coming from library and think i should also study(which i never did once)....remember the incident of godown.....oh damn that day u promised a treat at shahi....had a very good time with u man....all the best for ur future.... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bharath-janyavula">bharath janyavula</a></p>
<p>I still remember it was during the DP class that I met this guy......i just went and sat besides him and we both unanimously started cursing the subject. And after that there was no looking back of our friendship......the hatred for DP grew and so did our friendship ;) Harsha is a total chilled out person and can make any conversation interesting. Lite Lite bol k saala khub padta hai and sexy marks leke aata hai :P Quark mai pathe ne kaam bhi bahut kiya. A charming personality and cool atitude is something unique abt him. Ek saal aur sehan karna hai isse :P Wish u all the best in all your endeavours bro !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Harsha bhaiya..one of the few guys in this campus whom i still like calling bhaiya.. :)
I first met him in one of quark outings last sem(thanks to pranay for inviting me) and since then we have become very good friends...  one of the few with whom you can share anything goin on in your life and he will listen to you patiently and will help you in whatever way he can..  a big time tharki and a dedicated guy :P ... maths phodu and thus the target of many accusations for not letting others get an A :P... his work as the DORAH coordinator for Quark was commendable and has set a benchmark for others succeeding him.. 
Days (and nights :P) spend with you in the Quark room will always remain in my memory as one of the best moments i had :) .. 
today whatever i am or i have i owe him a big time..thanks for being on my side all this time.. may you succeed in getting all A's and lead a successful and happy life :)

<p>RSS aka RR PATIL, this guy gets tensed if a Indian bowler is hit for a six or four, his mood is totally off when india looses a match. His long discussion arre aisa karne se jeet jati etc. U will always find him talking on the phone all day long. He’s a maths pro. In first year he tried to teach us how to speak telgu I guess (all the languages sound the same). He’s always so tensed for petty things but he works very hard to get the work done. Honest, hard working and sincere. He’s a good speaker but our talking has decreased as he’s hardly in the room. Anyways all the best  for the future. Good luck!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Perfectionist at whatever he does whether it be his studies, department work ,flirting :P. He has a capability of moving many minds with his speeches. Dude it was fun hanging out with you for three years --- sumith<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>You will not enjoy teasing anyone else once you start it with this idiot :D I knew him since a long time but only as an acquaintance. I got to know more about him in our past year in Msc Mathematics. Man, I just can't stop having fun teasing him :D Sorry about it but I won't stop :P This guy, is a GOD in mathematics ! The only guy to have understood Measure Theory on our batch. Very sincere, hardworking and honest. Tharkiness flows with every breath he takes :P But an awesome friend to be. Had a great time together. Stay the same. Keep up the good work. Cheers ! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>

<p>I really do not know him personally.. I got in touch with him through Nirmaan in my 2nd year..From the few opportunities which I had to got to meet to him,I can say he is a co-operative,dedicated,sincere leader and is a bit 

delicate(makes sure all the kids are happy and cannot take it if someone punishes them) .. It was really nice working with you in Nirmaan. I am sure you'll reach great heights..All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
