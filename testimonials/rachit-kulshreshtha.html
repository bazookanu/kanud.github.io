<p>Rachit is a great person to work with him. I've worked with him thrice, 1st in DEPP then in BITSAA n finally in melange. After working with him I can say he is very calm (although he tries  to scare everyone with his massive body). He has a huge potential and his hard-work will take him to great heights in future.
Best of Luck Buddy, may u get everything you deserve !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Normally a very calm and composed guy but can transform into "The Angry Young Man" (or the "Gunda") in the times of need.Loves physics,food (especially junk!!)and anything to do with computers.Extremely logical and has a God's gift for solving puzzles ,riddles and any intellectual challenge.Very loyal to all his friends and stands up for them every time. A very dear friend of mine and will always cherish our times together. I wish you a happy and successful life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>"It ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward". This is what Rachit is.

A scouser, an aspiring physicist, a star-gazer, an ardent Rocky fan and the epitome of grittiness. This guy is over-zealous and passionate to the brink of insanity. Once he sets his mind on a task, he'll shake heaven and earth to accomplish it. He was the Celestia coordinator. One look at the club's recent activities and you will understand how zealous this guy can be. He gives the impression of a serious bad-ass. I remember the first time I saw him, with that (ever-present)frown and elbow wrapped in bandages and I thought this is one guy I wouldn't wanna cross. However, truth can't be further from it. I mean, yea he is pretty bad-ass. But still he is a child at heart, unlike the intimidating persona he radiates. Despite his bouts of insanity and immaturity over the years, he has become one of my dearest friends. A friend whom I can always count upon.
Here's a toast to all those cherished moments, the epiphanies that you seem to have on a daily basis, all those time that you drag me to your room and make me watch/listen those crazy videos/songs/pics, and to all the insanity over these past years. 




P.S - nc chal raha hai ? :P

<p>Your calm and composed approach to everything is very inspiring. Beneath the brooding exterior lies a a gentle and caring peronality. I will always remember your words of wisdom and your realistic approach to life. You were awesome as the coordi of Celestia! an one last thing...keep Rocking!! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>When we greet each other we always do it this way. We start at each end of the hall and bash into each others shoulders. It hurts and but then we brush it off and start usual banter about how sucky life is. This Strong yeti-like man has a creative side and soft spot for loud music that plays out of his room 12X7. I love his creative work which is mind-blowing (p.s i have heard about it ;) ). If you ever want boost in the morning. Rachit is the man. He is the man. Say it. Rachit's The MAN. The white Yeti with a paintbrush.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/edwin-abraham">Edwin Abraham</a></p>
<p>Often compared to Osmium because of his rare appearances and tough physique, believe me, he has a Platinum heart. Though he looks tough outside, he's soft like a wax from inside( always forgave me whenever I made fun of Rocky Balboa..rare naa!!!). A genuine, noble and always helping guy. What I say is just a drop in ocean about his personality, truely, one of bestest and most amazing person I've ever met in my entire life... You owe my respect.. /\<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>Good friend and a great fan of Liverpool. Will miss every moment of the matches we have watched together. I know this will sound cliched but, I would again say that never go by his appearance. He is as soft as Velvet from within as he is Iron from outside. The positive attitude that he has even when Liverpool is 2-0 down in a match gives all of us the motivation and energy to bounce back in life and chase our goals. All the best to him. Hope to watch a Liverpool match at Anfield someday with you. We will be Scousers for ever!!

<p>A really sweet and wonderful guy, who is fun to hang out with :) Had an awesome experience working with him for designing the BITSAA souvenirs and he was a great help at all times. Very calm and cool, he is always very cheerful. You will surely make it big in life!! All the best for you future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sonali-bhadra">Sonali Bhadra</a></p>
<p>A Lifelong Scouser,Rachit appears to be a really intimidating person from afar but if u get to know him,you come to know that he has a really soft heart.We bonded a lot while watching football matches together and I must admit his passion for Liverpool amazes me.Plus his gentlemanly attitude towards other fans endears him even more and shows the strength of his character.Extremely chilled out and fun to be with.His passion for food is almost as big as his passion for Liverpool(i am pretty sure even he can't decide between the two) and his visit to NC is almost a regular event each night.I wish him all the best for his future endeavors.
PS:Hope to see a Liverpool-Chelsea match with him in the future either at the Bridge or at Anfield.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/praveen-shreenivas-addagatla">Praveen Shreenivas Addagatla</a></p>
<p>hmm ...Rachit .!!   A seemingly tough person from outside but a very soft and genuine person from the core .. I hardly spent time wid you , but always knew the kindness in you .. The walk wid you around the campus for around 5 times on the day of holi was the one i came to know about yuo precisely . A person as tough as him has a heart tougher than his physique . He is an example of how much a person can endure and still be happy . I respect you for all the things you have done and you are capable of doing .. Best of luck for u r future and FTW ..!!  :P There's lot more for store in you ..!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
<p>Its wonderful to know a person like Rachit. I've first met him as a friend of a friend who shares a same surname :D . Actually interacted with him during Celestia meetings. Rachit is one person who is really interested in Physics and has a great passion for astronomy. The way he worked as a coordinator for Celestia Club shows his zeal and enthusiasm for the thing he is passionate about. Overall I observed him to be a silent person from outside . May luck always stay by your side as you follow your dreams ... All the best ! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>

<p>Rachit ! A guy who is so calm and serious about his work. We have not interacted much though. But I can surely say that he has an enormous potential. I have seen his dedication for work when it was assigned during by Bitsaad. Extremely passionate and generous, this guy is completely down to earth. Whenever asked for help he does so without an itch. I remember the day when you made me learn some photoshop stuff. IT was just so awesome ! I wish you all the very best for your future Rachit and I know you are definitely going to reach the pinnacle of success ! Cheers !! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>
<p>when i first saw him, all i used to ask him was " why so serious man!!" rachit always has a strict expression all over his face! and it is scary at times ! :P also the physique can be intimidating! and then u see his diet!! his stomach is like an bottomless pit!! however tough he looks, most of his decisions are emotional! :) a damm caring person and he will remember even the little things u tell him!! all the best to u angry man! :) u will scare people (until they get to know you) wherever u go ! :P  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apurva-mudgal">Apurva Mudgal</a></p>
<p>Gunde' i still remember the first time i saw u in the queue for room allotment (SAC). Little do i have to mention, that your robust personality, generated a sense of initial fear in me. I remained nervously quite with you until, the first time we spoke. But the deadly idea i had fictitiously created about you, vanished soon. Your gentle, polite and low-pitch tone, clearly redefined you as a very decent & caring gentleman (though its a now proven fact that being the GUNDAA and funnily scaring people around in the hostel is  your fav past-time) . 
You were the first 1 to bring a laptop with you in the start of college. I distinctly remember the days we (bellu, varun, me n u) sat and enjoyed movie or funny videos (from dc) sessions. Frankly, i guess i have seen more movies in your room than in my own ;) Then of course song of our first year together ... DIDDI DIDDI !! and boulevard 
i enjoyed those long stretches of playin fifa 10 and 11. Hardcore Liverpool fan! I have seen you sacrificing anything at all fr watchin even the most predictable matches. 
Rachit is dedicated and hardworking, especially when it comes to what he loves. Im referring to his active involvement in the celestia. Very enthusiastic about photoshop and web activites. I had a gud time reading his blog once in a while. 
Theres a lot more I can add, like our 2 road trips and what an integral part you wer of those trips ;) You r helpful, kind, generous, adjusting  and hardly ever get angry. These were gr8 3 yrs out here and hope theres still more fun to come in the last yr ;) Cheers for life<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuj-rao">Anuj Rao</a></p>
<p>First I met you was during Celestia meeting when you were the secretary of the club. When I had to give my lecture in front of Celestia core members, I was very nervous. But you gave the strength to give that lecture as you were continually listening to my lecture. Your attention really motivated to give the lecture completely :D You have been very helpful since then. You took Celestia to new heights. You have guided me whenever I needed it. It's been my pleasure to know you and work under you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Though we had known one another few months ago..after interaction,i wished that our acquaintance could have been in the forst year itself, because i missed that fun!!!!  :).Jovial and a person to hang out with.Nevertheless, your continues smile on face is what differentiates you from others.Keep smiling...And all the best for your future!!!!  :)

<p>Multi talented and passionate are the things that come to my mind when i think of Rachit!!!!!......simply an awesome and a no-nonsense  fella........has an intimidating physique which he uses to scare off people :P........but is actually a very polite and  grounded person........his love for sylvestor stallon  and Liverpool  is unbounded......his passion and dedication towards extra currics  is amazing......and his hardworking attitude just rubs off on others.....his web designing skills are simply amazing.....,.....not many know that he is so well versed with his comp skills that just  his typing speed is close to 70-75 (yes, 75!!!) words per minute.........a pro gamer (i enjoy every minute of playing FIFA with him :D)........he tries a lot to make PJs even more sasta with his special inputs :P.......well actually sometimes he succeeds as well :D.........always in life,be as dedicated and hardworking  as you are about Celestia.......and trust me,  no one can ever stop you from acheiving greater heights. CHEERS!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-verenkar">Akshay Verenkar</a></p>
<p>Rachit, the man! From a weak looking guy in 1st sem to this macho man (good enough to give others the 'don't mess with me' vibe)........what a transformation! 
It has been a great pleasure knowing you! Highly talented and just equally hardworking - now that's the kind of quality that deserves to be called RARE! He's the kind of guy who keeps everything clear and gives messy stuff not a chance to mess with him in any form and that's one thing I've always tried to learn from him (but in vain though :P)! The variety of things he has done and the way he carries himself is simply amazing! One thing that defines him is his attitude - I know what I've been through and you can't even handle half of my stuff!! \m/ \m/
Simply love that attitude and that's a tight slap on the face of those who have no work in life! ;)
Having you as the coordi of Celestia and working side by side as the sub-coordi has been a wonderful feeling indeed! :D  
You'll go a long way and will continue to rock your world, only that your world gets BIG now! ;)
All the best dude!! Keep in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Rachit is a really awesome guy. He is always calm and composed and maintains an aura of confidence around him. He is the kind of person you can talk to about almost anything and everything.  He is really like a bro to me. In a party, he would be the guy holding a glass of wine in one hand and entertaining a large group of people with his interesting stories. It is always nice to talk to him, mainly because he is always down to earth, simple, open and you can always be yourself when you are talking to him. Diligent, talented and yet polite. It is hard to find people with all these three qualities, but Rachit is perhaps one of those few guys around here who have them all. He is great qualities of leadership, teamwork and passion towards what he does, no doubt he was a really successful coordinator of Celestia. I wish you a great and successful future! Keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Rachit, the GUNDA, my neighbour!! I still remember our first meet, u were bandaged on ur right elbow... that very impression of urs thrilled me in n out!! But as the time passed i realised i was wrong about him... never go by his looks!! he is rather very kind hearted, down to earth, zero ego, ready-to-help, always stands by u in any situation at any time.  He is really the one upon whom u can rely with ur life.... (don’t take it literally :P). He is hard-core Liverpool fan.... (never seen such craze in any football fan). He will sacrifice anything (be it studying for his finals!!) to just get a glimpse of Liverpool’s live match. He has great passion for the things he does. His best habbit is, he always looks at bigger picture, which many people lack, and acts accordingly. The two most valuable things i learnt being with him are, “if u have it, then Flaunt it.. (u know what i mean ;) :P)” and most important is, “never stop working hard towards ur goal, even if u fail thousands of times!!” sometimes his hard-work goes in vain, but he always takes it sportingly n works even harder... thats what i like most in him. He is very gud programmer as well as pro-gamer... i can still hear ur shouts, when u used to score in fifa :D :D.. those will be the memories!! all ur bdays were awesome (rather, they were other way round ;))... :D
Though i call him gunda, but all those moments spent with u were full of awesomeness. Had a great time together man!! Wish u very gud luck for ur future.... keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nilesh-bhala">Nilesh Bhala</a></p>
<p>"abey gunde , yeh testi accept nahin kiya , toh ... " , =P . Man if u have this guy next to you , then you bet yourself you have the greatest support on earth ( physically , mentally not quite yet :P ) . Just kidding , he really doesn't like to joke around all that much , coz when it is a serious issue u got be a 100%. I still remember the day , i crashed the car and this guy got all angry and pumped went almost to bash up the other driver , luckily for him there were many ppl to stop him , but thats exactly the support i am talking about . Extremely true at heart , a little sensitive and an amazing human being. He has his likes sorted out, and am sure he is going to do wonders with it . ! Man does he have the best taste in music or what ( extremely pathetic i mean :P ) . but i am sure u'll gradually improve , and some day u will reach my level of taste in music :P . I just wanna say that I am sure u'll have a rocking life ahead , and keep in touch. Cheers man ! =)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-das">Varun Das</a></p>
<p>Rachit, I remember those EG days. And how I used to copy your answers. He is one of the quiet guys and mostly called a "GUNDA" by all other people. He has been always very helpful to me. Now, we share a common interest for designing. We just have it in our selves. You are an amazing designer. Just wanna wish you a rocking life ahead and I know you are gonna have it. Best of luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>Awesome person to be friends with......attends almost all classes, and most of the time looking at him you will find him all serious n all, but he is a total fun loving person, all the class masti was fun with you around. He was the one who took physics society seriously and may be coz of him we today all in the physics group are  enjoying so much. All the best bro for all that is to come. Always be in touch man. U will be missed.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Rachit !!  The kind of person who does wat he wants n doesnt bend to wat he needs to do. Whenever i listen to ur name, i always go back to our MT2 days. I'm sure u ll never forget 'em :D ! Nice and supportive guy, the cordi of celestia who entirely changed its pace. Its been totally active after u started leading it, I always used to hear one thing or another. So, a great leader and a good friends. Never seen u picking a fight with any1, cool and composed. Its been fun to be around with u, and also, a savior in the MT2 journey :P :) !  All the very best bud, keep in touch :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/k-surya-kiran">K Surya Kiran</a></p>
<p>Rachit Kurukshetra!! :p You do remember thats the name I used to call you by, back in the first year. I must admit that i have had a varying set of opinions about you. But i think i have finally settled with one and i think that indeed is the correct one. I find you to be a very straight forward guy. Thinks straight. And inside that raw-muscle-powered body of yours is a gentle heart. A gentle and soothing persona you have been, its great to spend time with you, time slows down and one starts floating in free space on hearing that signature calm and composed way of talking which is so yours. Its good to have you around mate. Keep in touch buddy.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>

<p>Rachit is one of my great friends. Great to talk to, great to be with. Likes Computers a Lot. I can undoubtedly say he is one of the most hardworking fellas of our campus. And yet you would never know how much he has worked until you ask him or someone tells you. had great times together, lots of laughter, lots of sad faces together, and lots of knowledge exchanged. All the best , Stay in touch !!!! :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/souvik-dutta">Souvik Dutta</a></p>
