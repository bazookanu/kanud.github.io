You can hear and see Rachit from a mile away. Very expressive and spontaenous, a child at heart!
He always aces his subjects-be it MOS or Finance. He never fails to help someone in need, the big hearted clown!

<p>I completely agree with both of them above :P , Rachit is a perfect example of a good friend whom you can really trust upon,he's always present when u really need some one to help you out, some times(in fact most of the times :P) irritates with his scholarly phrases , but a great person to work with, on the whole he is undoubtedly one in million!!!          <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-jaini">Aditya Jaini</a></p>
<p>This person's USP is his Million Watt Smile !!!!....and you can't help smiling back!!....if your day is going bad, count on him to irritate you more with his lame-ass jokes :P :P ...he's one of the most hard-working and enthu people i have met till now....one sure thing i can say about him is that - you can count on his help, academics or otherwise....all that said, Rachit is fun and am truly glad to have met you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-repal">Neha Repal</a></p>
<p>Rachit R Maheshwari is a good person. He is a very good friend and really good person at heart. He likes to help his friends. The best thing about him is that he keeps no secrets and is very open. He is good at giving useless advices ( :P ) and has been given a certain tag (you know ;) )because of that but even in those good advices, he is letting out rays of his bright personality and his sober nature and that is the greatest thing about him. I wish him a great future and may he become a fine successful man.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Rachit Maheshwari...they don't make people like you anymore..and it's sad really. Rachit is the happiest person that you'll find on this campus. Always has a big smile on his face.Always ready to help out others. He has mastered the art of living. He has his own ways of doing things,like table hopping in the library every 15 minutes,but they seem to work.Rachit has phodufied all eco courses, and I'm pretty sure he'll do the same with CS next year! I can never forget your encounters with Aniket or your epic quotes("Kya hua uncle??"). 
Rachit, never change the way you are, do not loose the happy go lucky attitude and keep smiling!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>Rachit.... - Whenever you here some important news about any event or any other stuff going around on campus from someone you can easily guess whether its this guy who has brought it to everyone's notice...  A guy who can be spotted from any where in campus... Has his unique style and gait... Very kind of heart... Full of expressions... Always HAPPY and SMILING (battishi dakhvat everytime... :P ) An extremely hard working guy who spends long hours in library Really works his ass out..... A person who looks at everything in "ECONOMICS" way... .. Has his own unique way of doing things... Always ready to help others whatever it may cost him... A lover of Finance I must say and gets crazy when the topic comes to financial matters.. .:P ... A very down to earth person who always wants good to happen to others...  Also many a times he is irritated with something or the other... Be it sleep, or acads, or assignments, or someone.... A confused soul many a times.. (Sometimes pessimistic)  But even out of it... he is one of those people who always waits for those golden opportunities and EXPLOITS them like hell... A very thoughtful person who takes any decision only after thinking over it in detail....  A very gentle person at heart ( Doesn't say a word even if a LOT of jokes have been cracked on him :P)  One who always loves to advice people.... My Monginis Buddy.. who always is ready to come to monginis even though he has been there 10mins back..(Lemon Tea being his most favorite beverage... Can drink it for 5 odd times in 50 mins  :P). Rachit is a talented person who works extremely hard and earns his GOLD... Thanks rachit for being such a great friend.. May you be blessed with all that you want in your life ahead... I hope that you will be a successful person in life ahead... I am truly glad to have you as my friend... 
PS : Meet me at monginis in some time... :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>I first met Rachit just one day after coming on campus. He was raving about how great everything is, and how MSc. Maths is what he wanted. My first impression was "Man this is one cool guy who knows what he wants and works to get it." 
I have to admit I was wrong. A week later, after the 5th iteration he was shouting about how great MSc. Eco is. 
I daresay that no one will ever be able to "figure-out" this guy completely. Forever restless, insanely clever, extremely impatient and totally crazy is how I would describe him :D
I won't ever forget the time he defeated me at chess ten times in a row, having proclaimed he was going to do that! A great AoE player too. And I have never seen anyone breeze through anything like he breezes through Economics. One of my "PS buddies" too. We had a load of fun at Thermax, pulling Prathamesh's leg :P
Bottom line, Rachit is an one of the best friends I made when I came here. Cheers mate!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>Unique in every walk of life (his walk is also unique).He will always be "changi" no matter what the circumstances are.I know Rachit since 5th :D and for the last decade the 1000watt smile has been a constant.A hard worker and a sincere student he is still a child at heart.His enthusiasm has been an inspiration for me.You will definitely become a successful person.mate.All the best wishes :)

<p>Rachit! Rachit! Rachit!
He is an ever smiling person! His help towards others has no limits and he always wishes good for the other's sake. He has a keen interest in Economics and Finance and is always pumped up about every practical thing.
His smile is so infectious that even if the joke isn't that funny, his laughter itself sets me rolling into fits!
It is said that laughter increases your life span. If this is true, then our Rachit is immortal!
This library dweller is has been a great friend, and I wish him all the very best for his future!
His trade mark 'Li8...Tension nahin lene ka....' makes one feel good at heart.
I wish him the very best for everything he strives to do in his life!
Cheers,

<p>A guy whos always smiling, no matter what happens. A truly wonderful and amusing guy, its fun talking to him. You can always spot him in the library with his green bottle. He is one of the nerds of eco batch. Full of dedication and hardwork, i am sure he can reach greater heights. Good Luck!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Rachit....naam hi kafi hain!!!! This guy is the sole reason why my BITSIAN life has been filled with sooo much of fun and laughter. Never a moment goes by with rachit that he is not doing something hilariously stupid :D (dil pe mat le) . Something very unique about rachit is his wonderful attitude. Nothing can get him down ( except losing a game of AoE ) , he will always have a smile on his face and faith in his luck when facing any adversity. The lengths he goes to achieve this are a constant source of entertainment ( namely fART of living , sometimes even playing 'gayatri mantra' to improve his luck etc) . Another peculiar trait of his is his sleep. It's like he dies for 8 hours only to wake up to a new life. Bang his room door at 3 in the night for 15 minutes and still this guy doesn't wake up!! His mixture of hindi and marathi has changed the way I will speak hindi drastically, unfortunately for the worse. Anyine interested in making a quick buck may challenge rachit to sing the lyrics of ANY one song , and that too only the starting 4 lines . He has memorized the economics 'shit' like he was born with fundas of economics in is head , but he CANNOT sing even the first few lines of any song :D . Anyone who visits his room is bound to notice his cupboard and walls ( apart from the huge heap of clothes, books, boxes, 'ghar ka khana' , biscuits, shoes and an occasional rotten smell ;-) ) , which are stricken with notes depicting his life goals . What I like the most about rachit is that the acts out what he thinks. He will never be deceitful or unscrupulous. Sometimes,he acts even before he thinks , something that would have definitely put me in a hospital bed for a few months when he was about to push me playfully while sitting on the edge of a railing (thankfully I stepped down just in time) . All in all rachit 'mast bandha hain' , 'dil ka saccha hain' , 'maan mein baccha hain' . Never change dude. Hope you achieve all that is written on those sticky notes of yours , and in case you get those 1024 crore rupees, yaad rakhna 2 peti mera hain ;)  Have a great life!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>
<p>Agar yeh nahi hota toh har economics class kitna bore hota!! He has been the constant source of entertainment and inspiration for attending economics classes. Rachit always carries an optimistic attitude with him......"koi nahi, sab thik hojayega"! Also he has a habit of addressing every one around him as pro....even if a person is just sleeping or going for a bath, Rachit calls out "pro hai yaar tu". He has very keen interest in economics and responsible for increasing the average of the class :( If you want any entertainment, any time...just ask Rachit to ACT NORMAL!  and what to tell you about his room.....epic _/\_...no place to even step a foot. All n all rachit is very helpful and A great friend to hang out with. Rachit  wish u all the very best and i hope you become an entrepreneur as you have always wanted to be!! :)

<p>The first thing that i remember when i think of Rachit is his million watt smile...always puts up a smiling face..(at times i wonder if u ever have a bad mood :P...!)..
he is very helpful and sincere about his work, always in library...so much so that the library has no existence without him :P ...
he makes our economics classes interesting...wen people will be dozing off in classes..his questions will actually make u wake up and listen..(though i have cursed u at times for your doubts at 10:55.. ;) ) 
an amazing person with a pure heart....it has been great knowing u.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruthi-srinivas">Shruthi Srinivas</a></p>

<p>Rachit...being in the same class i got to know him well only after our childish fight over a stupid issue...though i was very angry and ya unreasonable too but that innocent and guilty look on his face actually melted me and i realized I was wrong without him even saying a word. As said by others he is someone with a ever smiling face no matter what so ever happens..and tries to put a smile on every one's face too...extremely caring...understanding and a genuine person ...and actually has a capability to actually kill some one when he starts singing....song also thinks what wrong it did...:):)....am really glad to be a  friend of your's  because its really fun to be around you and laugh on your stupid jokes even when I am hell tensed....always keep smiling like u do now, and don't u dare forget me anytime...stay in touch...:):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/divya-gupta">divya gupta</a></p>
<p>Rachit i must say has a very positive attitude towards life when others complain about mess food he will praise it "yeh aacha hai ,voh aacha hai ,sab aacha hai" ,others curse their profs he will respect he is that kind of guy who can survive in any condition you put him in because he is always satisfied and has very little demands.He is a person with strong will power and full of confidence .He is the chaos agent both literally and figuratively  you see his room  (entropy is infinity ) and then his ability to change others thoughts (kal pakka surprise test hoga tujhe attend karna hai to kar ,yeh question pakka aayega padh le). Rachit always has huge stock of home food (this might be his only distinct Marwadi trait :P)in his room and he never hesitate to share it  thanks for your khakra and garlic toast buddy.Rachit is a pro chess player i will never forget the hours of heated argument we used to have while playing supply chess.Rachit has a real bad taste for music will always irritate you with his remix and horrible horrible hindi songs (he can top fufa but cannot recite even 2lines of a song correctly wtf..).
When it comes to exams he becomes superstitious he will wear different color of sweater on different occasions  .It was always  good to have you around buddy , will miss you ....Good luck<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raman-ladda">Raman Ladda</a></p>
<p>Rachit brightens the environment around him with his striking voice and his distinguishable smile(or rather laugh :D). A jolly person with a big heart makes everybody laugh(sometimes unknowingly), does not take offence whatever you say to him. Dedicated towards academics -- evident by his library trips (or should i write dedicated towards library :P, donno what). I will always remember our "tu toh pro hai yaar" conversations. Best of luck for your future plans.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>
