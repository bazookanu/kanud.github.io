<p>Though i met her just about 1 year back..Raga is 1 of my best friends today. I still thank my luck to have ended up in the same batch as her in deco lab.. which brought about the beginning of our friendship.I can always rely upon her to accompany to mess/mongi etc. Raga is one precious friend to have. She'll appreciate u whole heartedly when you do well at the same time.. she'll rebuke you when your going wrong sumwhere. From deco to micro to analog to quark'12 she has been with me at my best n worst times. I can talk to her about anything under the sun..be it career,friends,studeez,teachers... there's sumthing about her which makes me feel my frequency matches very well with her. Her silly jokes in bacher's class..which make me laugh so much in front of sir itself :P My journey through 3rd year wouldn't have been the same without her. Inspite of not having known each other earlier..I have very beautiful memories spent wid her. Talking endlessly for hours on sum non-sensical topic... going to NC to drink loads of coffee just the night b4 compre :P n den celebrating the end of exams! :) There are few people that God makes to bring selfless joy into others' lives. Raga is definitely one of those people :). Brilliant that she is, she manages to strike a perfect balance betn studies n extra curriculars.Whole heartedly dedicated to whatever she does. An active member of Nirmaan too! I'm so glad u took ps in 1st sem Raga..we'll have many more days to gossip about teachers n cry about exams :P.. Hope we end up at same ps stn too!! Have a lovely future.. I know u will =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/niharika-tiwari-">Niharika Tiwari </a></p>
<p>RAGA!!!!!!!! Raga is truly hardworking, dedicated, and sincere in anything that she takes on. She is extremely intelligent, fun loving and caring person. I actually feel lucky to have a friend like her. Both of us share many common hobbies too!! like watching movies, sleeping and cursing Gautam Bacher and his subjects and all that.. :P.. The funniest part about Raga, according to me, is her sleeping habit.. the maximum time till when she can remain awake is 10pm!! lol!! But the thing which i really appreciate about her is her zeal and dedication towards her work that makes her get up early in the morning at any time she wants to!! Raga is extremely helpful and was available to me whenever i needed her.. be it academics or any other thing.. i relish each and every moment which i spend with her.. and i wish her all the very best in her life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/barkha-gupta">BARKHA GUPTA</a></p>
<p>ILU(this is her nick which a very few ppl know..) She is one of my best pals. She has always been a shoulder to lean on in my tough times.. everybody wud be talking abt her sincerity, hard-working nature....as she is always known for these great qualities. so let me keep them aside :P She always stood beside me when I needed her :) ..
I m sry if i hurt u sometimes but it was bcoz i felt u as someone special with whom I could share anything( a few exceptions.. nd i m sry for that tooo :( )  I m gonna miss u like hell :'( nd I m gonna definitely kill u if u dont come for waves!!  Hope u get everything u wish for in ur life nd may u have a bright future.. 
 May our friendship last forever;
May I sail upon your sea.
May we go through life together;
May there always be a "we."
May I be your endless sky;
May you breathe my gentle air.
May you never wonder why
Each time you look for me, I'm there.

May we be for each a smile
Like the warm, life-giving sun;
Yet when we're in pain awhile,
May our suffering be one.

May we share our special days,
The happiness of one for two;
And if we must go separate ways,
Let my love remain with you.........This one's for u.. (copied :P :P neways u noe that i m not a poet ;)  )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/karnati-chethana-reddy">Karnati Chethana Reddy</a></p>

<p> If i have ever got any good scores in my whole of 3rd yr cdcs, most of the credit goes to this girl for always giving me the notes and helping with assignments. One of the most helping natured gals i have ever met in the college and also a very sincere and brilliant student.

Never says no, if she can help other person in anyway she can. One of the toppers of my branch and also batch, I hope she continues this marvelous journey ahead in her life and wish nothing but the best for her :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>
