<h1 class="page-title">Raghav Bansal</h1><p>Intelligent, honest, fun loving, trustworthy, this is Raghav for me. To add to his charm, a very good friend, and I must say one of the best I ever made. He's an exceptional sketch artist too, man! seriously I love his sketches and I would not be surprised if one day he has his own art gallery. Professional, a very hard working guy with good ethics. He has taught me many things, the most important of all - how to maintain a good friendship and how to do your work without being affected by people around you. Many people come into your life has a lesson but only few as a blessing and for me he's def. the latter. I wish and I am sure he will reach greater heights in years to come and will have such a pleasant and wonderful smile forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>I used to identify him as the Physics pro in my first year. Thought he was the typical nerd but I was really insane to even think about it. I got to know his versatility the following year, and boy does he make awesome sketches and write beautiful poems. Never have I seen a more down to earth personality and his nature truly sets him apart. I still remember cracking jokes about how he would trick people to get free pizzas from Dominos during our college fests. Will always look back at him for being who he is and I hope he achieves all that he desires in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>Raghav Bansal ! This name brings to my mind an intelligent and hard working guy. An awesome guy to be friends with. Makes awesome sketches. I remember when he showed me two of Anne Hathaway's sketches he had made and he asks me which of them was better. I was like "What ? There's nothing better here. Both are awesome ! " :D A good keyboardist as well. (Listen to him play the Titanic). When it comes to monetary matters, "We've got a badass over here ! " :D I hope you keep up the good work forever. Stay in touch and have a great life ahead :) Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>

<p>A dedicated, calm hard-working Mechanical Engineer. Raghav always has some nice workshop going on in Quark. He is conceptually sound, and down to earth as well.

<p>"Show me the money", that is one line that only he and I can actually get the meaning off :P But here is an amazing guy who knows it all, whether it is being the finance coordinator for Quark or making beautiful sketches of Anne Hathaway or writing poetry that will simply blow you away. His simplicity and passion for the goals he has set for himself are commendable qualities. I'm going to cherish all the moments we had together, whether it was trying desperately to get a project in 2-2 or struggling with acads in 3-1 or even fighting over money matters in 3-2. I am confident he will have a great future because a person of his caliber deserves nothing less than that. Enjoy every moment darling because you are gonna shine :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Raghav Bansal. One of my very first friends in BITS. A true baniyaa i would say he is :P. Our Quark Finance Coordinator, har waqt "abe kahan se laaun paisa". Very simple living guy. He is an awesome sketch-maker & an amazing keyboard player (omg, he plays Nostalgia so damn good, being a fan of Yanni). He's a very hard working person. The guy who still, being in 3rd year, solves back questions of textbooks. He gives his 100% to whatever he likes. His mantra "ya to phod do, ya li8 le lo". He is a very jolly face & an ultimate entertainer, on the other hand, a very professional person. No doubt, he has a very bright future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>

<p>My first meeting with Raghav Bansal will be the incident I'll always cherish. No doubt that he has been an outstanding scholar right from his childhood. He is intelligent and yet, humble, because of which I admire him a lot. A person with a 'Never-say-die' attitude,  he is very passionate about what he does. Be it drawing sketches, writing poems. He can never sit idle, always strives for finding his hidden talents. He is a food connoisseur and its always fun discussing with him about it. Above all he is a very practical and down to earth person, hard working and inspires all to strive for excellence. I wish him good luck for his future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>

<p>Raghav is a very sincere and hardworking mechanical engineer. He has excellent oratory and presentation skills (we were in the same TRW group). He has very good technical knowledge. He has worked formally as well as informally under Waigaonkar sir which I feel is a great achievement. He has done an excellent job as the Quark co ordinator of DOFAM. I have seen him working hard at the food stalls when everybody else was enjoying Waves. I wish you all the best for your future, may you succeed in whatever you chhose to do!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>

<p>Bansal bhaiyya..!!! A very capable, intelligent, responsible and hard working person. But more than that, he's an extremely caring, sensitive and gentle person. One of my best friends among the 2009 batch, I will always appreciate him and look up to him for whatever he is. He is so sweet especially when he said to me, "Yaar, main tujhse door ho jaunga, main CH1 jaa raha hoon". I will always stay in touch with you bhaiyya.. You are like my elder brother and I will always cherish my moments with you. :-) :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>
<p>Bansal! He's one guy whose hard working nature beats that of everyone in the classes run under his name! ;)
He lives up to his name (except for this Quark though :P )! 
From a guy who would close his ears when he hears a swear word to the guy who handles everything coolly with a hint of humour in his work (always), I should say, he has transformed like none other in BITS has! He is this interesting combo of rock-hard determination, extreme simplicity, creative intelligence and genuineness! Maybe we didn't share good vibes early in first year, but then I realized that knowing you has been a pleasure! :) 
His poetry is something I admire a lot. They have the right combination of philosophical reflections and 'pure from the heart' stuff! The rusted nib that clears off the mind's rust! :) 
The sudden display of his painting skills amused me, just when I saw only the poet in him!
I remember that once we traveled by the same train n u were to to go a station in UP. My dad had come to pick me up and when asked whether you would like to get refreshed at my home till the connecting train to your destination arrives(which was like due several hours later), you said that you would manage in the waiting room. As I and my Dad started walking away, he remarked that 'this friend of yours has tremendous will-power'.......and i got my dose too....... 'learn something from him'! :P
That I've been trying to learn from him for 2 years after that.....but certainly not anywhere close to what Bansal has! Of course, he's a friendly and kind-hearted person who keeps his friends close to him! 
You'll achieve what you set out for! Just make sure your goals are big enough for you to spend time on!
All the best! Keep in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>

<p>Raghav is one of the most genuine people I've come across in campus. Its always interesting to talk to him about anything and everything. A hardworking and a diligent student, he possesses a keen desire to learn about new things in life. Also, he is a very skilled artist. One can easily go head over heels over his sketches. My mech buddy, I've spend some really good times with this guy and It gives me immense joy to be his friend. I wish you all the very best for the future.

<p>Bansal! A very nice guy and a great friend but i came to know him well in 3-1 only as we both dint know a damn about cdcs and so used to study together sumtimes. When i first met him in 1st sem, i thought he was a nerd (no offence bro, u r way far from that now), i mean 8p and all, but in 3-1 i got to know him well and he is completely different than i thot. He is a very fun guy, coordi of DOFAM and all, but i dont know that personally. The thing i know is that he is very nice guy, ready to help nytime (especially during exams) and makes too awesum sketches (that one of vito corleone _/\_). Remember me bro. For that, remember our night b4 consys online exam (yaar pakad me nhi aa rha, bahut chhota hai :DD). I hope u achieve big things. U have an awesum luck for sure bcoz i dint even dream u wud make it this far :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/snehil-srivastava">Snehil Srivastava</a></p>
<p>A very simple person, very hardworking, and dedicated is what I know about him. Din get the chance to know him personally, though i m pretty sure with  the qualities he possesses, he can achieve whatever he wishes and can come out  with flying colors. Wish u all luck :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Raghav .... Finally i got a chance to write abt u.. sach bole tho bura na mana!! . A very hardworking person and is highly passionate and dedicated to his work. Basically, he is a nerd but is always ahead to help others. He is one of the selfless persons i have seen in this campus. He is a self claiming leader for his contibutions for Quark :D. Also a very good ( Damn good) painter. I still dont get how some1 like u can paint that greatly. He has a unique way of speaking to people and convincing them. A great talker. Keeps on talking even if has nothing to talk. Strong Head i must add :P. It was a great pleasure working with you and its really good to know you. Keep in touch and all the best for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-gupta-akirala">Tarun Gupta Akirala</a></p>
<p>Artist, Thinker, Innovator, Hardworker, Intelligent..yes all these are the average qualities for Raghav Bansal. But one fact that I came to know is that He is also a lover. :P. I have spent my three years with Raghav slogging through the mech life, but each moment being special on its own. The moment of sharing a dominoes pizza to being coords of the best fest on campus, from AOE to Prize Money hassles, Raghav has made each moment more memorable and fun.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ritwik-seshadeo-sahoo">RITWIK SESHADEO SAHOO</a></p>
