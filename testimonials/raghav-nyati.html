<h1 class="page-title">raghav nyati</h1><p>mast maula is THE apt word for him.
 i first interacted with him in the cab from the airport to the campus, got to know him well during my second year. unbelievable energy oozes out of every pore of his body. restless, vibrant and an enthusiast! hes the best of friend that you could ever have. trustworthy, really helpful and caring. i still remember how he used to teach me MuP and ES2; however little he knew, but ensuring i don't go unprepared!  thats the level of commitment he displays for his friends. awesome fun to have him as company, he might embarrass you, annoy you but never bore you. 
he possesses an enviable flair in sketching and photography. and i proudly admit i have been one of his best subjects for photography ;D (he admits that too!)
he loves arty movies, De Niro esp! and i have always loved discussing such stuff with him.
proud to have such a crazy but precious friend. 
all the very best for your future Raghav. keep up the i-dont-care-in-your-face attitude; do not change for anybody! :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>raghav...... he is one of the funniest guy i have ever come across....very genuine....I dont think anybody can ever hold any grudges against him.......

enough said,......
some of his special qualities-   very specific about his hairstyle....loves to bath twice a day...!!!......plays awesome guitar....knows everyone from their first day in campus.....never asked any1 for prom....
he didn't send 7 times friend request to the same girl......never uses sites like omegle.....
let me clear this once and for all..... "he left DoPy BY CHOICE"
well he claims to be from Noijja..... but I seriously doubt that!!......

he is the type of friend who will always be there for you no matter what happens..... always ready to help....

<p>“unexpected”  is one word that has the whole of Raghav in it. You can never know what is coming next from Raghav. I never figured out why he comes to me for studies because I suck at my studies as much as he do. :P You may not have good impression of him if you are just know him. You admire his humbleness, modesty, carefree attitude, shyness and his commitment to friendship only when you go on a walk with him. You know his all-caring attitude behind carefree face only when you listen his heart talking you. And believe me that cant happen at mongi.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshvardhan">Harshvardhan</a></p>
<p>NYAT!! He's a great friend, you'll get that from anybody who has known him for over a day.He's really helpful person and also  goes out of his way to help others. Whenever you're sad or feeling low go and talk to this guy he'll cheer you up in no time. Always with a smile on his face, he always looks in the brighter side of things. For him no problem is too big, no situation is too bad, he'll always say " areyy, kar lenge yaar, tension kyun leta hai'"  He is super talented, great at paintings ( although some of them are too abstract for me to understand). He is also a great photographer, all the trips that we've had, the pics have always been from his cam. While others will be busy posing he will be patiently clicking photos. I always admire the zeal with which he continued his ábhigyan' commitment . Nyati you are a gem of a person, don't change. I've had some memorable times with you. Stay in touch<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>Craziness defines this guy!! Full-time hyperactive, always smiling and making others laugh (though often by his lame jokes :P) Nyati is the guy to have around if you are thinking of doing something really crazy. My name-sake brother, we have been friends ever since we first met during the first year Maths I classes. Extremely passionate about his interests, he is one hell of an artist. Very frankly I am yet to see anyone wield charcoal with such dexterity and produce scintillating sketches with such finesse. His charcoal drawings really inspired me to try to imitate him (though without success :P). I remember calling him up odd times in the night whilst I was doing some sketch and was having a problem about some random feature or the other, and he'd come running to my room and just tweak a li'l bit here and a few Nyati pencil strokes later would make a helluva difference. I think it's the artistic eye in him that can point out very minute flaws and that's what makes him an even more special at what he does.  A very good person from the heart, he's someone who'd go all-out to help anyone in distress. I really cherish the friendship that we share and hope that we remain friends for life. I wish that he never stops drawing and most importantly retains his smile and his craziness and his passionate self forever. Hope he achieves all that he desires in life!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
