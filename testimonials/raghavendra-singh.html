<p>Raghav is the 1st person I spoke to at BITS and one of the best friends I have ever had. He's very simple and very well mannered. He's very dependable - someone you can always turn to in case you need anything. He'll go out of his way to help you out. His room used to be our common room in our first year :D We must have spent countless hours over there listening to his wonderful selection of music. In fact, his LAN radio is one of the best in campus :) 4 years isn't long enough to know a great guy like Raghav. Wish you great success in all your future endeavors!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Raghav is a simple, innocent person with truly strong moral values. You can count on him to stand strongly on what he plans to do always ( whether that be to take li8 or to attend every class :P ). Raghav was one of the first person I got to know in Information Systems and since then we've been together in the ups and downs of the 4 years of college. I doubt I'll ever forget all those times we spent together discussing the future and what lies ahead.
Best of luck for the future and may you always achieve what you set out for.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>Calm, Cool, Casual, Composed. Raghavendra could be described in these 4 words. He is always calm and composed and has a very gentle behaviour. He is a simple and honest person. I wish him a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Raghav's one of the best friends I've had on campus. He's a total movie buff and a gaming addict. Although I must admin that his and TB's Arkham City conversations have pissed me off quite often :D. I doubt I've ever seen him lose his calm. I'll always remember him for his "Superman" hair curl.  He's always good at what he does and I believe he'll achieve everything he sets his mind to. Wish you the very best Raghav!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neil-dhruva">Neil Dhruva</a></p>

<p>Raghav is truly a wonderful person! His friendly demeanor, his positive attitude, his cheerfulness and his patience make him an awesome person. Especially his patience. I cannot convey in words his calmness in the face of some of the most fiercest and loudest arguments and debates we have had inside and outside his room. Apologies for that! And thanks for being a wonderful friend and sharing those brilliant moments of classical Hindi film music! Best Wishes!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>

<p>His Royal Highness Raghavendra Singh Mahiyaria, as I call him ( :P ) is definitely one of the best friends I've made in these 4 yrs in BITS ... You would be hard pressed to find a more simple, humble, well mannered guy in this world ! A truly wonderful person who is always smiling in the face of biggest difficulties. There is no pretence about him. Well, more about his life.. I seriously envy his skills in organizing the music collection on his laptop.. a fan of old classical music .. He's a gamer to the core and a total movie buff ... His calm composed nature is reflected in almost everything that he does... and at last his trademark curl of hair ( a la superman ) perfectly sums up his character. I wish we always stay in touch and create many more memories. Best of luck for your future. Enjoy and keep smiling.

<p>One of my best buddies, I admire your friendly nature,calm demeanor and your tolerance for my jokes :P. I think you're the only one with a natural 'Superman' hairstyle. Wishing you a wonderful life ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-shirbhate">Sahil Shirbhate</a></p>
<p>Behold,  This is a testimonial for his royal highness, Sir Raghavendra Singhji. He is one true patriotic king both in conduct and in spirits. Everything that he 'owns' is kept in very high  regard including his subjects (read friends) while everything else is useless and must be discarded :P. I am pretty sure if he comes to political power he wont ever let India be ashamed :D  He is part of our famous corridor quintet. He entered BITS as the truly humble and innocent guy , my opposite facing neighbor, and his outgoing self wont even be remotely close to  that :P Raghav is very fascinated by new things! Be it a new operating system launch, a funky website or a new notice on the notice board! He gets super excited about it and makes  sure that everyone gets to know it first, from him :D. For Raghav , opinions are binary extremes and decisive (for a while, until they change again soon :P). Its either too good or too bad.  However if anything 'Indian' exists in the balance, then that side is sure of approval :P I have never seen Raghav angry! He either shows that ever smiling face combined with the  Superman's hair's "tui" :P or that pretentious sad face :P His likes are pretty varied , most of which have been influenced by us (English movies, songs, games,manga...) :D He loves old Hindi songs,L.O.T.R (The best movie ever made ? :P ) and pretty much everything Indian really . Worth mentioning is his love for Jungles and Hills where , if given the chance, he would live for his entire life. I don't see how that will happen seeing his hatred for other animals (ok dogs :P). He will ever regret being in "Info Sys" though I am pretty sure he wont regret certain aspects :P Right from the beginning,  We've enjoyed a lot teasing him about the desert land Kota :P and him coming to terms with it :P He has been one big help for me for the numerous times that I never requested, just  asked him to do things. Also, he has withstood many of my mood changes and still came back the next day with the same happy demeanor and  a characteristic "Ishaaaaaaan!". That's  how an ideal friend should be!  "The_One" and only ,Raghavendra Singh Mahiyaria .Will miss your company, All the best for whatever you plan to do!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>
<p>Raghavendra! One of my oldest and closest friends on campus, Raghav and me have shared some crazy times together. Most of those involved laughing at/with (mostly at) Sahil though :P. With neatly comber hair and a conspicuously clean room, this Rajasthani is calm, intelligent and can be quite persistent. For instance, he still believes in this peculiar notion that Kota has water. (last one I promise :P). Although he has never been too fascinated with IS, I still believe that he has the makings of an amazing designer. In all the time I've known him he's always been eager and willing to try new things. In the last 3 years he has seen more movies, played more games and listened to more music than his whole life before that. He has seen pretty much every movie I have ever recommended.Its been a pleasure re-watching all the classics with you.This has set the base for some of the most interesting and engaging conversations I have ever had. We've spent hours, nay days, discussing manga, anime, movies games and music. I will never forget those crazy conversations where we speculated about Naruto,  dissected the Lord Of the Rings and stared at each other with bulging eyes going 'MASS EFFECT!' . We even have plans for our own epic game which by the way I am still keen on making. I don't think anyone else has or ever will conquer as much unfamiliar territory as you have in the last few years. I'm sure that wherever you go next, whatever you do, you will conquer it as well. Best of luck brother. May the force be with you ;) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhruva-t-b">Dhruva T B</a></p>
<p>What can i say about this guy.....very magnanimous...very warm....somehow you get a hint of the true rajasthani aristocratic feel by just looking at him......one of the first Information System people I met on campus.....Most cherished memories with him include the frantic EG drawing right before the EG practicals in Teny John's class remember raghav?? :P will miss you a lot man best of luck...!!

<p>Dhruva introduced me to Raghavendra aka Raghav aka the_one, as far as I remember and because he is from KOTA, a fellow rajasthani, we soon became good friends. He's in true sense a good guy and a very good friend. I still remember he used to come up all the way to my room (his room on ground floor and mine on top floor) to ask me for breakfast, dinner, walks, etc. Great guy to hang around with. A Naruto, Mass Effect, Price of Persia, Assassin Creed, Black-ops  fan to the core, and without any doubt hes among the top gamers. To add he's a calm, composed guy with very clean and tidiest of room I have seen here in BITS. I wish him all the very best of a great, wealthy and healthy future ahead :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
