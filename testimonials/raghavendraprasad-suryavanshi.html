You have the ingredients required to be an entrepreneur ( like me ;) ) .You are the first person who helped me out TO SETTLE MY RIVALRY with seafood....thanks for being with me with all the time.....finally a quote is pooping in my mind(this one is for u raghu) "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction". friends forever \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-tyagi">Akshat Tyagi</a></p>
