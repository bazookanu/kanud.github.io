<p>SHAKKU aka Rahul Radhakrishna pilli!! is and will always be the most uniquest person i've ever seen in my life!! First time i met him.. he was this fat chunk!! I thought he was all about the food!!But he turned out to be more than that and he has shrinked down and we share the same weight now.. YOYO!!  Der was a reason we called him shakku and the reason is *** **** **** *** ***** **.  His heart is a like an open playground.. not only that all his friends can play on it.. but when he's a little high, even the guy on the next table can play on it!! The most innocent guy i've ever seen! We share common ideologies, sense of humour, common IQ's (thats what the world thinks).. but actually we are 2 very smart people. Did you come late for an exam? not as late as Shakku! Did u score bad for an exam? Shakku is der for company! Did u screw up sumthin? Not as bad  as shakku! Are you having a bad day? Story of shakku's life! Talk about his rashee!! And specially for me, whatever stupid thing i did.. shakku will be there with his counterpart.. so u understand how we work :) But inspite of all this he never ever fails to put a smile on his face.. Or even crack jokes! We have spend the 3 years of BITS making and breaking numerous amount of pacts to save ourself from being mad fun off, for mutual entrustement, mutual sharing of defense tactics. I will never forget the numerous amount of stories this guy has given us to laugh about and the vacation stay @ his house! He is also a great guitarist and has a major in the Cminor chord :P !  But because of his modesty, he never plays it in front of people. Really gud at business tactics.. his mango juice business is par excellence. I will never foget the day we got tired of calling people to go out, so just packed our bags and went on a road trip.. jus 4 of us.. hoping to get a pulsar.. but had to satisfy with an old passion plus (financial reasons). An amazing actor! Shakku has a knack for giving good ideas in mime meetings ! He has been the central roles in many of our mimes. A great basketball player but lazy as hell to get out there and play!! Had always been my companion while playing it in our first year. A very funny (but efficient) badminton player.. coz most of the times he's in the air! Keep all this aside, you want to go out somewhere and you want company?? Shakku is ready as hell! Very trustworthy guy (except when he's high don't count ur secrets on him).. good driver.. he has taken us to a lotta places in his blue lil maruti 800! (which was almost suppose to be under police custody)! Always eager to go home, but 3 days past.. and shakku will call me "Charly.. im bored as hell, lets go out sumwer." He is a main threat to the chicken in the world. A violent fan of chicken biriyani! Always eager to try out new things.. I will never forget all the nite outs, the discussions, the pranks, the bird-watchings and what not! and im gonna miss him a damn LOT!! so much for our bits life together da!! but sure as hell will hang out in cochin!! n U always be hu u r!! never change!! PS. danku for giving me company whenever we're being teased... :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charly-poul">Charly Poul</a></p>

<p>One of the most innocent guy..dats shakku for you, Oh sorry Rahul(even he forgets that most of the times). A bit lazy("bit" is not the word) but a guy with high potentials.An awesome Basketball player, badminton buddy and best buddy for bunking classes(MOS,EG etc etc). He is always be there if its a matter of outings or road-trip. He is known among the gang for his immense love and care for "chicken". He plays a major share in making "SHAHI DURBAR" a big success.He cant keep secrets(both his and other's as well). So its not a good idea to share intimate secrets with...:D.He is an excellent mime actror and plays a major role in where the club is today. He is a pure hearted person who still doesn't know to lie. He has gifted me with many sweet memories like ni8 outs, workshop visits..:D, "How are we gonna die??" stories, visits to AH-4 to help charly with the sounds for mime( everyone knows how that went) etc etc.. he is an "alien" fan. Talking with him is always fun. he will enlighten you with his childhood stories of how he kicked a "GIRL", Shake-hand story( cant go into details) and goes the list. But actually talking with him over phone is much more fun. It will be like 2  people talking random shit. You talk about something and he would be listening half here half there and gets exactly the opposite of what you say. He has a characteristic way of getting up. If you ere a sound "aaahheeehhee" when you call his name from outside then you ain't be any Sherlock to guess that he just got up. Apart from all this he is a gret guy to hang out with and 1 more thing ... Always be sure when you walk with him..nothng bad will happen to you because you are with SHAKKU..every bad thng will happen to him only...:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>Rahul a.k.a shakku is one of the most innocent and absent minded persons I’ve met. There is nothing in the world he loves more than shahi’s chicken biryani. The only reason shahi still runs on campus is because of the single handed effort of this young man XD He’s also an awesome actor. It’s always a joy to watch him on stage. I will never forget his ISRO scene. I still smile when I think about it! He always willing to make improvements after taking our opinions and put on a good show. He’s also incredibly lazy and tardy. I always take his case when he acts irresponsible and misses evaluative labs etc. but that’s only because I care. Huge fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and lover of all alien documentaries. For the past 3 years he’s been with me as a mech dude. We had some brilliant times together. The outings to bogmalo, doodhsagar, gigified, paintball, veega land, harry potter etc. are unforgettable memories. Really sad we won’t be spending another sem together, maybe if we are lucky might end up in the same company located in some tribal area :D Will miss you da. Keep in touch!   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Shakku!! The guy with the Rashee! :D I'm actually surprised you remembered to put your actual name in your profile :D If u have a bad day, go to shakku and your day is bound to get better! :D Studies hard during the day of the xams (:P) and everything other than what he studies comes in the question paper! Talk about Rashee! :D You cant help smiling (or laughing) when you look at him, with that innocent face and the absend-mindedness :D Future generations will study about how chicken became extinct in this world after shakku was born :D A fellow KFC and F.R.I.E.N.D.S lover! :) A 'pro' in basketball and even more 'pro-er' in football and badminton :D Was fun playing with you.. Your stories about yourself are too good, esp. the mango juice one and the ones about your infections (infatuations) :P :D The guy with the most infectious laugh in our group :D You were an integral part of the mime club and the waves mime :) Lets rock the waves mime next sem also :D Enjoyed these 3 years with u \m/ esp. during the tantrums u threw when drunk :D Dont worry v'll get Nehra's and Jadeja's autograph someday :D Man u r an awesome guy! :D lets rock next sem also and being in mech, hope we end up some place good.
