<h1 class="page-title">Rahul Anand</h1><p>As usual I will start with "how I met him (Rahul)" I guess one of those old sunny days when we used to have CS/IS meetings I met this guy. A good guy to the core, fun loving, mature attitude, to say the least a handsome guy ;), these are some of his magnetic qualities that would hold anyone for a very long time. Hard-working, studious (was not in this category before 2nd year, don't know what happened :-/ ). Extra-curricular seems nice too, has worked for CEL for two good years. So overall he's A+ on my friend's list and I wish he would reach out to the stars in years to pass. All the very best for the road ahead  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>One of my best IS buddies... :)... An extremely hardworking and dexterous person... One of the very few people on campus who has a Mac as well as a Blackberry.... and even though is humble enough and down to earth not to brag about it... :) My project partner.... (Had some awesome moments doing the project with you vishal and varun) ... One of the people who have the knack of doing things their own way with wit and intellect to come up with a solution... An extremely cool headed person (although gets angry at some profs... :P You know who!!! :P)  A person generous at heart.. If you have an empty wallet, surely the first one to approach to... :P Always helps others and makes them happy... Oh.. and how can I forget those moments rushing along with you to monginis and back in between lectures... Rahul is a sophisticated chap with cool sense of sophisticated humor I must say.. !! An expert Android programmer... :) Has been doing some awesome projects.. A fun to be around overall... Has a heart of gold... very tough one though... Thanks dude for giving me some awesome moments that I will cherish throughout my life.. !!! All the best for the future and I believe strongly that you will win laurels... :) ...
PS - Lets go to monginis tomorrow between the DBSA and SE class... :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>
<p>You've been a great mentor in my project. You are a great person and an exceptional coder. I know you since 1st year and since then i consider you as a good friend of mine.
Have a great life ahead, and best of luck for your future endeavors..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Rahul Anand - aap Android Dude hai !!
One of my dearest "non-engineer" friend. :P
This guy has immense maturity, a heart of gold, a macbook and also a blackberry, but still not a shard of arrogance and flashiness in him. His pastime includes finding and comparing new gadgets from the latest slrs to the latest smartphones to what not.
I have had the pleasure of knowing him since our first semester. He seemed shy at first but believe me, once he starts talking you'll find it hard to shut him up. What a great 3 years this has been. From the occasional morning badminton sessions to pulling all-nighters for android to all the time spent in your room(the IS-hub), it has been a barrage of moments to be cherished.
Here's a toast to all these unforgettable moments, many more to come by and to your glorious future. May the force be with you !!



P.S - Abe, maine testimonial bhi likh diya. Ab toh pending treats de de !! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
<p>I met him in 2nd year. But soon became one of my best friends in the campus. I like his punjabi accent when he speaks hindi. He is very caring, calm & down to earth.  He is very modest & always ready to help others. He is cool headed but sometimes gets very angry.  A highly organised person, he has one of the cleanest rooms in the entire college. I am glad to have you as my friend. I wish you all the best for your future  endeavor.. Be in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>A brilliant, talented, hard-working, calm minded, macbook-owner, stupendous, mind-blowing (literally), showoff non-engineer!! These are some of the numerous adjectives for my friend. One things, he failed to learn throughout his stay in the campus, is, to get angry. If somebody feels that he got angry, well then, that is his normal reaction. He is an extremely talented coder, which does not show in making small codes :P ... but in the long run, he beats most of the people. He has a very sophisticated way of doing work, which scientists are unable to understand. But soon, someday his mystery will be unveiled, and we will get to know why he is so special. Not that I am boasting, but his close friends will agree with me. Also he is a very caring person (there are many instances to support this argument). In his future, he might be one of the big personalities, that we will be proud of being friends of. But till then.... "Lite le, kaisa hai yaar tu??!!!". God bless you, for your future.. be in touch.. :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyesh-shrivastava">Priyesh Shrivastava</a></p>
<p>He's kind of a person who complains i never went with him anywhere but accompanies me everywhere in campus.One of the cool dude who never takes tension though gives others a bit :P his room is unique..it is always open and we make it a point to peek or get in his room every time we get out/in the hostel.What else can i say about big people with "Mac", it was fun spending these 3 years with you..May u have a gr8 life ahead Farewell :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>rahul...rolly i call him..sometimes rolls .He's a brilliant person... One of the most logical people i've ever seen , short tempered though :P ... Man u seem often offended by my comments/double meaning jokes or whatever but i never meant to hurt ur feelings (but still 7 am !! seriously??? :P ... just kidding )... He's one of the very few ppl with whom i feel comfortable .... often accompanies me to monji , bog, and i like hanging around with you...i still remember the evening tea i used to have in ur room in  the first yr..you have the most organised room i must say...stay the way u are ..keep in touch and all the best for future :)

<p>The Android Partner. I don't think I'd have ever met him had it not been for Android. One of the most hardworking people I've ever met, It's been a pleasure knowing him for the past semester. The Night Outs, Tea in his room, Mongi Treats, the four finger scrolling and Discussions about his love life will be greatly missed. Attends all classes, fun to irritate and eversmiling. A Guy your mom always advised you to be. Wishing him the best in life. (and his love life ? [:P]) Chal Mongi Ab =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>  Almost  one year has passed  since I met him at PS and thought …really this guy is from my campus? However Rahul’s status in my life changed extremely fast from a stranger to a close friend… which can be attributed to one fact…  both our needs to talk nonsense all the time! :P He is a patient listener and right from day one has always listened to my tales uncomplainingly, replying intermittently with his trademark “acha”… Rahul is always jovial, is always joking around and probably is the only person who can laugh on absolutely anyone’s jokes. And though I know I am going to suffer for this , he is one rich kid… who loves to flaunt his ware… his world famous blackberry and  mac are examples. There are so many incidents with you that I can never forget… for example the guy I threw off his bike in luck now when I opened the door of your car too fast… ( by the way I still feel guilty about it )… the group discussions at PS on topics we barely understood…your list of crushes which has to be revised every month :P .. us as a group… our shahi dinners… our awesome amboli trip.. me and anmol messaging you back and forth from the other room…the very horror movie like atmosphere..and the little things I say to piss you off… oh! They are the very best of my memories.. I really hope you will stay in touch..( and will always keep listening to my never ending saga of troubles), and will remain just as friendly and cheerful as you are! Cheeeeers to you my friend!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>rahul.... i came to know him in my 2nd year during GAN classes... even though we didn't spend too much time with each other but in that little time, he became one of my best friend... i likes his company..... he is one of those friends with which I can share my feelings at any time....always remains happy... n make others too..rahul..it's fun being with u in these 3 years...will surely miss u next sem... hve a great life ahead.... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-gupta">Siddharth Gupta</a></p>
<p>Given that we're in same branch it was little weird that first time we talked was in a sad PS1 station. Since then it's been great knowing this guy. It wouldn't have been same without him in PS. Random Dominoz outings, Jatropha ka tel nikalna, FIFA khelna, movies dekhna, conference room mein baith ke duniya bhar ki bakwaas karna, IIM L ghoomne jaane ki planning karna, uske inumerable crushes count karna, those were some really good times. Even after PS, it's been a fun journey. There are few things about rahul that are just so unique, he's always there to give you his own assignments(COA codes :D), always ready to have  a chai at mongi, always ready to show-off about anything possible from getting good marks to buying a fancy pencil, always ready to go out with friends, always ready to fight with you(always looses, credits: his stupid arguments :D) . He's a kind of guy you can always count upon. He's a super sensible fellow, always nice to talk to. I hope you get whatever you want in your life ( iPhone, iPad, ipod touch, iCar etc etc).   cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>

<p>Rahul Anand...the dude with mac and blackberry  and guess what the guy is a huge android fan and developer :P   one of the most sincere, hard working, talented person i have ever known... A person generous at heart ... if you have any doubt in acads or if you need money he is the guy to approach, but it comes at a cost, you will make you walk around the campus everyday listening to his boring stories :P... apart from this the guy is huge federer and alonso fan.. will miss watching the early morning tennis matches and F1 races with you...sasta MAN U supporter... came close to him in 2-2 and he has been a awesome friend since then ...late night maggi,tee parties with milind and parth...t1,t2,compre preparations...all-nighter coding for assignment submissions ...infinite mongi nescafe moments...man i gonna miss this

<p>I remember seeing you for the first time outside some extra class for 4th iteration people. I thought Kitna khadus hai :P And then I found him in the same situation as me in Physics along with <a href=” http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/143”> Pika </a> I finally had a friend in IS and who owned a ThinkPad too :) Love teasing him with “Management toh tere genes mein hai :P”, ridiculing him on his singing (he sings very very bad) and enjoying his duels with <a href=” http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/19”> Milind </a>. A hard core Federer and Alonso fan, his knowledge of tech stuff is simply superb. He is very logical in his thinking and has a great business acumen too. Awesome in coding too, be it Java, Android or Verilog. He has been my partner in all assignments and projects right from 2-1. Sorry for leaving you in Android (Felt bad, but then we wouldn’t have discovered <a>Shivam</a> :)) How can I forget FIFA ….. Those endless 1v1 matches and 2v2 with Nikhil and Arpit were just too awesome. <br><br>Thanks for all those songs you introduced me too, Nesci ki Maggi and Paneer Puff too :P My college would have been incomplete without you and <a href= "http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/19" >Milind </a>. All the best for you future mate and hope we get the same PS station :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Disclaimer : Don't kill me after reading this :P becoz i can't lie :D

Even after being in the same branch and attending (read bunking) classes for 1 full year we actually met in 3-1 when actually everyone in the class was just attracted to his "blackberry". And I thought what a show off he is (which I still think although aajkal kam karta hai:P). Later on, came to know him as a pro coder( Verilog, JAVA), intelligent and smart batch mate. He can actually talk to anyone because he just loves talking. Be with him and you won't be bored for hours (ob half of the time he will talking about all sorts of gadgets which he wish to possess) .Talking to him just after the exam may scare you with all his comments on the paper.. "itna easy to tha." "av toh aaram se xyz (when I am getting xyz-20) jaayega". Well he is intelligent(that you can just see with the above examples :P). He can't be diplomatic and hence ends up being rude at times.He is helpful and makes you happy (by letting you know your marks :P). A person with great persuasion skills (he actually persuaded the whole of IS for Arambol :P) and poor acting skills. It's fun to irritate him and that's why we share more of a "friendship-hate" relationship. You might think that I get bored in your company but that's not true. I am sure you are gonna have a rocking future and all the best for the same. Keep smiling and Keep boasting about all your gadgets :P.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>
<p><center>Its Raul, its Raul and its Rauuuulllll!!! </center>

Rahul Anand and Vishal Sinha. My two best friends. The very first ones in the college. I just cannot imagine my college life without the two of you. I do not know whether i am even capable of writing something for you. By definition i should not believe in destiny. Violates causality you see. But then this is way too good to be a co incidence. I think it was destiny that i came to BITS as part of a last moment decision, it was destiny that you came to BITS as part of a last moment decision. It was destiny that we met in the common room during cincinnati open. It was destiny that you came to my room the next day and explain what are "Virtual processors" and how to connect to the LAN. If there is anyone whom i can say has seen all my colors, then it is you. Be it me in a terribly upset mood to an ecstatic-jumping-around mood. From being an arrogant prick to spending eternal bliss times during the night time tea sessions. You were always there. You have been there to bear my tantrums, you have been there to hear all my "self-admiring" stories, you have been there to listen me, from movie suggestions to philosophizing about how world is just a spectacle and all of us are actors. You were always there. Never complaining. I owe you all those moral boosts you were happy to offer {most of the times unknowingly ;)} in the times when I was down.  What can i say here, in this damn 100 word testimonial? That you have been listening to my balder dash all this time. That you have been loving me as a brother all this time. Its now, after 3 years and looking back at all the changes I have been through, that i realize that you had been my mirror. That i have been looking at myself all the time, that you have been reflecting all that i am, all that i was not and all that i could be. Thanks for being with me. Thanks for respecting me.Thanks for making me believe. Thanks for loving me.Thanks for everything. I love you Rahul and i will miss you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
