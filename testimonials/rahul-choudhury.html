<p>Rahul Choudhary popularly known as RC   is one of the litest guy i have ever known...  Always full of energy and life ...Looks like a typical mawali gunda. and yes also acts like one .. for reference check his farewell pics 
We first met in my 1st year working for Quark 2011 and have been friends since then.  Is an emotional retard... cries on every small things... Loves eating Paani Puri from Borkars... :P  He has been one of the closest friends amongst all the seniors i know... Very helpful.... You can always find him wandering behind girls or stalking them ( Biggest Tharki )  ...  Recently he got himself a bengali rasgulla ( u know what i mean :D) .. and now is very busy with his endeavors .   Altogether he has been like a brother to me .. always supporting me ...   All i can say is you cant find a person like him .. he is one of a kind..  
Best of luck for all your future endeavors  and keep in touch :)

<p>To start with, I met him in 1-2 and i hardly knew him then. But he seemed to be a very frndly person and mixes up quite easily with everyone. As i got to know him, I realised how caring he is and how deeply he feels everything. He is extremely well read and knows a hell lot of things which i cant even imagine remembering :P seriously, hats off to you for that :D his obsession with cars, bikes and babes is to such a great extent that he doesnt even thinks twice before expressing himself in front of anyone :P i really mean it, having experienced it :P but eventualy i got used to that too and now it seems perfectly normal to me :D We spent soooooo much time together, all our trips, vellagiri in campus, endless chats etc etc. All these moments will always remain an integral part of my life and m always gonna miss all the times spent with you :) I wish you all the very best in life and may all you wishes(:P) come true. And wish you all the happiness in life :):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Rahul Chowdary

Had known you from my 2nd year through DOFAM. But third year was too much fun with you mannnn!!
Those Quark Nite Conference room discussions and the many discussions,night outs that followed them were too good.
Talk to him for 5 mins and u will be entertained in the discussion, Such a lively person really :)
Can never forget the way you turned up all Colorful for the Quark CoCo deciding Meeting :D.
Saw many posts abt your Wikipedia Brain, Sad that i did not get to see it till now :P.
Man with a vision, Hard Working and down to earth :) are just a few of the amazing qualities that he has.
It (was,Nah) IS an honor having a friend like you, Thanks for all the memories. Stay in touch. And all the best for your future :) :) .

<p>One of the most 'colourful' (I hope you get my point :P) people I have seen in my life, Rahul comes across as a jovial guy armed with rib-cracking witty humour. He literally personifies the word "Li8" and lives it. Can make any party come alive with his catchy, hilarious one-liners hence his apt nickname "Raatein Rangeen" (no it's not for what first came to your mind after reading that nick :P). He is the epitomy of living life to the very fullest. I really enjoyed working alongside him for Quark and without him Quark sure would have been a very dull experience. I shall miss his characteristic gait and style of speaking and his insanely hilarious facial expressions which just evoke laughter at all times. Hope he achieves all the very best in life for believe me he himself dosen't settle (or should I say indulge :P) in  nothing other than the best. Stay in touch pal :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Rahul Choudhury aka "RC" is one of the most tharki and mawali guy i have ever met :P.. We first met after i was inducted into controls 

and he was my coordinator..the best senior under whom i have ever worked.. ulti emotional guy who starts crying even on small issues 

:P friend of friends and always there for you when you need him...gets excited very quickly and at the same speed dissapointed too.. 

baat baat pe iska j@@@ jalta hai :P..I have learned a lot under him..loves eating water balls(aka paani puri from borkars) :P and is 

one of those biharis who knows each and every punjabi song.. :P he has always been like a brother to me..always supporting... recently 

he found someone to stay busy with  but still he finds out time for us and for his tharkipana :P...thanks for always being there and i 

hope you remain happy forever..all the best for your life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-taneja">Nikhil Taneja</a></p>
<p>"Rahul, naam toh suna hi hoga", yes this is how he preferred to introduce himself in 1st year... He is deeply inspired by the ad which says "Scratch and Win" (you know what i mean) .. I met him in the 1st year and he has been a true frnd ever since, we have done a lot of things together like it watching "1 cd movies"... Sometimes he comes up with awesome one liners, "So what i'm committed, who says one cant look for greener pastures"... People refer to him as Wikipedia but to me he is a jabberer... DON'T go and CHECK his knowledge he'll bore you with all those information for hours.. He is extremely hardworking and he can work without sleep for three days in continuum... The most striking feature his personality is his ability to mix up with everyone and anyone... A crazy fan of political satire and aims to be a money launderer one day..He believes that every thief is a normal person till the time he is caught..  Jokes apart his determination and true dedication he puts in the areas of his interest is beyond measure.. I'm quite ascertained that this will take him way ahead in his life.. May you get all the milestone you deserve.. Have a gr8 life Choudhary, Best of luck for all your future endeavors...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>I still remember the night Laveena introduced me to Rahul aka RC (we were in same team back then in our 1st yr in Quark). I remember, during Quark meetings, he used to spill out ideas like anything and as Ramanan said "He's a guy who is always pregnant with ideas" what a line!! and seriously this describes him the best. To add, a good team player, bit lazy though, and a good passionate guy with hell lot of enthu. To say the least, he's a great person to hang out with and his best quality is his "one liners" damn! those ones can make anyone laugh. I wish him all the very best for a strong future ahead :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>Rahul choudhary... my inspiration and dunno.. even among my role models... for he had loads of knowledge which is never ending and which always amazed me... whenever we were together... he used to talk sense which he openly does too... we have shared countless nights talking and sharing stuff... which made me feel happy .... he's a geek to be frank... just deviates from his goals sometimes... which most of us do...not a biggie... but once he gets his mind on something... until the thing is done...he wont move a muscle... dats his motto... and dats what inspires the people around him to work along with and below him... he has an undying urge for money which he sure is gonna achieve in near future..he is a dreamer... always calculates 2 moves ahead and goes on to get those 2 moves in his favor.... he at times pisses me  off big time... and we quarrel... but afterall its a part of being friends.. ryt... and dats what makes something like friendship so special to one's life.. :) thanks for being my friend.. and hope u achieve heights which no1 else can...(Except for me.. :P i'll give u that much credit.. :D ) ..and always hope that we remain very good friends... for now and forever... the way i want it.. :)

<p>Choudhury........I'll try to write ur testi only in english (but u know some words are best heard in our matra-bhasha :P ) .....and dont correct me if i am wrong somewhere :P .....Now firstly never argue with him in english....u'll definitely regret it. He is an extremely talented person.......and wasted half of his talents after coming here. He loses his temper quite frequently......sometimes feel insecure...... he is extremely emotional sometimes (u know.....toooooo girly  .....hehehe).....always used to be deep down in his thoughts. He is sometimes annoying......but at the same time......always be the first one to say SORRY and i have said it bfore also......it take guts. He is quite hard working....and takes his future plans too seriously .....chill maar yaar thoda.....mil jaaega tujhe sab kuch BOSS D K  :P :P ......or haan ......agar mujhe 3 saal pakane k baad bhi  nai mila na to i am telling u......definitely u'll be losing some of ur body parts :P :P. Another thing .....he is the one who lost 20 kgs in last 3 years......but believe it or not ..... he is responsible for emptying the borkars most of the times. U'll always be one of my besties in college.....and obviously the time we spent together can never b forgotten. Dekh bandi to tujhe mil hi gyi h ( Committed ch****a ) ..... or jo sab bhi tu chahta h ....BMW ......paisa......naam.....blah blah blah....noone in dis world wud want ur wishes to b fulfilled as desperately as me ( 3 saal pakaya h bc ). U'll always be remembered whenever i'll look back at my college life. Have a gr8 life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anchit-saini">Anchit Saini</a></p>

I have full faith in your capabilities n i m more confident than u tht u will crack CAT n will be a successful Investment banker.I wish all the very best fr ur future endeavors...god bless u..u will be deeply missed...!!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kapil-aggarwal">Kapil Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>Rahul Choudhary, aka RC !! I am very sure that I am never gonna say good bye to him, he has always been there for me, and always will. One of the best seniors, he is someone I can make fun of, share my problems with and share a puff with. All my experiences with him were while working for Quark, and he was more of a friend to me than a coordinator. When he works, he aces everything. I will always remember making fun of spree with him, working for the expo, special nights and his words "Pela hai". He has a huge heart and is selfless, he'll go out of the way to help me. He's one of the reasons for what I am. Great general knowledge, great vocabulary and great ideas, he's probably the most capable Aurora and Exhibitions Coordinator yet. His fun-loving attitude and killer one-liners are in sync with his dynamism. He's my elder brother and I will always love him very much. Best of luck for a bright future and always keep in touch. :-) :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>
<p>That Ah5 d00d who seemed strange is RC ! The guy who is kind and happy at heart and stud at looks. This Bengali babu works a lot and the success of Quark 2012 is a true example of his hard work and sheer brilliance. I remember him working with me for Quark in first years, were we dint chat and get along well but then things have changed now, its been seriously awesome to be friends with you and learn a lot from you. Live Life Laughing ( be it with a serious grin ). We have played the game of cold war from the very first major events in college to almost the third year when we realized we shared the same thought process and the same philosophy. I just feel bad I dint work for Quark in my second year, it would have been fun working with you people and awesome juniors. To be frank, your decisions in first two years were wrong to me and so we had differences :P but now things have changed and we hope a good future. Man you had a vision, you had talent so you made awesome Quark and your work and your juniors speaks for your dedication.
Those Bogmalo trips or even zuari things we had, or even random NC chatups we had, I shall cherish them forever.

You remind me of that LIC Agent from Movie - Kahaani, 

PS. Those Rasgullas were awesome, I want them next sem too for awesome trips !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Rahul Choudhury, RC was very little known to me on campus till spree 2011. It is where we met and our friendship took off. Today I now have this dear friend with whom i can share anything personal or just gossip. This hybrid bengali has won the hearts of many by the dedication he showed in Quark (Though some of his plans failed miserably) He will always excuse himself whenever in auditorium (most of us know for what) and that is one habits of his that i totally dislike. If he is able to stop that habit of his, I am pretty sure that he can go distances in life. Very happy right now that he is not single anymore and though everyone is aware of his crushes very few know about his commitment. He is that kind of your friend who will ask you for help at the worst possible times, but will also be the first around you when times are not so good for you. RC - a true friend. Thanks buddy for being there whenever i needed and hope you have a great, successful and prosperous future!! 
All the Best!! God Bless!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>With so many testimonials written for you, and mostly good ones :P it is proved that you are a very friendly and helpful person! Didn't know him very well in the beginning, mostly through DoFAM i got to know this guy better. One of the best CoCo members in Quark, he has always heard me out through all the thousands of complaint i had ;) Remember that night when we went to the airport and drop Faridkot to Woodbourne? I think we became really good friends that day onwards. One of the most vella persons now that Quark is over, this guy doesn't fail to ping me the moment i come online! Anyways, it was awesome knowing you, do stay in touch! Cheers!! :) Tanmaya<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tanmaya-sanghvi">Tanmaya Sanghvi</a></p>

<p>Rahul choudhuy or "chudhari" is one of the most amazing person i've met because of quark.....a person who has such amazing vocab and sense of humor to pull it off so as to make it even more hilarious :D ......a big workoholic when it comes to it, but a bit lazy (funny when u used to talk to Brigider Joshi or sharma? in ur shorts and tshirt waking up a few min ago :D )......it would have been a boring quark for the CoCo and also the campus ppl had it not been for u.....had awesome fun on ur quark outings, esp the post quark outing to Cortalim...had such awesome fun..... Hope u achieve all ur dreams and more....All the best for the future....Dream Big and Live Large dude!  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/moheth-koppolu">Moheth Koppolu</a></p>
<p>Rahul Choudhury. People call him RC. All short and sweet. But I prefer saying tha entire name – Rahul Choudhury- has quite a weight associated with it. Ekdum bhaari it sounds. This man is always fun to chat with and there is never a dull moment when I talk to him- offline or online. Always keeps the conversations going. One of the most hardworking people I know, who made Quark Aurora Nites an amazing pleasure for all of us. Thank you! I really really admire the way he is always updated about various pieces of literature. His expanse of literary lists is huge and I have some suggestions of his to be read in my lifetime. His Kolkata tourism tips helped a lot. I still have some epic Park treet to-do things that I shall hope to tick mark soon. It is a pleasure knowing you Rahul Choudhury. Stay the same and wish you all the very best in your future endeavours and everything else!
