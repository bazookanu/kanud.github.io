<h1 class="page-title">Rahul Jain</h1><p>niagara falls ke level ke jharno ki zameen jabalpur ka dance guru lover boy rahul jain.
out of associations that we have had,the most treasured is DJ-night-baraati dance assoc.3 saal mein shayad hi aisa koi gaana hoga jispe hum ikatthe nai naache.:D.
he s a man of instincts.has minimal patience.
chemistry ka toh pata nai but mech mein God banne wala hai.thanks to his incomparable passion towards the Auto industry.He has a life long commitment with his jabalpur-buddy vishal ahuja.ikatthe jeene marne ki kasmein kha rakhi hai inhone...:D..Rahul is a fun guy to be around,possesses a really contagious laugh.
He s an adamant ass.tik gaya toh saala hila ke dikha do koi isko.I realised this on the netravali bike trip.2 baar gire bhai saab aadhe ghante ke frame mein...bleeding..scratched..wounded..par abhi bhi bike chalane ke keeda nai gaya...he says"yaar mujhe believe nai ho raha ki mujhse bike gir gayi...ab toh main hi chalunga"..i said"bhai u bleeding"..he replies Ã¤gar main chalunga nai toh main walking jaunga" and he started walking!!! blv it or not...we could not convince him to take the backseat.

All said and done,The times we had together...MT1 labs,Zephyr'11 dance,Dj nites,group outings have all been \m/ ..teri garam rum hamesha yaad rahegi aur over the top nautanki of getting a high bhi!...:D
All the best for the times to come...u r bound to go places with that simplicity!...cheers!

<p>Rahul- We have been friends since our Workshop, where he was my partner
and he used to do our all work there. Thanks Rahul for making those
workshop labs so easy for me :P

One thing I can say about him is his  passion for Mechanical.
He is very cheerful and freindly person,its always easy to start a conversation with him.
In all these years I have always seen him smiling, that I'll always remember.
Its has been a pleasure knowing you Rahul and i really wish you good luck for all your dreams. :)

<p>Rahul bhai, cant forget those ps1 days with you, playing basketball all day long and that 2 Km long walk to that hotel.

<p>Mr. Excitement aka Jabalpur. The most excited guy I have ever met. Cannot forget the dj ni8 spent along with him. Jiska naachne ka maan nahi ho raha ho vo dance kiye bina nahi rah sakta. Super fun to hang out with.   Passionate about cars, cars and just cars.  Long discussion about ye gadi sahi hai, iska design mein ye change kiya hai. Jabalpur ka debut stage appearance Zephyr fashion show. Thoda dhila hai par kaam kar leta hai. Photo kichwane ka bada shawkeen hai. His passion will help him soar him skies. All the best!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Rahul! I've come to know him only in our 3rd year and it was only in 3-2 due to our CE labs did we really become good friends! He's one of the nicest people i know! We've had some crazy times in CE, always the ground that never did anything and never got the correct readings! :P I still remember T1 and T2 time when we sat and studied for Bonding, we were trying to figure out short-cuts for every possible thing! Good fun that was! I'm glad i did get to meet Rahul, he's a wonderful guy and i'm going even going to miss our chem days when i think back! Here's wishing you a successful future! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>

<p>Rahul,one of the few guys with whom i don't mind studying together, i can't forget the days  trying to figure out what those copied slides of anjan means.  he is a fun guy to be ,always with a smile on his face. he was one of the first chemistry guys i met in campus and after that it was quite a journey, i still remember his excitement about the DJ nights,his fight with the bus driver, his fight with the bike renter, his obsession with cars ( for which he won't listen to anyone, he is rightly a authority in this field). he is a true mechanical guy, when some of us (including me) were confused about which dual degree to take in 2nd year he was sure that he wants to pursue his carrier in mechanical and from  2nd year onward waiting for the mechanical CDC's to start, now with 9 days remaining looking forward to study and learn mechanical from you in the next semester. i am quite sure that you will have a bright future in whatever field you choose , hoping we will  remain in touch. cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-khanna">Tarun Khanna</a></p>
<p>Rahul mast banda hai.He is the cool 'lite' freind who would disperse exam tension like hydrogen gas effusing through a tiny hole.Can't forget, kal pakka gym chalenge.Do din baad..kal toh definitely.Final equation- 2 gym days in two months\m/.Yaar your hometown Jabalpur has a special place in my heart.My beloved ex-freind/sister was from Jabalpur who passed away in 2007 fighting cancer.Would definitely visit your place some time.We know you are very passionate and would definitely go on to become a star.All the best to you,have a great life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raunak-sharan">RAUNAK SHARAN</a></p>
