title: Rahul Mathur

<h1 class="page-title">Rahul Mathur</h1><p>First of all you have to be the biggest ass in the world to delete my first testimonial by mistake instead of approving it. But I'm a nice guy, so here goes another. Since I'm not supposed to reveal a lot of things that could make this testimonial very interesting, most of you might want to skip reading this. Though he's my neighbor, we barely acknowledged our existence the first few months till a certain "fire incident" occurred. Since then, we've had a crazy time together, encountering all the highs and lows of college life. I won't forget the time, before packing up, when we had that late night conversation on everything from religion and politics, to Katy Perry's eye color. Or the daily Mongi sessions, gossiping and cursing at people. Or that time at Dudhsagar, when we all ran to catch the goods train, and only you managed to catch it, only to later leave it. The lazy nights at John's. Those arguments on who was the hottest girl. The acceptance that it didn't matter anyway. Then the wingman and brocode shit. Making elaborate plans on how to get a girl. The exasperation when you'd watch the 6th Rerun of FRIENDS during the exams. Listening to your over-optimistic dreams with a straight face. And how you're the d00d of Jaipur, with an even straighter face. But I guess I tolerate you cuz you're one guy who's always there, to listen to my deranged comments without making fun of it. Always optimistic(Av-10? A- toh lag hi jayega), cheerful, and down-to-earth. It's been one hell of a journey with you, with all the challenges, the dreams and the rewards, and I hope our paths keep crossing each other in future.

<p>Rahul Mathur is a story who inspires you everyday how important it is to be yourself.... Individuality is a virtue best learnt from this dear friend of mine. A very emotional and helpful guy, he is blessed with a pretty sharp brain too. Honest and sincere to his responsibilities, he exuded remarkable leadership qualities during his stint as DoSM food and HR coordi... his never say die attitude is worth watching.... Rahul gives everything he has in whatever task he takes up... fate is really beautiful for I have made some truly wonderful friends here!!!!!... wishing you success in every endeavour of yours... long live the bromance :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Mathur.. I got to know him in late 2-1 through Saksham & Abhiraj. He is honest and sincere to his responsibilities. He did very good job being Dosm Food coordi(because he gave me tr8:P).  It is fun to have him around. He always adds his funny points in any discussions we had.  He is the newspaper of the campus & always updates me with all the happenings in the campus. I am glad to have known him.. I wish him all the best for his future endevours... Be in touch.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Rahul... this is the guy who is the most fun to trouble, because his reactions to all things are so twisted and fun to watch.He has a unique ability to follow his heart on whatever he does.His hard work with the things he loves doing continue to inspire me. He is the one person who makes you realize how simple life is, not easy, but simple.
All the problems we mostly generate due to our prejudices, faulty mindsets are non-existent for him, or atleast he makes them appear so.
He will always be there when you need a friend, a person you want to take away your problems. He does exactly that. He has a unique sense of humour. It is only he who has the ability to control my crazy behaviour in public. I can't thank him for the numerous occasions when he has stopped me from doing something I will later regret. But at the same time he has equally participated in all the wicked plans we have executed.  He will always give you everything he can, never asking for anything in return. We share our love for old Hindi songs, which perhaps people have noticed resonating in their rooms at odd hours in the night when we are roaming the roads singing our hearts out. He will throw away what he is doing when you ask for his help. He is a deeply philosophical and its always a pleasure to listen to him recite the classic ghazals or his versions of those. Such a person is very hard to find, who will give up anything for you, understand the reason behind every one of your actions, and always caring for you.... For all the things you have done for me ... I love you Rahul....

<p>Bachche! You were always the good kid especially in front of tommy. You remind me of Rajesh Kuttrapalli of BBT when it comes to chicks! You always told me that apparently I was the only girl jiske saamne tu kuch bolta tha :P You’re the good, sane guy, who had his heart in the right place. Tommy and you were literally one entity and I’m not surprised you bagged the award for it too! 
Brilliant to work with, with a lot of good and rational ideas that came up during the festivals and an amazing capacity to get high and dramatize without a drop of anything but Pepsi. (They still did not sponsor us ? ) Though, the scene used to be hilarious! I would not stop laughing! And remember taking tommy’s case with songs on full volume at mongi?! :D 
Talking to you just generates a certain level of comfort, which, I think, is why we got to know each other in a matter of a few months. It was a lot of fun being around all of you – during the festivals and otherwise just sitting around on campus.  The whole bunch of you just manage to bring a smile to my face! If nothing else, DoSM gave me a chance to know a bunch of really good people.
Keep up your work, stay good, just like you are, get a chick soon! And very importantly, take credit for all that you do. All the very best for life! Hopefully, I’ll get to meet all you soon. ? 
Cheers!
P.S. It is not very easy to put everything into words for all of you. Some things are just special and are best kept to one’s self. ? All the times spent together is something which I will always cherish. It is a basket of memories which I take with me. Thank you for being a part of it.  --- Madhu Singh<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>He is the friend you would trust. He is the senior you would open up to. He is the guy whose ass you would want to spank. It was awe-fucking-some having fun with you for two years, DoSM can never be "work" :)  Now that you still have one more sem left and your wife would be elsewhere, we could have some quality time with Sam and Pinky ;) I hope you find your pinky soon. Wish you all the best for the future. Don't lose the "aa" for "ay"!  Neil Merchant, 2010B4A8581G, A.K.A Spank-Bwoy!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Damn it.. I was supposed to write testimonial for you first. Never mind, better late than never. Rahul Mathur. How do you define Rahul? Sheer confidence and honesty? A person who loves his friends and all those who matter to him, more than himself? The sharp minded? That outspoken sonavobitch? That daring, no-chudaap-straight-to-the-business guy? That guy who can recite any hindi song in a single go (including ek ladki ko dekha to..Thats a really tough one)? <br> I have always been of the opinion that the question of "Why?" is much more important than "How?". Rahul is someone who asks the question of "Why", he knows what he is doing and mind you he is damn proud of what he does and what he is. All his close ones know how he enjoys being himself and how he loves his life and all its parts (including us) and how he does not give a damn of others think. I do not need to say all of that again. I want to say how have I enjoyed all those Monji/Bogmallo/Gate-to-room singing sessions!! I want to  how we have changed each others' lives, to quote Good will hunting, "Who is your true friend?" "The one who opens up things for you", if I recall all that chudaap at Monji and all those discussions and all those "Tomar-plus-Rahul-pulling-my-leg-sessions"  and all the things which you said to me, on a serious note or in jest, have always opened up things for me. You have always reminded me and Tomar how important it is to be oneself. How important it is to stand up to your beliefs. You have always made things look simple to us. Sounds really filmy, doesn't it? But thats the truth. (Have to quote Gudge) For all that you have done for me, I love you buddy. PS: That look on your face- "I am Rahul Mathur. I am me. I am." :-* :-* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Rahul…Mathur….Kocka!!!!.... Loopy….. call him whatever you want … but no single word is capable of describing this completely. I guess he is one of the very few bits people who were known to me  before coming here, we met for the first time in coaching classes in Jaipur and man… has been heck of a ride since then :’) . I remember us getting along bcoz we loved to piss of one specific person there and we left no stone unturned to get to his nerve. So partners in crime kinda stuff :P . Then we came here and since then it has been going on and on and on and I don’t think there is anything left on this planet no matter how insane or crappy over which we haven’t had a discussion and every time, we have ended up laughing our asses off on the floor, rolling on the ground like idiots :D
Now describing the bastard, I dunno whether I’ll be able to do that but chalo lets give it a shot. Many ppl don’t know this but the ass we are talking abt is an amazingly sharp person with scintillating grasping power and amazing concentration ( if and that is if he forces himself and sits and concentrates :P). Memory… hmmm oopar waale BKL ne pata nai kitti TB ki hard disk thoos rakhi hai iski khopdi mein!!!!! Saala bhoolta hi nai hai kuchh!!!! Whether it be related to academics or any other random bullshit, u tell him something and it is equivalent to uploading it onto the high tech international sever and he is never going to forget it. Songs.. hmmm pick one and mind it, pick one and within minutes he’ll make u feel  “ are yaar , itti lines thhi bhi kya gaane mein???” and then u think haan.. ab khatam hua.. but the bastard will again come up with the remaining part of the song. We used to sing songs in Jaipur in the middle of the class ( sometimes loudly as well :P haha), we still do dat every time we go to bogmalo or any other beach and once back inside the campus… the talli walks J ;). Now when it comes to serious matters, I don’t think I’ll ever meet a more understanding person than u with such a vast and mature outlook abt everything. Whenever I hv been down and out, sad or confused, you have always been there to help me out with it in the most calm and composed manner. Man !!! people come to u in their bad times because they know that they wont go back like that. Ahhhh…. Tears… :’)
Now the FUN part abt the little fellow—always dances on DJ nites like a wild mad castrated dog without givin a fuck abt the way other ppl are dancing, trust me man, I never felt comfortable dancing like that earlier but when u  used to dance, it used to look .. u know so enjoyable and even I hv started dancing like an idiot and yes, the credit goes to u that I hv ended up embarrassing u :P. Never minds jokes being cracked at him, and makes the whole process bindass by coming up with the most idiotic fightback comments and all :P. Very very choosy with respect to what he eats.
Whenever u are down, if u know Rahul , then there will always be a hand for u to pick u up from the ashes and put u rolling back even stronger with extravagant enthu. I’ll always cherish the moments of madness that we have had throughout these 3-4 years and I’ll miss all the bird talks ;) . Without you, crying for no reason at all will never be the same for me :P. You have been a true friend to the core and sometimes more than that ( no pun intended )
I wish you all the success in life and frankly speaking, u don’t need my best wishes, u are bound to succeed. You might not feel that way at times but trust me, success wont come and kiss ur feet the typically orthodox way, you aren’t a normal person so I guess the same goes with success, it wont come in a normal way for you and it’ll be following an exceptionally different detour.
I’d like to end this on senti note, I really really feel that if there had been more people like you, then the world would have been a much happier place by far. I wont ask you to stay in touch, I know we will because I’ll still keep on weeping and need an agony aunt :P You are the awesomest person I’ve met, stay like that no matter what people say. Have fun buddy :’)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhiraj-tomar">Abhiraj Tomar</a></p>
