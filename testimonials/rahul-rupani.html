<h1 class="page-title">Rahul Rupani</h1><p>Gujju a.k.a Kalgi Boy (for all those who don't know, that's because of his hairstyle :P) was the most sharmila guy i had ever met. And now he has changed to this extent that he has lost all shame whatsoever!! He will always be the last one to get ready before any outing( he has too many shirts to try on!!). And what can i say about his self-obsession!! In case he has a camera in his hand, he will go on clicking himself!! He is a cheese addict( he can hate a whole state if even one restaurant doesn't offer cheese:P). One of the only good things about him is all the khakhras and theplas he gets from home!! Well, all these years would not have been so fun without you and your gujjuness!! I would highly advice everyone to go shopping with him once( he is brilliant at it :D). Will miss you a lot kamine :D (kisse main itni saari galiyan dungi ab!!). 
PS: Please change your hairstyle!! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>

<p>Gujju ! I remember when I first met him in the first semester and he had that typical gujju accent (now you know why we call him that). But over the years he improved his Hindi :D Well, where to start about this guy. He's a friend made in heaven. I remember having fights with almost every person atleast once. But this guy has never been into any with anyone ! Can you believe that ? Me being a marwari and he being a gujju, we share some common things. He's a businessman in the true sense of the word. Business is in his blood. But still he manages to handle acads well. An awesome entertainer. Countless are the number of times we've had unstoppable stomach aching laughs thanks to him. An awesome dancer. I remember the Zephyr when we danced together for AH4. And we rocked it (yeah we did bitches ! :D) When all of my other friends took C mess, he was the person to accompany me in A mess. So I got closer to him than others. An awesome sketcher as well. Just have a look at the painting he's made on his cupboard and his walls. And coming to looks, God must have taken a week off for him I guess :P Won Fash P for AH4 for the past two Zephyrs. What more do you expect ? Even had the chance to go further in this but circumstances weren't that suitable then. When it comes to pranks, he can be ideally called the Devil's Mind :P Ah, the list is endless ! In short, an all-rounder. Gujju ! I'm SO happy to be your friend. It's an honour. You shall rock the world definitely ! Keep up the same attitude and have a terrific life ahead. Cheers to a gem amongst friends :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>If asked to define this guy in one word I would say "mean". It is ironical actually because gujju's (he is a gujju in every sense of the word) are supposed to be sweet but then I think you can't expect your ex to treat you any other way.Still he is one of the people who cares the most about me or rather I say about my fitness or rather I say about my weight.Used to call me up at night to ask me to sleep and makes amazing workout plans for me like kayaking in palolem (thou that didn't happen) .He is one of those stubborn kids who refuse to grow up but then he is a cute kid so we put up with all his tantrums(and  because we are such nice people :P). Also the fact that he is a fellow food gang member makes him more tolerable Thou he is my ex but still he continues to be one of my closest pals.Always concerned and caring he is one of those people I know would always show up for me.Bole to apun toh hamesha hi dost rehne wala hai iss kutte ke sath :P. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>
<p>The first time I met him he was such a sweet and shy guy and he has come such a long way from there!! He probably deserves all the kaminas and other gaalis he gets :P He is like a little kid, so stubborn sometimes.He keeps thinking of all kinds of pranks to trouble people. He is a gujju to the core and so rich but he can make his rich plans of going to casinos and exotic locales with his only other rich friend/ex ( basanti :D ). He is excellent to go to shop with, I had that experience in mahabaleshwar!! He has been a sweet and nice  friend from the time we have known each other. We have fought and made up and laughed and had such awesome fun together! the party is going to continue and lots of amazing times are still to come! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>
<p>Gujju the universally accepted alias for any living being from Gujarat.Smart and dashing and obsessed with his looks and attire he is one hell of a DUDE.Popular amongst the girls he knows how to impress the opposite sex.An absolutely fun loving guy he is always game for an adventure anywhere anytime of the day.He is truly a 'shaitan khopdi',not at all interested in studies and god knows what does he want to do with his life apart from taking girls out every weekend :D.When i met him first i was fascinated with his typical gujju accent and even today it is a topic of joke amongst us.A gujju in the true sense of the word but when it comes to spending money you would want to think again thanks to all those trips he went to.But he is a very caring friend and though our floors are different that never was an issue,our friendship was way too strong to be hindered by such petty issues.He is no doubt a sweet and childish bvuayy with loads of innocence within him.His pranks are harmless and put a smile even on the intended target.I would miss the theples and bla bla stuff that he brings from back home.What an awesome friend he has been !! _/\_ _/\_...cheers to our friendship and loads of wishes for a bright and gujjuful future<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>Gujju! Hamara ek lauta beta jiski date of birth humse pehle aa gayi thi.. :D.. koi nai ho jata hai kabhi kabhar ! I remember meeting him in shad uncle's room, where i was able to figure out his native state by his accent, obviously.. Fir kya tha mujhe laga ye jamnagar ka hoga aur mere aage meri bachpan ki yadein fir sajeev ho utheen. par afsos ye sala rajkot ka nikla.. The one single guy in our whole group who is so much fussy about what he wears, how he looks.. he is the absolute authority when it comes to the matters of choosing which clothes to wear, which of the things go well with what and the likes. He is also concerned how his room looks and ya btw his room is one of the cleanest in the campus.. i must say :P and after that pencil sketch he made on his almirah in my (and ya jhaad's ) divine guidance, his room is like the ideal for others to follow. He is the odd one in our group of lazy asses.. as he is the one who is always ready and trying to plan an outing while we all are trying our best to sleep in our beds..anyways jo bhi plans iske successful hue hain .. they were epic and were enormously full of fun. his room is on the ground floor and near the stairs so whenever we go out one of makes it a point to kick it before moving on.. kya maza aata hai fir bhaagne mein.. iske dekhne se pehle.. All that said, this man is sure to find his way through whatever he chooses to do after BITS be it the fashion industry (thanks to him being a greek god) ya business-man in him is very much alive too (see him bargaining for something on the streets or give a presentation and you'd say so too)so no problems with that also. All the very best, kid, you have my blessings! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>
<p>Rupani...an awesome time pass guy. He is fun and a 100% gujju. I always enjoyed the time spend with him during outings, labs, small chats(mostly gossips and making fun of others etc etc..). I owe him  for teaching me hindi(atleast this much..:P) and frankly he is a good teacher..He never takes anything for granted. A guy with great enthusiasm and I wish him all the luck for future..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>A fun loving ,carefree and optimistic person.Rahul and I have been friends since we were in the same group for TRW presentation.I still remember how scared i was before the presentation and how he calmed me down and said not to worry.That time i realised we were gonna be great chat buddies :P.He is very cheerful and friendly person,its always easy to start a conversation with him.I must say he is an extremely trustworthy friend.He always has some really good songs and videos to share with me..N some of them have become my favourites too :) .I have spent a lovely time chatting with you for long hours (sometimes just talking nonsense).Its  been a pleasure knowing you Rahul and I know we'll always be in touch.I really wish you good luck for all your dreams. :)

<p>Rupani..!! I’ve known this guy for only about a year but we’ve become great friends ever since. Maybe it was our habit of doing chudaap all the time that helped this cause. Rahul is a very cool guy, never gets tensed and does his work too. I’ve never seen him lose his temper anytime, he’s a great friend. We’ve had a lot of great times together in the outings, (Kayaking in palolim \m/) and in classes also :P . Whenever I, Rahul & Asati get together, chudaap is bound to happen :P. We still have 1 year in common, nd this year is gonna be even more epic..!! I wish you success in whatever you wish to do. Best of luck..!!
