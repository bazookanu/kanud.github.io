<p>Rajshekhar , as I know him is a very hardworking dedicated but at the same time socially sound person. A diehard fan of Hyderabad .. every conversation with him helps you learn something more about Hyderabadâ€™s culture , food , IT companies , and so many other details too. :P  I got to watch some really good telegu movies because of him.. Special thanks for that. May your hard work and passion lead you to success , happiness and contention in your professional and personal life. It is really a joy for me to know an open hearted and frank friend like you. All the best. May you reach the zenith of success .  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>rajshekar mama. though i have known him personally for more than 4 years , we never used to hangout with the same bunch of guys. i always thought of u as a good , simple and cool guy. you never hesitated to help me whenever i needed. your post exam analysis of the av , etc has always helped me getaway frm the frustation of writing a bad xam :P. i njoyed the occasional gossip sessions we have .. you are a hard working ,dedicated  and determined guy. you plan ahead and u have a clear vision of ur career which only few can have. i really admire you for that. i wish we hung out more often and spend more time together. i sincerely wish u njoy watever u do and u achieve wateva u want ..  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>Rajshekhar Kilaru Choudary is one of the most unique person i have ever met in my life. He is my adopted son-in-law :D. He spends most of his time in my room trying to make me laugh. He is very helpful when it comes to academics and never hesitates to leave his own studies aside to help a friend. A hardworking guy, he aces all the subjects and tries to improve himself by challenging his previous records.He defends any criticism against the Chemical engineering department like a fierce mother bear :P. We have successfully irritated a bunch of people together. He is ever ready to eat in Shahi and loves the Chicken tikka biryani. Raju kaka is a true Hyderabadi and considers it to be the capital of the world. If i hadn't been to Hyderabad myself, he would have forced me to believe that it was better than heaven. He introduced me to South indian music and i will always be grateful to him for that. A true fan of A.R.Rehman and Harris Jayraj, he also happens to be an ardent Michael Jackson lover.  Although he is looked at by others as a naughty creature( :D ),he has the innocence of a child and i always have and always will welcome him with open arms. He is obsessed with Abhijit Joshi and stalks him :P . It always happens that we always have the same caller tune (coincidence). The second semester of the fourth year is going to be tough without him being around :'( ....  i will always cherish the sweet and funny moments we have had in these three years. I hope u will always remember me as your good friend. Wishing you all the best for your future endeavours.
