<h1 class="page-title">Rajat Koujalagi</h1><p>Rajat Koujalagi is a great guy with a fine taste. He is an awesome sportsman, specially Cricket and Football. He is the Rahul Dravid in Cricket and in Football, well I don't have much idea about the football players! :| Rajat is a good looking and dashing guy with a really high stamina. He is really great the timing and placement of his comments which makes them funny. He is the kind of guy, friends remember throughout their life. I wish him a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>One of my oldest and best friends on campus . Also one of the most principled guy I have ever come across . Man of his words as they say . Really respect him for all this . He is the kind of a guy who'll never let anything wrong or unfair happen .

Li8 kaafi senti ho gaye :P . 
As far as I remember , 1st and 2nd yr , our GTalk chats were flooded heavily all the time with all kind of bullshit . Discussing girls , actresses , "censored subjects " ;)  and on and on . I remember sending web links of mallu aunties and all time and again just to irritate him :D . Fun it was 

This guy plays really good football , cricket and badminton player but avoid playing in tournaments and all . We have shared some good plays and throughballs :) , always challenging fun to play with him . Cherish them all . 

Rajat'll be easily the one guy who loves DJ more than anything else . Cracks awesome jokes time and again , is an excellent story teller . DC mainchat days were also great , the fight we had against the ah5 guys on TITAN . Feel aa gayi thi :D .. 

Also the day when we were on the activa uphill in Netravali at around 6pm when suddenly out of nowhere a big monkey crossed us . Fat gayi thi seriously . FUCK BC BC MC BC CHAL BC WAPAS , we were shitting in our pants . 

It has been great time with you man throughout . Hope we dance again on stage someday like we did in zephyr :P . And although we dont gossip around too much , we share a good rapport . I know you'll make big in life :) 

Cheers

<p>I have known Rajat for a very long time now and it's been a pleasure having his company for the past 3 years. He is among the most refined and well mannered people in campus. But he really knows how to have fun when he wants to and has a fantastic sense of humour. The daring dance performance during Zephyr 2011 for instance was absolutely legendary! \m/ He's an excellent sportsman - cricket, footbal - brilliant at both. Despite all his gifts, he extremely humble and it's always wonderful talking to him. I wish you all the best for the future, Rajat. I'm sure you're going to do very well. :) Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>cheers to MUNNI and SHEILA...  u can't write this guy's  testimonial without mentioning them. He will always be there at every DJ nit ... till now i can't understand the reason whether it was dancing or OGLING but still he was always there. it seems it was just yesterday when we used to sit at the back benches of MOD phy class playing ( bollywood) and cracking jokes.
kudos to gtalk ... for endless CHUDAAP... now on some serious note.. a real hard working person.. almost invisible during exams.. happy go lucky guy.. never seen him complaining about anything, excellent football player. There's only one complaint.. for the last three years he has been suggesting crapy movies to me.. plz yaar last sem hain tell me some nice ones.
one more thing kettle wapas deke jaana.. oye bhul hi gaya tha (BIJLI ... yaad hain ??). wish you very best in your life ...  (GM now)

<p>Rajat is a cool, composed and entertaining guy and had always been the first one on the dance floor. Undoubtedly, the most enthusiastic guy on DJ nights, he manages his professional as well as his personal life pretty well. Sadly, even after 3 years I couldn’t get a good hold on his last name ( I hope u can understand ). He is a great football player and possesses a charming personality and at times seems to be quite ‘THARKI’. I had an awesome and memorable bike trip with him. I wish him a successful career ahead!!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>

A great friend who has always been helpful and adventurous. I will never forget all the football we have played together with our gang. Never forget ENI United with proxy-eni:BOOBA. We would always sit together in Bacher classes. Will always remember that guy, every ENI will for that matter. Very enthusiastic and fun loving guy to hang out, who brings the spice into the room. We will always be friends. Best of luck for everything!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>ONE special friend i have made and will cherish throughout my life. I wonder how i can describe our friendship in just 15-20 lines. To start with we have been friends since 5th std in school although we didnt used to talk and just knew that we existed :P . Our real friendship started in 1st yr when i saw him outside common room along with our another close friend Koustoov. This guy is one DUDE and i mean it when i say so. Has some crazy habits ( like not going for eating after his monthly budget is over ) or having 9pm-3am sleep sessions during exams. Die hard supporter of my fav club Barcelona and plays football exceptionally well. I admire his honestly and witty comments. Gives an average of >3 gaalis to me which i enjoy beyond words. :D He is a big THARKI when it comes to girls but good thing is he doesnt show that tharak. (sorry omi :P). He has always been a helping hand in my hard times and a good company during our bike trips which we will cherish for a long time. He is enthusiastic about what he wants he life and he has a soft corner for his close friends. I will miss our stupid hooting and crap pungi stuff we did in audi and I just pray that wherever you go omi, whatever u do, DONT change yourself. ( Daru ko hath bhi mat lagana mkl .. gand mar dunga ) .. tere jaisa yaar mein bigadte dekh sakta.. I wish you all the success and happiness in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amrit-mann">Amrit Mann</a></p>
