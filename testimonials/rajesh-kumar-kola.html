<p>One of the sweetest, most caring and extremely genuine people that i have ever met. You are someone very hard to miss in a crowd because of your sheepish kid like smile that you always have on your face.From our panjim bike trip,almost every day night canteen/ Ice and spice , all night gaming marathon during spree .. DOTA( its a lan game :P),fights or rather fight (no wonder we are so compatible) i will miss each one of them. I would like to add that all the wonderful and funny moments spent in your room bugging you while you play dota will be dearly missed :(.... . Your the kind of person i would like to say "I seriously do not know what I would done without you". Wishing you the best in life ahead. :) ---- Sharkk
