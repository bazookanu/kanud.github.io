<p>Sheth!! The Proprieter of 'Ladda Mathematics Classes' and 'Ladda Electronics' A champ with the electronic devices, he is never afraid to experiment(Tell that to his late lamented laptop!) Guy is simply a genius.No other word. Ask him a problem, show him the book, his fingers take the shape of a pizza holder stool, no pen required.The answer is out of his head. His Maths skills are Legendre. Sorry, i meant Legendary. Seriously. Had he been born 3 centuries ago, we would be doing Ladda Transforms, Raman functions, and the Raman-Kutta method, with M/s Bessel and Co being some laundry shop. He is a great person, a nice helpful friend-with a mile-long smile on his face. We'll miss you , Sheth, the chutney, the jokes, the smile, and the "Abe ob ae be". All the Best! :)) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>I wonder what I would do without him. A true Genius. The whole ENI batch owes him a lot. A person who is always ready to help with a smile, he is an ideal guy, a wonderful student. Sometimes, his doubts leave professors stunned with his brilliance. A truly professional guy. A great friend. Hope he reaches greater heights. Good Luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>How can i ever forget this guy!! Whenever in the future i would look back at my College life at BITS, I am sure i will always be reminded of the great Raman Ladda. When i first saw him and when i see him now, I realize BITS can do wonders. I think he is one of them who has got a complete transformation after coming to BITS. His calm and composed attitude always makes me wonder at times if he is human! He is the person who always carries that big smile on his face (which he finds unable to control) and walks like a true martyr. There are such a lot of events and stories associated with Raman that it is impossible to write them all  here (for such incidents you can subscribe to my "Raman Jokes" series). He is very very helpful and you will always find his room packed with people before exams all clarifying their doubts. People always tell me that Raman is going to kill me for all the things I have done to him.....those hundrends of funny comments, Raman Jokes and then the Raman facts, "Congratulations, Love You" quotes, songs that i made for you and etc etc etc!! But deep down he knows how much I respect him and it is this understanding between us that makes BITS life interesting for me. I am thankful Raman for the countless number of times you lended me money when i needed it, I am thankful for never leaving me hungry in your room, I am thankful for bearing all my illogical Raman Jokes and pranks. Thanks for all your 'slow' deeds that made my life interesting in BITS...A true gem of a person! Raman Ladda I wish you all the very best for all your future endeavours :)..."Abe-ob-e-be"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Many people undertake education, but only a few actually gain knowledge from it. Raman Ladda is one such person. Raman is a very zealous and spirited person. Not only he is the savior of the ENI-batch, but he's a really humble and truly a people’s person.
I know him since 11th ,where he was the most innocent and hard-working person in our class. And now still sincere and achieving excellence in whatever he does, but not so innocent after all. He’s really a warm  and friendly person  and a smile(kay mhantos mitra(i.e how r u my friend)?)  is always there on his face. I’ll always relish the countless  hours we all spent in your room doing nothing. I wish you all the best for your future and I know  one day you will own a big Electronics Company!!

<p>From writing exquisite poems in 'praise' of our esteemed faculty members to understanding most subjects better than them, Ladda is adept at these and many other things. Really got to know him well during 2-2 being sufferers of CaS and uP. Ladda is at his best when he venting out about our teachers, and having the same set of teachers for a year, i've seen that lot. His no nonsense approach to acads has many a times inspired us to perform better. If each corridor had a Ladda, even a mech guy will ace electronics. kudos!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jayant-dalmia">Jayant Dalmia</a></p>
<p>Ladda Raman Deepak ki jay!!! A pure genius and really hardworking person ever inspiring and always ready to help everyone. This guy actually does all the assignments bombarded at us. A model guy, focused on academics but also has a lighter side to him. Very easy to get along and friendly. Ever smiling and ready to face whatever life throws at him. Very sportive and humble and a great company. May you soar to great heights, but always remember once an ENI, always an ENI. Best of luck bro!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>Hmmm... where do I begin? As everyone knows, he is smart, hardworking, focused on academics and so on... But there is so much more to this guy than everyone knows. For starters - did you know he is an amazing sketcher? A very caring person, he is always ready to help you. And don't even get me started about his sincerity!  
He is one of those guys who will do it and not just talk about it. This attitude of his helped him grow in so many ways. He's a completely different personality now, and yet is as happy as he was ever.
I'll always cherish the times we spent together, be it on campus, in journey, at PS1 or so many other occasions. Some of them hilarious to no limits... some of them equally emotional. 
Ladda - you are an amazing person and an awesome friend. I don't know how my college days would have been without you - and I certainly don't want to know. Thank you for always being there.
All the best for the buddy for whatever you do!
