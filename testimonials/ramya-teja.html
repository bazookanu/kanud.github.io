<p>Tejuu! I gave her this name and I'm glad she loves it. She laughs at anything and everything! She is a kid(I'm not talking about your height :P) at heart and helps hungry souls by providing all the eatables she stores in her room :D. Three years in Bits and we have quite a few memories worth recollecting. I really dont remember how I met this cute and small kid or how I started being opening to her. But I'm happy we are good friends today. I am really grateful to her when she allowed me to share her room during 2-1 compre, thanks to the "bed-bugs" incidents. She is very caring,innocent and rarely understands when people are being sarcastic. Hope you grow up to understand it one-day kid :D!  She is a hard-core non-veg lover and does anything to have chicken :D. The stupid arguments which we veggies(me and harry) v/s non-veggies(you and anu) are definitely not worth remembering :P :D. I love the way she studies. If she does not follow a concept, she drops it entirely rather than learning it blindly. She is hardly bothered about her score. At the end of the day, whatever she learns matters to her. She loves her subjects especially the ones related to EEE.She keeps experimenting with all the related softwares and tools.She has great knowledge about many mathematicians(hope you become one in the future :D) too.Her DC nick says it all! How can I forget? She even has a portrait of Dr. Ramanujam in her room :O _/\_ right from the first year. I hope I forget the stupid movie which she made me watch after 2-1 compre :P :D. I love teasing her and will continue to do so! Will definitely miss your laughter-like-talks. You have an amazing personality and carry yourself very well. Keep rocking and do stay in touch. P.S:I forgot to mention about "ISH" and "HISH" :D. Do make them proud ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>

<p>Ramyaa Teja!! From the time I & sonali used to wonder ,"whos our common neighbor ?"for half of the 1sts sem, Ramya is a totaally diffeerent person if you really know her.Initially I used to find her weird when she used to have dese pictures of mathematicians in her room.But now, I know shes is crazy about 'mathematics' and also fun and laughs at absolutely everything I say !  Thank God,I have you as ma neighbor  for every little thing I needed and you dint provide  but thought I was funny that I asked you . For also never giving me anything to eat cuz you had allready finished the Good day or Lays!! Ramya is very humble, helpful , bubbly gal who is also very hardworking (God knoes wen she studies wid her early bed  times!!)  and fun to be around with.And she sleeps early in weird positions which is someting to make fun of! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shahzarin">shahzarin</a></p>
