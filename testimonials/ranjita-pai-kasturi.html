<h1 class="page-title">Ranjita Pai Kasturi</h1><p>Yao ! First of all, Thank You ! For everything. I seriously do not know what I would done without you. You've been really helpful with notes, wake-up calls, doubts and what not. The best thing being you have never made me feel guilty for not attending lectures and mooching off your notes. Really helpful that was ! I have been in awe of your sheer grit and drive during exams. Never seem to get tired. Plus real smart. Awesome combo that is. Though few in number, Bogmalo trips  have been fun with you around. You owe me a pair of slippers btw :D .  Thanks for making Physics fun, hoping EEE will be better. Ciao.

<p>Ranjita...i have known her since my first year...we started out as studymates in 1-2 and moved on to become the best friends who would share anything and everything under the sun. She is really intelligent and aces all her compres. She makes such good notes, I wish u were doing cs cdcs with me ;) This Physics coordinator somehow manages to find time for everything – be it studies, basketball, sitar classes, Kala, outings and spending time with friends. She is my source for most of the college gossip. Sometimes I feel like she knows more than half of the campus :P. Thanks to her chirpy and talkative nature, she can befriend almost anybody. She is very creative and is always ready to experiment with new things. She can be naive at times but she has come a long way since she got here, thanks to arushi and kriti. 
She always has my back covered even if i am wrong. She always motivates me to do my best and is a constant source of inspiration. She pushes me out of my comfort zone, something which I really appreciate. I will always remember our trip to bogmalo in the middle of compre, our night-outs before every exam and my first vodka shot.
I know that I can always count on you. I am sure you will do great in future. Aim for the stars. I hope we stay friends forever and ever! xoxo :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-dhoot">Shruti Dhoot</a></p>
<p>Ranjita!! Its rather funny how we met each other in the library, when we were studying ES 1 together and somehow till date i managed to be friends with such a nerd like u! (Alright i m just kidding!) An extremely intelligent yet super dumb person ( i still haven't understood how she manages to be both at the same time), you can make her believe everything from the sun rises in the west to that man is actually a werewolf! She is truly a younger sister to me who i love advicing, studying, spending time and dressing up with(even though its usually me dressing her up, read younger sister!). She is amazingly helpful to even those who she meets the minute before, extremely caring and one of the most genuine people i have met. Always restless in a very cute kind of way, you will always find her worrying about the next assignment, the next class, the next test and practically everything to do with acads! She always knows how to get her work done and because she is so sweet, that people just do it for her happily.  Her laugh always cheers up my dull mood. Her whole demeanor will remind you of a 10 year old kid who will become happy on even a candy stick. The twinkle in her eyes is very contagious. Always remain the happy, cheerful kid that you are. Love you! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Omg... Ranjita..!! one nerdy girl who used to attend all classes, used to get up at 5 in the morning,  gained an all new avatar to this fancy chick who hardly did so.. :P Thank God for that ! :D No more annoying and totally carefree girl has an awesome sense of humour..!! And yeah how can I not mention the amazing time we had in palolem, and the super yummy ice cream at baskin robbins..!! I think there is an awesome quality in you to entertain people. Keep it up always..!! I wish you all the best for your future ! God Bless..!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>
<p>Ranjita!!..one of the few girls i kno in this campus. she is studious, hard working n fodu girl!! she does have photographic memory, never forgets even a single thing which she has read or heard of.. though she always says, "i m taking li8!".. but then dont fall for it.. its just that she will finish 2nd or max 3rd in the exam rather being 1st.. (never mind :P). Her notes are all colorful and simply Godlevel _/\_ (i cant even prepare such notes in dreams!! thnx for the stat-mech.. :P). Library is her "first" home in BITS, then comes her room.. :D. apart from studies.. she is really a humorous n cool person to hang out with. she loves dancing (as far as i kno... John's impression.. :P), and yes, she is a gud dancer (but not better than me.. :P). she readily mixes up with new people she comes across and knows how to get her work done!! :D. she never gets tired of chatting!! (most common point of all girls!! :D). but in this case, those chats are entertaining... ;). she is a gud friend and knows how to turn grudge to friendship.. :). i m sure of ur superb future, wishing you all the best for it, n remain the way you are!!, entertaining n techno-dumb (just kidding :P) :) 
PS: ur hindi is godlevel.. _/\_ :P :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nilesh-bhala">Nilesh Bhala</a></p>
<p>" Art " of living is what i can redefine when it comes to her; from decorating her own cute lil finger nail or a poster or making those color coded notes creativity comes to her naturally ! Every time she has something intricately crafted in her room which leaves you astounded. One of the most systematic and hardworking people on campus , acing acads is the way of life for her yet doing everything else she wants to do ! ( hopefully i will see you tipsy in the year to come :P ) Very focused at what she wants to do ; i am she will continue her run at nailing her goals and laughing in the most unique way i have ever seen so far :)  Good Luck !

<p>Grow up! (Please :P) You are really a very sweet girl and always bubbly and happy. We really have had lots of nice times together and i hope for more to come in the future. You have been too busy with your physics this sem :| hope you get a 10 for this effort NERD *cough* NERD! Even after the world ends i'm sure you will still go and eat in the mess 4 times a day :P From the mid exam bogmalo outing to you staying in my room to disturbing you in the library (i hope i succeeded some time atleast) it all has been really fun :D The best part of it all is just how entertaining it has always been to make up stories and prank you :D Kunal, Arushi, Sood (Srini too :P and so many others) and I really had a lot of fun and i'm sure we have been more creative than what we expected ourselves to be :P Always be  happy and i'm sure one day you'll get your PhD and be this hot shot scientist at some super duper lab! :D Defy the laws of physics Ranjita ;) This surely is not goodbye :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>
<p>Very talkative(actually its 'veryyyyyy') and easily mingles with every one. She is always happy regular to class(only till T2..:D) and helps everyone with a smile in her face. Its actually fun to spend time her.She is actually the personification of enthusiasm.  She had made physics courses easier for every1(except a few..:D who already finds it easy) with her awesome  notes. If you notice her in class you will see her writing with 3 or 4  pens of different colors. I don't know what i wud have done without her notes.I know("have heard ") that she is the physics Cordinator and did a wonderful job.She is a good basketball player also and how she manages time for all this is a mystery. I know this is not the end and we still have one more year to rock and hope that year is more fun and less hectic..(EEE...:P). No formalities like wishing for future and all..:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>I first heard Ranjita's name in some LT when she topped some course. At that time i thought she is so intelligent, so she must be one of those high flying types :P . But when i got to know her recently i realised how wrong i was. She is the sweetest, most humble, down to earth human being i have encountered in this campus. At first she was very soft spoken, then a bit louder and then finally now that she knows me well, she is just bombastic !!! once she starts talking there is no stopping her :D . In mess i avoid eye contact with her and concentrate on my food so that she stops talking :D (kiddin !!). But jokes apart, she is an extremely helpful, amazingly talented person. She tops most cdcs and all the faculty members know her !!! Her sense of fashion is better than many others :) . This deadly combo of beauty and brains has won her many secret admirers among seniors and juniors alike . Her colorful notes reflect her colorful attitude(or maybe that's just her nerdiness). I will cherish your gossipy tales and our bitching conversations \m/(Sunil Cooper :O) . Ranjita, keep smiling , stay cheerful and be sweet as ever :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-naik">Aditya Naik</a></p>
<p>Ranjita.. I really came to know her well in the end of 3-1, thanx 2 emt group study. She is one person whose company I enjoy. What I like about her is that she laughs at every silly little thing. She comes across as a fun person, always smiling and very talkative. She is a wonderful artist and has amazing creativity. She writes her notes with 4 different colored pens and makes tattoos on her hand in class when she gets bored. Her hands and nails are constantly adorned with her "art".. a proof of her creativity. Her room is decorated beautifully. She is one of the most focused and determined persons I have met. Thanx to our group studies that we actually knew each other better and spent more time together.. She is one person who made my physics year worth remembering. Her chattiness always lightens up my mood n den we can go on chatting n laughing 4 hours... Keep laughing and smiling.. wishing u the best 4 everything...  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nisheeta-desai">Nisheeta Desai</a></p>
<p>RANJITA PAI OHHOOO..!!  the day I attended  my 1st physics CDC lecture i knew it was going to be really tough but then at the same time ranjita pai – “the goddess of literature” entered into my life and saved me from the various ill’s of Msc physics. If today I am not in ACB it’s only because of you ranjita, no matter how bad you have written my testimonial I will still write good in yours, because that’s me :P. With your each effort to make me interested in physics you have earned my respect and i must say i have never seen a girl to do so well in studies and at the same time party like hell, you truly are a champ. This whole year with you was amazing I had a lot of fun, especially in our optics lab those 6 hrs a week were just amazing. Our diwali night out,bogmalo trips and physics discussions(hahah..!! megaLOL) wont be the same without you, whole this year your company is the most cherished one. And I have pity to all those EEE students who will face the goddess next sem, they are surely going to  lose their grade. Stay the the way you are, you are the best. Be in touch - AB<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorv-bhardwaj">Apoorv Bhardwaj</a></p>
<p>Ranjita!! Pure charisma!! Always fun to be around with. A brilliant mind & a care free girl (or may be even careless :p). I wonder how come you were nominated for the Nerd Queen, as in these guys must be really ignorant of your Bogmallo exploits. The time at Monji with you and Nisheeta and all those EMT 2 classes were real fun. I have rarely seen her upset about anything, always-in-a-fun mood type of person. And that is how one should be, right? And ofcourse calling her with names like ***jita, gossip girl etc. Mind you!! She is, even by the lofty standards of girls, a real-gossip-girl :p. And all the EEE pp.!! She makes just superb notes!! With some assorted hand picked colored pens and a complex algorithm on how to use the different colors, her notes are as good as the text book itself. She is indeed real good at acads, but the best part is that she is not one of those cry-baby types, doesn't matter to her whether she tops or flunks the course, doesn't matter who scored more/less and other such nonsense. Thats real +ve competition :). Be as you are. That eternal happyness state. Hope that our physics group remains in touch(and have more of those bogmallo outings). Keep on spreading smiles(that sounds kinda lame, but thats what i meant). Cheers!!(pun intentional ;).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>One of the most down-to-earth, hard-working people on campus. Not very easily scandalized, and surprisingly good propensity to do setting with profs. When Ranjita's at Bogmalo, everybody knows. So long, and thanks for all the notes.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Ranjita, a fun loving girl and always jumping with enthusiasm. She can make friends with everyone and just can't stop talking.  (We checked that right? :) ) Got to know her first during PS1. She managed to have fun even in a boring place like Pilani. All those photos of your epic trips will surely make CEERI the most sought after PS station this sem :P. Though we dont meet much now, her company in PS1 was sure fun.  It is very easy to take her case.   But she takes it very sportingly and knows how to laugh at herself. That is one quality in her which i admire. Wishing you best for your future and keep smiling as always... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/durgesh-rane">Durgesh Rane</a></p>
<p>One of the most intelligent girl on campus. I really admit that. I don't remember when I have first known you but we had the most awesome MT-II group of all. She just used to build circuits in a flash when we were trying to grab it on the manual. Electronics is her forte. She is just one girl who is capable of taking light. I have never seen any other girl on this campus doing that so easily. Thanks for participating with me in "go green". That was very helpful of you. For the fact of it, she is just one non-stop talkers. You just have to give her a topic and she just goes on. That's the best part somehow. She is one of the creators of awesome category notes which physics people thrive on with four colors of pen. I still don't know where that dedication comes from. Its just too good. Best of luck to all the EEE people in the next sem, because you are surely going to miss your grades. And as a reminder, you are going to help me with DECO. Don't forget. Be in contact. Wishing you a great luck ahead and I know you are going to make it big.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>Pilani trip planner.Full of enthusiasm hard working ,foccussed yet is extremely humble in nature.Talkative and fun loving,she kept PS-1 lively in a dry place like Pilani.She respects everyone a lot and is very frank about opinions.She likes to roam around places and enjoy life.Her hindi is a bit funny but she has innocence that of a little child.Few of the intelligent and actually interested in learning,kind of girl on campus.May God Bless You.Best Wishes.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shabbar-a--vejlani">Shabbar A  Vejlani</a></p>
<p>Thanks for being a pacifier during my fight with AVK ! Without you I surely would have been crushed under his mighty hands.According to me she completely energetic and possess amazing personality ! 
As a piece of advice don`t freak out ! Peace !
