<p>Rash Dash... amazing person... i have never seen a girl like her... totally frank and straight forward... speaks her mind out... at the same time very emotional... exhibits dual personality... And a very good boxer... lol... i can vouch fr that.. a loyal friend!! she can help you out in time of need... bt one frightening thing abt her is tht she is very short-tempered and very moody... one should prefer running away than facing her in this mood... bt at the same time shes also the best person to advice you whenever you are faced with a problem.. overall, a complete package...;) 
so rash, be the way you are...  u rock!! just plz dont go on punching me fr no reason!! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-baokar">Ishaan Baokar</a></p>

<p>Funny how I know this girl for more than 5 years now..but came to 'know' her in last one year!
Coolest M.E girl...tha's all I'll say...and I'm proud to have been ur classmate for 5 years! :P
She's funny, witty, facetious, down-to-earth,confident, aplomb and emotional (although i don't know this side of her quite well!). She's a total fun loving gal..all in all...a gr8 person to hang out with. I wish u a tremendous future ahead..be who u are..keep the appealingness alive..believe in urself, Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground and u'll go sky-high in ur life!
