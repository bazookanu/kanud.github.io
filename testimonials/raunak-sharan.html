<h1 class="page-title">RAUNAK SHARAN</h1><p>What can I say about this guy?! He is quirky and interesting in just the right amounts. We have common views on everything we hate, and hate even more ;) There have been countless instances when we just talked and talked and then suddenly realize a couple hours have gone by. A great friend, whose laptop I accidentally crashed once (sorry!) we would stand for hours on the balcony bashing everything BITSian. Here is to a great guy and a great friend. Have an awesome life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>I still remember, I first met him while he was looking for some notice on hostel notice board and from their on it was  good  knowing him for 3 great years. He's without any doubt a profound coder along with qualities of being a true friend. Sometimes off the road but overall down to earth with a lovely smile, which I think he should show more often. He has his own way of living life and making friends which is good and makes him different from others. To add he is hard-working, and passionate about everything he does. I wish him all the very best for a great healthy, wealthy future ahead :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
