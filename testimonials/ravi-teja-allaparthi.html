<p>ROD, as all friends call him, is a pro cricketer, volleyball player and gamer. He is very hardworking and dedicated person, studies very well. Can completely finish mugging up a whole textbook in a single day. He does anything for his friends and genuinely smiles with all his 32 shining teeth visible. Always takes time to help anyone just before exams as well. He is one of my best friends, always first one to help me in academics. All the best!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankeerth">Sankeerth</a></p>
<p>Allaparthi ravi teja or simply ROD :P as we all call him.. is one hell of a guy :P a very good friend to hang out with. And has a gifted photogenic memory... seriously if you bunk with him on his/your one night stand before exams you'll be like "how the fk did he manage to remember all that formulae / theory in one night  o.O" ( and i meant it :P ). A good gully cricketer and ex- college basketball player. A person you can rely upon for help at any time.
Will always remember his smile and the way he brushes his teeth :P XD . a perrrrooooo CS player (matka specialist as some ppl say :P). Will miss the times i crashed in your room during PS-1 @ ramagundam it was a memorable 2 months stay ( without you i seriously doubt how i would have survived 2 months of summer heat >.<). All the crazy chats, gully cricket we played in our hostel,small fights will dearly be missed :'( . wishing you all the very best for your future. Stay in touch :) will always be a ping away....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/k--sharath-chandra">K  Sharath Chandra</a></p>
<p>ROD aka matkist aka maggist. whatever name u call him he will simply smile with his 32 teeth visible..that's a mark of him..i can say they are his gifts..a pro cs and volleyball player..
also he is at all the games he played ..he will give his 150% to those things he like
(that 50% is from his matka )..normally he will in half naked in hostel with his tiny blue colour short because of heat coming from his matkas...all those moments he will shout about some things in our corridor are just irritating...but i love them because this is time i can argue with him with my guts..he wont listen to anybody when he is angry(normally during cs playing) he will just keep on shouting..
kk that's one side..
in another side he is a best friend of mine ..a very helpful person..best for his thoughts about everything...helpful in acads also with his memory (really _/\_ )...his interest in sports is awesome..and his commitment also..a good gully cricket player with his dravid innings...
altogether he is just awesome in whatever he will do..
all the very best for your future..will miss you..
