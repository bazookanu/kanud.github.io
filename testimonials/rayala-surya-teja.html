<h1 class="page-title">Rayala Surya Teja</h1><p>Suri baby,as i call him is funny,lovable,very interesting.Our one more KKR stud who is the epitome of the imbaness in studies as such he is a fucking 8p.He is not a nerd coz he usually hangout with us,all the time plays CS,i love his magging,but still manages studies,goes to every class.All the night we play CS and we sleep in the morning,this guy dont know how god created him,goes to classes.And very helpful guy without whom our cg (our refers to me,venky especially) would have been ultimate gg.We bug him all the nite before exams and fuck hats off to his patience,as patient as an austere.We always talk about girls,making fun of his crushes on campus  and blah blah....And kindly note you ppl who jus know him,he is not a innocent as you think he is!!!! We know it all about him.thankful to god for giving me the wonderful times with these bloody frnds.We are never apart baby!! :) <3.                        -----------------------Andy<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anudeep-bodireddy">Anudeep Bodireddy</a></p>
<p>The most funniest, lovely and coolest person. Can attract anyone with his awesome actions. You are the one I like to disturb when ever I am bored. You know what to do and when to do things and this is sufficient for you to become successful in life. You are the best in all the things you do and this attracts the people towards you. I will miss you and I would never forget you. :D

<p>Surya Teja aka batta aka brahmi... i am loving this(writing a testimonial to this batta) bcoz... i could just remind of all those activities he usually do... the most funniest guy((or i must be using the word GAY :P))... a PRO :P cs player... his memory power is just :O... a fucking 8p... excellent manager of time.. perfectly balanced both acads and fun.. an ideal bitsian... and above all a best and admirable friend of mine.. :-* i admire him not becoz he is an 8p or something... but he has seriously got a hell of patience... he never gets pissed off... no matter how much u irritate him... GOD LIKE PATIENCE _/\_... and he does all the things by himself... never asks for a hand to help... at ne position of life... he is the most fun to be kind of a guy in the campus... he always gets weird doubts about girls.. :P he is so shy to open up in public... he is a calm going guy... but once u get close to him... he shows all his talent :D.. if there is a guy whom i never hated in all these 3 years at ne point of time, he is batta :D.. in the first sem.. we have all our classes common except chemistry... dats how we actually got close to each other... i can never forget those combined studies and FILTHY discussions we had :D :P... the way u used to irritate me(scratching >.<)... will be remembered forever... :D you are part of most of my memories in BITS... apart from all these i share everything with him... and batta dont worry abt ur batta... becoz i will sponsor ur hair transplantation once i achieve what i want in life :D wish me all the best :P... and it is really very hard to accept that u wont be roaming around me and irritate me as ur leaving to your PS-2 in sem 1... :( but still we shall rock in khammam... \\m// bybye batta... last 20 days for us as a group in bits... will have dat void in life missing a funny and a god like person like you... wishing u all the best in your future... urs rakesh :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dammalapati-rakesh">Dammalapati Rakesh</a></p>

<p>hey surya...although nobody calls him with this name ..just for this testimonial...he is  funniest guys i met in this campus..all those crazy things he did ..they are all jus awesome rey..cant stop to laugh at those..if you are in stress  he is right person to meet..his acts are similar to brahmi (its another nick of him).. as we are in same branch also i can say he is a bit lucky some times but normally hardworking..all those night outs and before exam hangouts..god knows how he manages all these things with his skills as a  cs player and true KKK fan ..god like time management & be cool at all times.: and so on....he is the best guy to hangout at all times..
he attended all classes and he is an 8p...

<p>surya aka suri is one of the good friends of mine.He is the stud of EEE.He calls himself PRO CS player but you can hardly find him playing CS.U can find him either studying or watching shitty Nicholas cage movies all the time.He is short and funny who takes good care of his hair.He even uses hair conditioner after head bath :P.He hits the ball harder in gully cricket than in normal cricket ;).He won't sleep during exams and won't come out of his room if he fails to do well in the exam..Will miss u suri :( Do stay in touch.with best wishes-urs harsha :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nadella-sriharsha">Nadella SriHarsha</a></p>
