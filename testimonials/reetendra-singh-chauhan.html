<p>Reetendra aka chauhan aka cobra aka ch**a aka reetu, has been given endless names in the recent years .. He is my most notorious friend and my personal favourite target. :) ..This dada of the group has been registered to be involved in the most number of fights.. both verbal and physical..:P Reetendra is blessed with awesome qualities like patience, self-belief, an extraordinarily clever mind, whatever trouble we might fall into , Reetu has the most clever(or probably the most dishonest ) solution to it.. no matter how bitter the circumstances are, he never loses his calm, he acts on it with full devotion and produces astonishing results.. we both have played so many pranks together, mostly on our fixed target sandy, on obvious topics , that some of them are making me smile while writing this testimonial, I dont know what is it about him, his awesm personality and physique,or his excellent money saving skills, or his typical way of giving sarcastic remarks on situations , or his sense of humour , that he is the favourite for all of us.. Apart from being notorious and academically sound, reetendra also has an emotional side to him, which he has,i dont know how,but  managed to hide from everyone here... he is ofcourse a caring friend, a man of words( a man of ego too :P).. No matter how much ill,i speak of you, or play stupid fb pranks with you, one thing i really wanna confess.. you are one of my most special friends in this campus.. I really admire you for the man you are.. and thank you for adding a tint of tadkaa in my college life, which otherwise would have been so boring.. may you achieve what you aim for, get phodu placement in amazon or some biggie!! god bless..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>
