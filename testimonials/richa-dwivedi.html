<p>Richa!!!
u are probably THE most interesting person i have et, not only on campus, but everywhere :P
A few things i love about you are your willingness to try something new and your constant interest to learn. you love to experiment and that is great, because u dont get discouraged if u cant do something new, but you keep trying to be better :). Apart from all that, you are really fun to be around. when i look back n remember you i will always remember times when we would all take your case n joke around n i love the way you responded! But everything was always in good spirit n you were always the life of the conversation. you can make us all laugh and that is a great virtue. I have always enjoyed going for meals together and going for walks, meeting up late night in each other's rooms just to talk totally nonsensical silly stuff and all those things are very special to me. Life in BITS as i know it would be incomplete without you. Thanks for being such a great person! N do keep in touch, we will make sure we meet in the future somehow!

P.S. dont worry, you are NOT fat at all..ur damn damn DAMN thin..stay like this only ;) :P (i just had to mention that :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tara-ramanan">Tara Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Richa Dwivedi= Guaranteed fun. She's just absolutely amazing. Be it her punjaban daring attitude to the unknowingly cute and cutely stupid things she does sometimes, she has this charm around her that you just have to like her. This girl knows how to have fun. She is smart and cute and one of the most fun company to have. Just be richa and all of us around you are going to have a lot of fun great time.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Richa you are so cute! That's the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of you. Always willing to try new things, fun loving, always worried about something or the other, a very passionate dancer and an extremely thin girl! (yes its true, hope that makes you happy :D) And Richa, I seriously respect you for your guts, never afraid of anything different, always adapting to changes, and the best thing about you is that you live for yourself, not for others, doing everything you like to do without worrying about the world. I've had a great time with you, will miss you a lot. Wishing you lots of luck! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>Richa!! My first memory of you is in our first year, when you told me "i might go to Mesra please don't tell anyone". After that, here and there we would acknowledge each other but i truly got to know you only in our maths year when i saw what a chilled out yet super tensed person you are. Awesome fun to talk to, its always really helpful to come and talk to you after an extremely screwed up exam and listen to your cool words of advice, at the same time calm you down about your exam as well. I will definitely miss the sessions that we had where we cursed our hearts out about engineering and why we took it! Maths year wouldn't have been as much fun without you. All the best for future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Richa, i remember knowing you and talking to you since 1-1. We talked about the tutions you had in Chandigarh and about the people there. We talked about random shit and your love for Pallak/ Palak! :P. Since this last year thanks to MSc maths I have come to know you better. You have truly grown as a person. Your never ending zeal to become better and your curiosity to know everything set you apart. You are one of the strongest persons I know who carry themselves with all the self-respect. You are always helpful, clearing all my doubts during exams and then of course we start discussing how boring all that shit is. :)
Thanks for all your help and hoping that you never change. Keep that smile on always! All the best for your future :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-syal">Priyanka Syal</a></p>

<p>I met Richa in my 2-2 when we had taken phonetics together. Since then, we have spent quality time together. She's this sweet, funny, weird girl who can always make you laugh by her amusing reactions to almost everything! She is a great dancer, a big foodie like me, and loves to dress up!! She is hardworking and sincere, and definitely knows how to have fun!! And the thing that I admire the most about her is her guts. Stay the same!!
N yeah Richa, I will definitely paint your portrait some day!! :D
Love you loads!!
