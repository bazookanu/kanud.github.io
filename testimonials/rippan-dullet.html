<h1 class="page-title">Rippan Dullet</h1><p>She is one of my best friends on campus and belongs to my department. We first got introduced in class when she asked for my Maths1 notes and finally I ended up teaching her a sure shot question in the paper. We have been good lab partners and it used to be really interesting to listen to her stories in lab. During the course of our CDC year, our friendship became stronger and through the interactions that I have had with her, I came to know about her really good nature which most people may fail to realize. Her attitude towards life and her rational thinking puts her equal to all those people whom I consider worth learning from. Her motivation to study boring subjects and in a crisis will be things that I would miss. She always remains calm and tries not to over react even in difficult situations. Hope to carry on with this friendship for many more years to come. You will always remain special to me.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-viswanathan">VINAYAK VISWANATHAN</a></p>
<p>I remember the first few days of college when i saw her for the first time and thought she looks like such a cute kid! We became friends in the first month and had some awesome times! All the bogmalo trips, the late nights chats, the classes we bunked and the pranks we played. We brought out the crazy side in each other! People may say a lot but she's one of the sweetest, most simple and down to earth people. We've had our ups and downs but i'm really glad we became friends. Keep in touch, I'll miss you. Cheers to all the crazy memories :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
