<h1 class="page-title">Rishabh Goel</h1><p>Rishabh Goel is great person and a very practical man. His knowledge of economics and his interest in economics is worth mentioning. He is the person who tries to makes a system efficient and no doubt he is perhaps the best mess convener I have seen in 3 years. He is the kind of guy whom you can trust without any doubt. He is always ready at your service, whatever be the conditions and whatever be the time, like a real friend. I would like to thank him specially for his support as I prepared for CIMA GBC. While others find fault in a system, this person not only finds faults but also strives to correct the fault in the system. He is a good person at heart and that is what matters the most to me. I wish him a great and successful future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>A very genuine person. He might appear to you a bit blunt at first but once you come to know him he is the nicest guy. A very good friend, he always means the best for you. i will always cherish the long talks that I have had with him( of ten on random useless topics). He is a voracious reader( respect ). One of the very few people in the campus who actually has interest in his\her branch. His understanding about economics is great and i am sure that will take him to achieve great heights in life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>If BITS was a kindergarten Rishabh Goel would be that chubby kid standing outside the class shouting "I hate you all but I love myself & my LedZep tee :P". He and I have had our select few first class moments which I'm pretty sure I'll never forget even if I want to. His immense knowledge about his subjects is pretty intimidating at times but mostly flattering. He will always stand out of the crowd not just because he looks different but because he is a unique person all in all. He and I share a common sense of art in movies, tv and few other things.May you fly high legally :P wherever you go and reach greater heights, 'cause that's where you are meant to be.Enjoy :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Rishabh is a man of knowledge! As is the quality of intellectuals, his laziness is the only thing that stops him from doing things. I've enjoyed late night discussions with him on all kinds of interesting topics ranging from economics to black swans to politics to philosophy, nature of mind and spirituality and the list just goes on.....
He is Mr.Plain Hearted and he sometimes does have trouble putting up with the ways of the world! He's a good person at heart and all his true friends respect him for this quality! I haven't seen one other person who looks at the world so impartially!
Way to go Rishabh! You'll earn lot of respect wherever you go! All the best! :)   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Noijja....my neighbour, my dear friend, this page is too short to describe the bond we share with each other. I still remember when I first met you, I was just about to open my door, when I heard a voice saying "hey i am rishabh, what's your name?" in your unique tone. I would be frank to say that I just couldn't figure out your name the first time. But since then the guy whom I thought to be a wierd person turned out to be one of my best friends on campus. You are a guy who does only what he wants to do and no one can stop you from doing it. Your understanding of economics is mind-boggling. You always help me whenever the need arises and the talks I have with you always help me learn something new and interesting. The only thing I perhaps hate about you is your kind of music (especially when you put it on loop), and you know that :P. I would just like to say (even though we are here for one more year & yeah, you better choose a room next to me in CH1) that you are a unique person and come what may, just be yourself and do not change for anyone. Hope you have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Fellow book and music lover. Has read an insane number of books and has a great collection too. Noijja has very strong opinions on subjects be it Music, Books (LoTR :D ) or Economics. Really passionate about the subject. One of the few guys I know who doesn't study for the marks. He is an awesome guy to argue with. Made my stay in Chennai memorable with the binges we had at his place. Really has some clout in the mess and I must say you've done your job well Noida. Cheers and best of luck for LSE !

<p>Rishabh Goel .. heard alot about him during 2nd year ... from Economics people. That gives an expression of nosy 9p . Actually got to know him in 3rd year as a mess rep. He is a person who really is dedicated for the work he is passionate about. He loves Food , LOTR , Anime and is really passionate about economics. A fun person to hangout with .  As I see anime has contributed for his av minuses ;) he will go places for he has a vision to make things better. So far our entire messreps team has been the best and most active team in CSA and you have played your role very well Rishabh :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Goelji..! (Hahahaha! SO cool :D)
I became friends with this jolly fellow in 2-1 when without a POE text book he was the MidSem topper. He just happened to know everything that was to know in Economics. He has a flair for that subject and loves every part of it. He can put his body, mind and soul into  studying that subject when he wants to.
Rishabh is  a great guy to hang out with. I've shared some epic moments with him, formulated some amazing B-plans ( or so we believe :P ), debated with him on the most silliest topics for minutes on end and always ended up having a blast every time! :)
He has constantly been pestering me to read LoTR  and I solemnly swear that inspite of my multiple attempts I shall do so someday :)
I have had great fun battling it out on the Mumbai vs Delhi and (Doha!!) topics and the Nadal-for-king talks :D
I kno whe shall do great eco stuff in live and it was a great pleasure to know him now and for all the times to come!
I wish him all the very best and hope you take the messes of BITS Pilani, Goa Campus to all new heights!
Cheers, =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/namrata-nadkarni">Namrata Nadkarni</a></p>
<p>I have known him since the first sem but got to know him better from 2-1 onwards when our Eco courses started. His knowledge on Economics is pretty amazing and he is a natural at it. He is a biggg fan of LOTR(^_^) and after me and my brother parted for our respective institutes, I finally found someone with whom I could talk about books and LOTR as easily as i could talk with my brother. The discussions have been nothing short of epic. Being a sports lover too, our interests match a lot which always gives us plenty to talk about. Will miss having him alongside me in EEE. I wish u all the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>This kind of look alike of mine and me became friends since I dont remember when. He was the one who emerged victorious out of 17 candidates for Mess Rep of our Hostel (AH4 \m/) in the first year. He has immense love for whatever he does be it watch sports in common room, read books (not just LOTR :P) listen to music etc... As the A mess convener in his 3rd year he has worked his ass off coming with something new every time. He is best remembered in the hostel for a certain incident of him attending Jessica Mam's 'tut'. Rishabh - best wishes for your future and may you excel in all the avenues of life!! Cheers!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>Rishabh is one of the most memorable people that I have come across at BITS. I have known him since the 1st semester and he has always been a very simple, straightforward guy. He's also very helpful and trustworthy. Working with him for Master the Market (Quark 2010) probably brought out the best in me. He never takes things for granted and always looks for concrete reasoning. He's very knowledgeable, has admirable taste in music and his interest spans a variety of subjects. He has a natural flair for economics and I expect him to do very well in the future. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>"The world is changed.I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air...Much that once was is lost. But our friendship lasted."
He is a LOTR reference book for me. I keep on asking him doubts about the LOTR world. He knows so much about it that sometimes I feel that he owns a small house in the Shire where he enjoys the life on Middle Earth.
I enjoy playing badminton with him especially because of his reactions when he misses a shot( can't describe them... :P). But a good player. As a mess convener, he keeps pressure on mess managers to maintain the good quality of food as well as the cleanliness in the mess. He is very particular about that.
I am sure he will become a cool manager or some Eco. professional.

<p>the reason why AH4 now knows Doha is in which country....is this guy. "Noijja" as he is well known, is one of the ppl i'm gonna remember after leaving the campus. he is well known for his LedZapp T-shirt (equally common is the chelsea jersey) and ever increasing LOTR love,(so much that even his fb timeline(and at times, even comments) are full of lotr). A very good badminton player as he is, he is also a very good and entertaining companion if you'd ever like to go out shopping. Propagating eco knowledgealong with publicity of BITS (with some more bakwaas) in his own unique voice (wish i could mimic that) through the shops of panaji, followed by pani-puri was awesome fun with him. Seriously man, I am gonna cherish those farewell shopping moments that i've had wid u. A very keen reader and an fan of high volume music ( :P ), rishabh also has a very profound knowledge of economics. A pro Dota player and a pappu fan, can be quite funny when he misses any shot in badminton.  missing any shot in badminton  for him would be as if frodo dying in lotr without destroying the ring.  this mess rep (now the convener) is simply unik in whatever he's done. 

Wishing u best of luck for ur future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>
<p>Risabh- He is insane and thats the best part about him.He loves everything he does,doesnt give a damn about what others think of him.Never have seen any1 live life to the fullest. Staunch believer in his  whether LOTR,Nadal,Chelsea,DD, he just follows his heart.At economics and finance,very few people come any close to him when its about knowing the basics.My friendship with him-awesome ; we fight over trivial issues, we have the fun of playing for the same gully cricket team ;occasionally ending up on the same side of sports; participating and organizing  events as a team.Loved every bit of it, dont ever change yourself for the foolish outside world.Best of luck ! cheers to a happy life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>

<p>Hello, I am Rishabh Goel from Noidja. Thats how it all started! One of the most popular guys in our hostel, and a very dear friend of mine.Very different from others, definitely not just another brick in the wall. A huge Led-Zep fan (that caricature of yours that Sharang drew on our hostel banner!).And an even bigger LoTR fan, perhaps the biggest I've ever seen.Has a really good taste in music (has shared some of the best music on DC).A voracious reader and can comment on a wide variety of topics.Very difficult to beat in an argument. Faadu economist. Was a good TT player (but left playing for some reason after first year :( ). Good at Badminton and kinda okay in Cricket :P. An ardent Chelsea and Real fan( occupies too much space in the Common Room though :P). Chaud!( mostly unnecessary), but suits you! We've had some really memorable memories together (the four seater ride in Noida and that awesome lunch we had at your place) and am sure there are many more to come.Its been great knowing you Rishabh and a great future awaits you :)
Be as you are and DO stay in touch.
Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>
<p>It is because of him nojja and LoTR have gained the popularity that they have :P And of course, his weird pronunciation makes him all the more popular and funny :)
He was the first person I went on a outing after coming to Goa( remember that majorda trip?) and had an awesome time. And the recent panjim trip, especially that arrow bargaining was just something which you should keep on doing :D
Typically appearing in 3/4ths and a LedZep tee, a very genuine, plain hearted, funny and very friendly guy(even though puts a lot of statuses about hatred to people). Music lover and a voracious reader of books. Though has of messiest room in the hostel, is also very knowledgable about his economics. A nice person to talk to and discuss things, he will listen you out and make you feel warm.
 And it's sad we took the participation lite. Koi nahi, There will be a next time.
Anyways, I hope you so what you want to do and have an amazing life :) All the Best.
PS. We still have a year left, we'll plan a trip next sem :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>Rishabh "noigga joel" Goel is one of my best friends in BITS Goa. He is undoubtedly THE most helpful person I have ever met. His passion for economics amazes me. A complete LOTR fanatic, he will floor you down into submission if you dare say anything against the lotr franchise. Having been the mess rep for ah4 he brought about many changes in the old system. Noijja has a very down to earth attitude. He always offers me chocolates which are kept in his room, but ends up eating the ones in my room :P . He does not trust people easily and calls their parents to verify facts :D . A fan of Led Zeppelin and also a jazz enthusiast, he always suggests some of the most amazing songs . A former vegetarian, he now has transformed into a vicious flesh eating monster(reason for his current size). A true engineer, he always analyses and calculates the outcome of any situation accurately and ends up successful . He is a very famous person and knows almost all people of 2009 batch(and all know him). He rarely wears full pants and prefers half pants, because he believes in comfort more than fashion(or maybe they don't make pants of his size). During college festivals he actively participates in various competitions and wins most of them. He is a very emotional badminton player and grunts like a pig when he loses a point. A true sportsman , he accepts defeat more gracefully than anyone else XD. I have had some of the most useless and mindrottening conversations with him. He is one of the first guy in the campus who understood my jokes and sense of humor. He watches TV serials with the enthusiasm of an Indian bahu .Very few people know that noijjesh kumar is a trained piano player and is a decent guitar player. I am saddened by the fact that we have only one more year together(lets try for a year back :D) . But i assure you that its gonna be epic \m/ . Keep following your heart and continue to work hard. Although i wanted to write a more comic testimonial, i am filled with emotions :') . I wish u all the best for your future. Keep laughing and gaining weight.

<p>Noija from Joha, well known for his versatility, and mischief in the common room especially during football matches when you are a supporter of a club he doesnt support :P We have been great friends since 3 years and right from day 1, he has been straight-forward with everyone. An avid lover of economics, DOTA, and food, this guy is perhaps most obsessed with the LOTR trilogy. He once did an assignment for me and I am deeply indebted to you for that :) A die-hard Kubendran-fan, his antics and helpful nature will never be forgotten.   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
<p>Risabh (or as people call him noijja) a fellow madridista and a fellow blues supporter. He is always active in the common room and never misses a single chelsea match. He is passionate about jazz music, led zepplin and economics. He has a weird sleeping schedule which is mostly because of DOTA. He has a funny accent and is a cool guy to hang around with. Don't ever get into an argument with him coz he will start a mini lecture series until you accept that he is right and you are wrong. He also has a funny way swearing people and almost everyone in AH 4 knows it. He is a good leader and a dedicated fella. I hope you have a great life ahead of you man and I hope to see a match with you at the Bernabeu or Samford bridge if possible. Keep in touch. Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>Rishabh is the first guy I met on campus. I have very faint memories of back then and of our first two years on campus with him but we have really come close in the last two semesters. He is a very unique guy, going about things his own way and not caring about what others think of him. Despised by a lot of eco people( labelled as a show-off by them) :P, this guy has immense knowledge about everything. Beginning from Economics to Human Evolution to Politics. The list is endless and so is hunger for knowledge. Our post mid-night hangout sessions have become customary lately and it is always fun having all those pseudo-intellectual conversations with him. and Ali. He is also a very voracious reader, a connoisseur of music an avid quizzer and a fellow foodie. Doesn't like to share his food at all :P. I know he'll make it really big in the future provided he does away with his lazy-ass habits. All the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>I forgot to mention the amount of dedication and hardwork he puts is an as mess convenor and the amount of authority he commands there.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Noijaa...... What can I say about this guy....  The sheikh from Doha..Kabeez ka Bacchi..  has become a very good friend. A big chelsea supporter that he is,  irritates almost all of the common roomners by his antics. He always fights for Delhi with me and Hegde and tho Delhi is going strong till now,Noijaa hum seedha final mein dekhenge jahan hoga dhoot ka dhoot aaur paani ka paani.. He is a big fan of Led Zeplin and that made him find his way on to AH4 Zephyr 2010 poster and trust me it was hilarious :P ..  Food lover that he is , he has gatecrashed MM dinner and probably the best uptil now.  I m gonna make him repay for this someday :P :P..  Noija , its been great knowing you especiallly you way of talking which makes u unique and likeable <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
<p>Noijaaa!!! I am amazed by the amount of literature you read!!! From Upanishads and Ayn Rand to Lord of the Rings to what not!! Has a really intelligible understanding of the stuff he reads, thats what i can say for sure after those AH4-AH5 pathway discussions ;). I have always believed that had you been in a much more sophisticated packing i.e. remove that +20 KG of fat + those ridiculous specs which you and pappu got (from zari??) + that childlike way of talking, then it would have been a general opinion that you are / \ guy who has an incredible knowledge and understanding of what he reads and what he does. And that is actually true, you do think clearly. A quality that is rare. But you know, those 20+ kg of fat and childlike innocence is what is Rishabh Goel. So just f**k 'em.. Never let them change you.. Keep in touch mate.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Goel is one of those persons in our corridor, with whom I like to have a conversation. He has immense knowledge about much stuff, so conversations with him can sometimes be never ending. One pro person in Eco…I still remember u teaching me POE…thanks a lot for tat!!!
Noijja would be the 1st person I would ask for a suggestion on music or novels or tv series. Goel, I will surely start watching “one piece” sometym :D. One can never see a person who loves Lord of the rings more than him. Just check it by posting some crap about lord of the rings, on FB!!! He’s a really funny guy, the way he cracks jokes is amazing sometimes and the way he speaks (like a kid) is fun to listen :D. He was mess rep for our hostel in the 1st year and then convener in 3rd year._/\__/\_ there couldn’t have been a better person. The most noticeable thing about him, atleast for his neighbours, is his MUSIC!!!He has a play list for every hour I guess!! It was in 3-1 when he first heard the song “ennamo edo”..aaarrgghh…he was playing the same song continuously for 24*5 days!!! Many a times he also has given me some really nice suggestions on music based on the genre. Anyways, have a bright future ahead!!And do stay in touch :)
