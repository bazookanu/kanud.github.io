<h1 class="page-title">Ritesh Ranjan</h1><p>One of the very few people who is passionate about everything he does ..Be it watching and playing cricket endlessly, devoting night after night to those circuits and codes or those marathon sessions of  completing TV series (or movies) at one go.If he is not doing any of the above activities then he can be found bragging  in somebody's room about his knowledge in these ( :D) . Always full of life and energy and an infectious smile . A child at heart and an Einstein at brain. Proud to be your friend and will always cherish our beautiful memories.

<p>Well...there is a saying "a creative adult is the child who has survived" and this fits perfectly for Ritesh Ranjan aka ritsz...the mind of a genius and the heart of a child makes this CREATURE a colourful personality...not at all an ideal student by definition :P but a never ending curiosity and a desire to learn has made him much more capable than most of us here...working on projects with him where we started from ground zero and ending up with something that we considered cool (though it was not always..) is one of the things that i am gonna remember for life..the ability of laughing at life regardless of anything (most of the times :P ) makes him a cool guy to be around....all in all a great friend and one of the few people i am glad i met...i am sure that life is gonna be great for you ahead no matter what...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-deshpande">Aditya Deshpande</a></p>
<p>An inspiring figure at times and a serious and seemingly introvert at some other times. Mr. Ritesh Ranjan is a very colorful guy indeed. A pure genius and a hard task master. Talented and passionate about whatever he does, be it acads or be it sports. One of those guys, teachers would be proud to have taught. Not really the teachers pet but someone that even they will respect for his knowledge and his desire to know more. You are one of those that i really think would chose knowledge and a research career over a comfortable corporate job. All the best for your future mate. Just keep rocking ritsz :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

Revolves around simplicity and passion and will also stand by you with these qualities when you need it . Show no nonsense and Take no nonsense is what evey1 should learn from him .

<p>Met him during the freshers party and the first thing i saw him do was dance off to a "Washing Powder Nirma" song.A guy passionate about whatever he does..For the first 1 nd a half years i always thought of him to be this calm,funny,always taking lite kinda guy.. but that was before i saw him in the lib with an "Artificial Intelligence" Book.The guy is a genius and no matter what one could always spot him in the common room during every cricket match . I am glad to have met u n best of luck with your future endeavors. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sriram-iyer">Sriram Iyer</a></p>

<p>Ritzy .  A tall lanky unassuming creature that one wouldn't notice. Well to those of you who didn't, I am sorry to break it to you but boss you've f**ked up bigtime. Fortunately for me i sort of ran into him , quite literally ,on the basketball court.  This is one the few people in our batch of ENI who knows what he is doing and heck he's good, real good. Imagine working on some insane botnets in a defence research lab , sounds like a nerdgasm to you future weapons fans and wannabe Sheldon Coopers.Hell yeah he's doing exactly that and he ain't even out of college yet. Tomorrow when i want to borrow some crazy tech to make some new mass botnet for world domination you know who's your man. (I have been knocking at his door quite a few times, to play out domination and counterdomination from the subjects and labs in my retarded head.  ) Fortunately (not too fortunate for him i'm guessing) for me he was my lab partner , so all I did was "vellpanti" trying to lighten the mood , while he fielded for the extra man, I  owe this to you man. As a friend great fun to talk to , unassuming, down to earth. He has a knack for slightly offbeat humour that take time to comprehend and at the same time a connoisseur of "Sastas", be rest assured you will never get bored when our man is in the room. I hope I am opportune enough so our paths meet one day. till then good luck and take care. Please do , no wait,  You Better stay in touch.

<p>The silent horse of AH5... works more talks less. He would often be seen discussing electronics with like minded people. He doesn't work for grades but interest drives him which got him a thesis opportunity in artificial intelligence. He would be roaming around in his vest in the hostel and playing under arm cricket inside the hostel. A die hard fan of Chelsea. Always gives a sarcastic smile at me when I pass him, till date I don't know why... sometimes cracks "sasta" jokes. I am lucky enough to get you as my neighbour. All the best and keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>

<p>Ritesh a.k.a ritzy is an electronic whiz-kid. He bleeds current. He does not have a spinal cord but an IC and a chip instead of brain tissues. This guy has a huge potential with little resistance, high capacitance, a short fuse, and great current. In other words he is extremely talented, can be a workaholic, is slightly short tempered, and has great enthusiasm. His dedication towards anything, be it his CDCs, image processing, tinkering with arduino, playing HAWX, or finishing that new tv series in a day, is commendable. He is one of the few people who actually know stuff related to their stream and apply it in practical usage. He is a genius with occasional wild mood swings but this guy is one hell of a colourful character to hang around with :D. He's a huge cricket enthusiast, good basketball player, sasta chelsea fan, and a devotee of the DADA. With an internship at DRDO already under his belt, he is sure to make it large in life.

Here's a toast to the movies at bellu's room, the discussions on tv shows/9gag, the chennai Ps, the underarm cricket and to the hilarious moments shared over our stay in BPGC. Best wishes, stay in touch :).
