Probably the laziest guy i have ever seen.......   His room is epic :D  the only reason y im not in lime light for my room maintainance is this guy who maintains his room even better than me :D ....... Never saw anyone who is addicted to coke even more than this guy :P  ...what not this goes on ... omg forgot he was part of   my happiest batch in 1st year :P   ......A complete family guy :D  ......  thanks for evrything rithin for being with me both ahppy n sad  moments ........  definitely will miss u but we have another sem together to rock and a life more to njoy :-)  keep smiling :-)  ur srik with love<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-yeleswarapu">srikanth yeleswarapu</a></p>
<p>yo jampi!! the laziest ass i have seen!!VERY HARD CORE Liverpool fan,sees almost every thing that comes on dc regarding football world.i think he knows more about football teams/clubs than the game :P... he can say you about a football player whose story is not even known by FIFA..such a knowledge he has :D...never ever misunderstand this ability of his that he uses it for acads also :P...he doesn't care whatever happens until it becomes GG :D...he has a typical type of mind which learns anything fast but cant simply  store somethings in it :P!!the place his room is situated(beside toilets :D),i think its the main reason for him to keep his room in a state which u cant think of..he is GOD that he lives in it..really _/\_ :D... similar to srikanth, he is also good at maintaining relationships..but he doesn't expose them to us...sort of introvert...
i think its through CS that i came to know him(or is it before itself?? i don't remember exactly)..sometimes,his accuracy in shooting goes beyond limits(still better than me though :P)..he never comes beyond tower until he gets level 6(if u know DOTA) :D..its fun to remind the way he screwed up his lap with every game that is existing on dc and the days when he was LAP-LESS,we both established Lap Less Club(LLC) :D.all these 3 years,those were the days-some of the best days-it was fun in having a friend like you...these are our last 30 days together :(.. hope we will meet in future :P.,.as of now, i wish you all d best for ur future and success in ur career(if u choose one :P).. :D    with best wishes,
urs

<p>Jampla is proest of the pro's in every aspect.coz he always starts off early than others do!! :P.Was a Pro CS player lately a noob.Was a pro dota player but yet again he is still a DOTA PRo as we know nothing abot DOTA.He doesnt have a word MESS in his Vocab.He is 12 hr forward bot.Does chudaap till morning and then sleep all the morning says fuck off bitch to the sun and wakes at 6 evening.Early evening break fast from SC,lunch at 12Am in NC.But we share almost everything.And forgot yet again a kkr stud.And more important is rithin and me does the weirdest and whackiest things which are many in fact!! We started drinking together,and blah blah.we share many a things.He actually is the kind of guy whom one wants to be when someoen is emotional.He is the one who gets it before you say a word and yeah i mean it.So many memories with you,this'd be the last sem we'd be together and we know that we are always together.Ob we will rock. Keep smiling baby!! :)...........Andy<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anudeep-bodireddy">Anudeep Bodireddy</a></p>

<p>wass up rithin.....i had a great time with u... a pro gamer... a great football fan...more than games and football he is addicted to coke :P.. pro player of my SS clan (Sattigadi santa) :P
"wen he is loosing a game, wen team need him, he finishes the game in style" this is the phrase i would say wen he plays cs.but in dota we cant expect anything like that, n that is why he is in my clan :P.. we together had an awesome fun in these 3 years, i am glad that i found a friend like you who is like me in most of the aspects...i wish you success in our career and all the best buddy..... keep smiling :) urs- satti<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/s-v-sateesh">S V Sateesh</a></p>
