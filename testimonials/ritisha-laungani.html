<h1 class="page-title">Ritisha Laungani</h1><p>Ritisha laungani..one of the biggest names in campus (in length - L.R.P.B. :P)!!... The first time we talked was in 2nd sem in workshop. A friendly person, and a great supporter of women's equality, I admired her straight-forwardness and ambition (which i still do). Don't even think of trying to belittle women in front of her or she WILL kill you, which in fact is a great thing about her! She loves kids, is a hard-working person, good at acads, and a good dancer. All in all, a girl of many talents and good nature. May you have a wonderful and successful life ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sandeep-sharma">Sandeep Sharma</a></p>
<p>Ritisha you are the cutest neighbor I could have asked for, I'm not going to elaborate on your cuteness now coz everyone knows that. I clearly remember the first time I heard you singing in first year, it took me more than 5 minutes to realize that it was "Numb" :P I don't know why you stopped later on, I used to enjoy that. And you're like the only one on the entire floor with lights on at 3 in the morning, giving me company staying up. I'll miss teasing you, calling you stupid, discussing "friends", cracking those horrible offensive jokes, bitching (guess that was the best part). Don't go you stupid girl! :(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>Ritisha- Hmm where to start ?? For the  large part of my two years in campus ,she was alien to me; however for the next part of two months I had one hell of experience with her in PS.Whether during the office hoodo, non-stop roaming around , epic lunch sessions, long travel journeys, randomest movie plans,I never felt that I haven't known her for long.Getting home food ( Sindhi but still :P ) whenever I wished, having to give numerous treats on the randomest reasons,MCd's sessions,just wish reliving it allover once again. About her, no one is as sporty she is,she is breath of fresh air, sometimes so carefree that I get envy of her.All of you know that she is intelligent and cute ,however the best part is being a part of the "Pun sessions" on silliest of  topics. No over would ever take the pain of listening my poor PJ's, weird tales, accompanying for the coffee sessions,encouraging to find ways out of trouble, the way she does without a word of complaining. Mumma,will miss you sorely and the void which you would leave behind is next to impossible to fill. 4-2 dare to be busy with your silly plans,else will kill you( I mean it). Best of luck with life,hope you do well where you go, forgetting me-not an option !!!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>The sweetest person I have ever met. When you first meet her she kinda comes forward as an arrogant, moody kinda person, but as you get to know her, you realize the exact opposite is true :D The first time I met her was for Quark Miscellaneous (a.k.a Elixir :P ) and it was an absolute pleasure working under her. I remember if I ever began slacking in my work, she kinda got kinda strict , but then added a ":P" after the sentence to not come out as rude. :P From tips related to PS, to anything in general, she has always been there to help .
Wishing you all the luck for all your future endeavors.
Best,
GSN
