<p>The 'Ritwik Sahoo'-this guy needs no introduction.He is undoubtedly the joker of our group.I haven't met a soul in this campus who remains as unperturbed as Ritwik when it comes to dealing with difficult situations and this includes situations where he is a subject of mockery :P. A true corporate guy-his management skills have earned him much respect amongst his peers.His dedication saw him take over as the Events Head in Quark 2012 and take it to new levels.He is a very professional guy and has all the traits of becoming an exceptional business personality.He doesn't care about what others say about him and does his own thing.All the best to you man!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>Haven't seen a person who takes to his work more ferociously. A workaholic, he won't rest until he has the thing the way he wants it. A true friend, ever helpful at all times. He takes his future seriously and has planned out ahead for the next 10 years atleast :P.  Completely unconcerned about public opinion about himself allows him to do things out-of the-boz and make them a runaway success. Learnt a lot from him. Hope he stays the way he is and remains a dear friend forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Sahoo - The events coordinator. That's how I've known him. He thinks different, and he does different. One of the coolest things about him is his lack of concern over what others think of him. He's strongly focused, and has the traits to be an entrepreneur someday. Wish you success in your journey ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>

<p>"Mere liye testimonial mat likhna because I'm too lazy to write one for you..." but anyways I have decided not to listen to you once again. He is that one crazy person who'll just pop into your room anytime of the day and say " Arvind yaar I need inspiration" or "I want you to write my biography" or "I'm going to rule this world" ROFLMAO. But on a serious note, despite all his craziness, Sahoo has emerged a successful leader, a talented techie and will definitely be a great entrepreneur. I know that he'll definitely do something or the other out-of-the-box stuff after college, so all the best with that :) Enjoy & Keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Sahoo! My sidey for 3 years, and ya another sem, as we got the rooms together in CH1 too. He is another of the very unique personalities I came across after coming to BITS. He has this devil-may-care attitude towards what other people think about him, which really is a big weapon he posses as it allows him to focus more on his work. A man of high values when it comes to his work, friends or duties and the one who would chillax the most when it would be off-season for his main work. He still has his sleep cycle intact even after slogging like hell for all of three quarks we have seen, and being in election commision, and being the cg club head, and being the events head of the biggest quark ever and other innumerous things he does. A really fun to be with person, Sahoo will always surprise you with the new things/theories he would come up with, though a lot(read majority) of them become objects of fun and laughter in our group :P , some of them really do turn out to be good and he works his heart out to make that thing work. I haven't really seen someone work so hard for anything that interests him, its like we all say here ' apna tan man aur dhan sab laga deta hai sahoo kaam mein ' . Let me make it clear to you that the frequency of his jokes turning out to be foot-in-mouth(rather feet-in-mouth) or PJ's is incredibly high(:P). But once in a year or twice he does come up with a prank/joke which more or less makes up for what he has lost out otherwise. All that said and done, he earns his respect with sheer hard work and I wish him all the success in life and expect to see him running his own big enterprise.

<p>Ritwik Sahoo, what to write about this very good friend of mine. Met him in my 1st year when we were working together for Quark. From those days itself, he has his own ideals, and his own way of doing things. He is extremely hard-working, and enthusiastic personality. Though personally I got to know him only a year back much therefore can't write much but professionally he's a good team manager. He's those kind of people who listens to everyone but do as per what they, for which I appreciate him the most. A very good friend who is always ready to help you. I wish him all the very best for a strong future :D     <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>

<p>Sahoooooo..!!! I got to know him in my 1-1 and better still in my 1-2. I feel sad he wasn't around much in 2011-12. But still, I guess I am very certain about a few things. The very first word that comes to my head when I try to define him by his qualities is "die-hard workaholic". He is also highly motivated and brimming with ideas. He is an extremely helpful person, I still remember how he lent me his formals trousers, even when he needed them for his farewell the next day. He has been a great mentor and I have always been informal around him. I guess he's the only senior whom I don't address by 'bhaiyya', maybe out of love and attachment, no, surely out of love and attachment. I am so sure when I say that he is going to go miles ahead in his life through his ideas, practicality and zest for work. He has always entertained my problems, even at 3 in the night and believed in me.
Sahoo, one of my most treasured moments of Quark 2011 will be when we had done publicity of that fuel-cell development workshop, pasting short paras on thousands of facebook pages of random colleges. You never give up, even we had an astronomical target of getting 150 participants for that 5000 rupee-workshop and I said it wasn't possible. And I remember how you worked day and night to get more than 176..!!! It was a changing moment in my  life when I accepted that things can work out even if I don't believe in them. You will always be my mentor and I always look up to you. I am very sure you don't need any luck, but if at all it helps, best of luck for the future. Stay in touch, yaar, loads of love. :-) :-)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kachhy">Kachhy</a></p>
