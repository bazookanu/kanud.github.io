<h1 class="page-title">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</h1><p>Dear Kawley, you are a true ACP (A very Creative Person). Acting, Singing, Dancing....just name it and you have all the qualities!!!! You are a true example of an all-rounder, great in acads and even better in extra-curriculars. But what really sets you apart is that despite being so talented, you are one of the kindest persons I have met on campus. Being one of my best friends on campus, you have helped me whenever i needed your help and we have a lot of pleasant memories together, one of them being working together for Maharashtra Mandal. The fact that you do not swear even in the worst of situations speaks volumes of how mature a person you are. Words fall short to describe you Kawley, I would just like to thank you for being such a close friend of mine and I am sure we will carry on this friendship for many years to come....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>A really talented person, extremely good natured friend. I first met Rohan on an MM trip to Netravali. A great actor, director,script writer, editor, he is like an entire film crew compressed in one person!(The Kawley right hand rule is probably more famous than Satam's!) I have had the good fortune of working with this President of MM for one year. During this time ,I have come to respect him as a person and person, and of course, as the President! All the Best, Rohan :))<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>The thing that I like about him the most is the way he thinks out of the box which makes him a very creative person. He has got the stamina which allows him to sit in the library for hours and days.I have really enjoyed playing box cricket in his colony. A die hard cricket fan who used to bring his bat even in rainy season (when we used to gather to play football). A safe driver and the most important of all, he is the supplier of food (that also for free :P) for me and Rane during late night hours. He never gets angry (forget that one incident with the knife :P). He is famous in the corridor for his "Rainbow" wardrobe collection. A person with excellent skills in MSOffice( I have never seen anyone so pro in Word Excel etc.). He is a strong believer of the saying " Actions speak louder than words". So we get to see lot of "action" instead of words. A very open person and of course a born leader....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>The first thing he asked me was, "why don't you speak in marathi??".....and that is how we met....i never thought that we would be such good friends but i am glad that we did....rohan is the most mature guy i have come across(sometimes i call him "aajobaa"), his theories mostly go over my head :P.....he talks to me more on the chat than in person(i still remember our saree bet :P)....but he is a really sweet guy, always calm and patient, has strong opinions, and is a really great friend!!....Wish you all the best for everything!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-dighe">Priyanka Dighe</a></p>
<p>Kawley is a very creative person. When you mention Kawley and dont speak about Sachin Tendulkar I think it would be one of the world's greatest sin! He is a die hard fan on Sachin. One thing I remember, once he had said that he will definitely see Sachin's final match and during that time world cup final was considered the last match for Sachin. And yes, he saw that match..LIVE! :)
Many people may not know this, except my wingmates, there this dailogue of Kawley which I often hear "Doon min"(2mins)..there isnt a single day I hvnt heard this dailogue! His room is d official stationary shop plus d shopping complex of our floor! Those late night hours, were completely dependent on Kawley's biscuits. He has been one of my closest friends on campus and I am sure we will carry on this friendship for a long time...Thank you for everything and all the best for all our future endeavours! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shrenik-khot">Shrenik Khot</a></p>
<p>Kawley - yaar dosta jinklas!! Rohan Heemanshu Kawley is one of the closest friends of mine on Campus, (so close that he is on speed dial). He is that guy of the group who takes his own time to get ready, but if you tell him in advance he will be the guy to be there at the exact moment. I believe he was one of my friends who was most happy when Sachin finally scored his 100th century. Apart from that he is a sincere hard working guy who is generous and if he is come from his is the room to be in, especially after festival. The late nights spent in my or Sathe's or mama's room playing cards/business and those special Kawley moments when Sathe would take his own time to play his card!! This ACP was one of the finest and true gentlemen I have met in my life!! All the Best Rohan!! God Bless!!

<p>What a wonderful guy he is... The ACP, as he is commonly known.... Rohan Kawley brings with him his ecstatic and brilliant persona with a charming smile and gait... A guy who loves to be creative.... A person who is very honest and trustworthy.. You give him gold and he will never snatch it from you... An excellent dramatist... loves to act .. And has got his own creations like small plays and dialogues.. you must hear one from him the next time you meet him... !! Its so awesome.. I remember the way this guy had recited one of the dialogues of Shivaji Maharaj on the way to hostel... Fully involved in it.. It was Epic to hear that...A truly hard working chap even though sometimes curses the work.. :P.. An extremely brainy fellow this guy is.. !!! A total night canteen freak!!... A person who daily "attends" (LOL!) the night canteen as if its in his daily chores Most of the times eating Dosa and Shev Puri.and also some juice... A total food lover.. Has a vivid taste... And an awesome choice... :).. A person who is very very very particular at doing things.. If he wants a juice after lunch, he will have it...  Even his own things must be fed up of him by now.. :P A very softspoken person and a kind person by nature he stands out brilliantly with his non-selfish attitude.. A person whom you can surely turn to if you have no money.. Always bears huge amount of cash with him... :P... You may get many treats.. :)... A die hard Sachin fan.. I got a treat when Sachin scored that double hundred in ODI... :) :P A true ice cream lover... I remember the days of "Sachmuch AAM" :P... Anuva really put you into habbit of it..:P A man who wants to always win.. NEVER-SAY-DIE and VICTORY-SHALL-BE-MINE attitude.. Gets angry when someone wins over him... Be it marks, a game of cards, anything... An awesome guy to hang out with especially if you are a lover of cricket.. My God... Anything can get him started on Sachin... A true Ricky Ponting hater... Will kill him if he sees Ponting... (One of his arguments being "Ponting was the worst captain" :P)  A guy who is pretty strong on his opinions... no one can come in his way.. A true friend after all... Hats off to you... Keep it up .. Be the same... Be awesome.. All the best for your bright career.. :) Last but not the least, Thank you very much for being such a great friend and giving me some awesome lifelong memories to cherish... :) All the best..!!!

<p>Kawley! Rohan is a great guy and I always have fun chatting with him! We start talking on something and land up chatting about completely random things on the planet.!
He marofy-s some really great one-liners :D
Rohan is an amazing dramatist and has put up some amazing performances. I remember Big Break in our 2-1 when he did the ACP Pradyuman role! I laughed my guts on on that hilarious performance. Hats off to you, Rohan for that!
Your secrets shall always remain secrets with me! No worries on that at all!
He performed his duties as the MM President phenomenally. All the events of the year were great! I missed some, but I heard they were a huge success, thanks to Kawley and his team!
Our farewell pics have come out amazing, What say? :) :)
And I love the Kawley Kawley cum Pradyuman pic of ours!
This guy, I know, shall do great things in life. Stay the same and wish you all the luck in the world!
Cheers, =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/namrata-nadkarni">Namrata Nadkarni</a></p>
<p>Kaw Kaw Kaw, now I get your blog :P He is awesome, I have admired his acting skills from the day he portrayed ACP in the CID sketch :) We have our moments here and there, which crack me up immediately, with either some dialogue in "shudh hindi" or some other random stuff. He has often consulted with me for art advice, which I thank him for ( makes me feel important :P). His style combined with his subtle sense of humor is definitely going to take him places which are meant for special people like him. Enjoy and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Kawley......... Never knew this guy in the first year. Saw him first time on stage when he performed as ACP Pradyuman and since then you have always remained ACP for me (with that epic hand movement) I really came to know him recently and realized he is an exceedingly humble person (from what I understand this guy is 'loaded') A person full of antics he is fun to have around, always doing some bullshit to keep the group entertaining. A true cricket fan he even went to Mumbai to watch the WorldCup (final i think) and he is in complete awe of Sachin, as most mumbaikars are (apparently there's nothing better in mumbai :P) A true friend, he can be relied upon for help, support and trust. I have taken full advantage of him, eating all MM food for farewells :P Wishing you a very successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Rohan dada  ur the unique in ur own style ...it had been great wrking with u for MM and  drama club. :))

may u lead a happy and a prosperous life.
best wishes-- roopal<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/roopal-joshi">roopal joshi</a></p>
<p>Only reason i am gonna remember this guy for is screwing up  my analog labs.........output aa gaya, but ruko, daal mein kuch kaalaa lag raha hai,  lemme see....ummmm......and maan lo jaise output kaa khoon ho gaya ho.....voh vaapas nahi aayega, kuch bhi karlo ....and result--->> marx==000 a.k.a zero a.k.a shoonya  (just kidding, actually, it was fun wrking wid u  :P )...Rohan a.k.a. ACP Kawley...is the only marathi guy in the drama club i know of. Staring at him even for the slightest moment in the library or in the mess can cause a lot of trouble to you. he'll start staring back straightaway with his flemming's right hand rule waali pose and the hand keeps rotating and rotating and rotating (anticlockwaise or clockwise, dont remember the direction, sry )...colourful baniyans are his identity.. kawley is one of those who follow sachinist philosophy, who would ignore lab work, and take time to send sms, just to check if sachin has scored his 100th 100 or not. even though i dont watch cricket much, one  thing i will always be jealous of kawley is for winning world cup 2011 final tickets and more importantly, india won that cup.......lucky kawley!!!. and as rightly said by rishabh, he doesnt mind if u come for mm farewells (actually, i shud've taken advantage of that  :P). Jokes apart, kawley is a very humble guy, who doesnt have the so-called "attitude". he is one guy i've never seen gettin angry.  he always likes to do things "thoda hatke" style. his acting skills, are no doubt, very _/\_. kawley is also a very good dancer, as i've seen myself during mm practice. he is one guy who shud be present with u while u r at a DJ night. U'll definitely learn some new dancing moves.!! he also manages to balance acads and drama club very well, and performs well in xams. he will be here in campus in 4-1, while i am away for ps2. so, u will be missed kawley !! wishing u best of luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>

<p>Kawley, passionate at whatever he does. Anyone who has met Kawley knows how particular he is about everything, his attire, his resume(i didn't know you could do all that in word :P), the food. Everytime you ask him if wants to go to the mess, he'll enquire about the minutest details ( which includes whether the papad is fried or roasted). It is a very big deal if Kawley says h A die hard Sachin fan he is. It is always fun taking his case over Sachin and his retirement. A very good actor, writer and director. Probably why he is known as ACP instead of Kawley. He is the one who introduced me to Sachmuch AAM, thanks a ton for that :). Rohan Kawley, you will be truly missed. Thanks for always being there. All the best for your future.
