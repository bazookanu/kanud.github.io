<h1 class="page-title">Rohan Khanduja</h1><p>Khanduu ,
Honestly did not know how you became DEPP chief Co in the beginning :P
But Seriously mann u are one awesome guy. The number of innovations and different things you have done for publicity of fests are just awesome. Kudos to you for that. Learnt thinking out of the box from you, That's just one side of the coin.The other side is the COOl and Party animal :)  , All those CoCo outings , and SPREE dhamal that we had, i will never forget. Just Keep thinking out of the box and PARTY hard like you always do. All the Best for your Future and Stay in Touch :) .

<p>DePP inductions next year, well that was my plan at the end of two semesters. Little did I know that my small stint in Social Media would land me there before the campus reopened. There was no looking back after that. There have been many people who shaped me in my second year, but the person I feel who played the biggest role is Rohan Khanduja. People know him for his wild partying side, but catch him when he is drunk and he will teach you the tricks of the trade. No nonsense, no pretense. He is the best critic one can have. People say "I don't give a fuck", he lives it. It might sound outrageous, but he is the modern day Sadhu who orgasmisizes life. Hope we carry your legacy forward. May life always entertain you.

<p>Where do i begin.. For the first 2 months that we knew each other we barely spoke. But when we did start talking it felt like i had missed out on something for the last 2 months. He's one of the people i owe my first encounter with alcohol to :P And all the hindi gaalis i know are thanks to this guy. I remember the amount you took my case about Pune being in the South and how mad it made me! There are so many memories, with Sharang, Rippan and shubhankar. All the useless hours spent at nescafe, the numerous Bogmalo outings, with crazy drunken memories, i still cant believe we went drinking in the middle of t1 and t2! The face painting competition, 1st year Waves, 1st year holi when we had Bhaang for the first time, the Baga trip when we went para sailing and on the banana boat ride, all the times in pune, and of course Cad b, after all the hype that i had created about it. When i heard you had become chief coordi for DEPP, no offense but i was surprised, i had no idea you had worked so much in one year. But honestly, you did a wonderful job with it :) You've been such an important part of my life in Bits, so many memories, happy and some not so happy as well, but i'm really glad that we can be such good friends even now. Thanks for all those memories. You shall be missed :)
P.S : We'll totally find you another sardarni girl :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
