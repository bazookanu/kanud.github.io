<p>rohit.... sorry.....kejri......is undoubtedly the wealthiest guy in campus and yet so humble and down to earth.....which is quite evident from his all time empty purse....  :P
well.....mochu is cute panda of our group......funny ...caring ...dedicated and hard working guy.... and sooooo cute!!!!
college has its own effect on every1... in keez's case.....it turned him from a simple vegetarian to "occasional" smoker alcoholic and meat eater....
ab college me har dusre din koi na koi occasion to rehta hi hai....!!....isme keez ki kya galti...

we did share many awesome moments.....almost all trips we had were special although some were exceptional......
our first nite out..(saala dude bolna bhul jate hain...  :P )....bike race to karnataka......and then running for life on the lonely tracks.....
chemical trip......sutta moments......and the cards time...... :-*
..... assigning random girl to each other and then calling names whenever she would pass by.....  :P ..... 

....those train journeys.........I always took the longer route to home...(smtyms 20 hrs difference..).....just to take the journey with you guys.....and trust me..it was totally worth it..!!......that awesome sleeper class trip in winter..... me nd shashi....U nd harsh...nd pandit and govindam....sharing berth........ and then teasing each other all nite long..... :P .... ...
