<p>Tomar is a decent, easy going guy and a great friend. A jogger with a decent stamina. An enthusiastic DJ nite dancer and a decent singer. You may find him usually whining about the sad things in his life. He is never fully satisfied which may be a good quality because he always wants the best. He is a very helpful guy who has helped me with my assignments and has also taught me MuP before compre. He is a great guy to hang out with . He might have patented the phrase gm as you may always find him saying it to someone or the other. A great performer in acads but he always treats himself lesser than others. He is a dear friend and I am surely going to miss him. All the best for your life ahead bro and have a great one. Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rajat-koujalagi">Rajat Koujalagi</a></p>
<p>Meet the official leader/president of our club( don't bother asking which, its a secret society :P),anyways every group has its own "fattu" guy and tomar is ours :D,Placements is one thing that seems to always be in the back of his mind right from year one and thats what drives him to work diligently for his exams, good thing for me though, woudn't have completed those countless assignments without your help and and of course ladda the great on whom we all relied :D,anyways enough for the boring part,Tomar's a great guy to hang out with, who can ever forget those unforgettable bogmalo nights and the revolving skies and trees :P, and ofcourse the awesome bike and numerous beach trips which we have had, Tomar is serious at times but he is the kind of person without whom a party just doesn't feel right, "gm" seems to be his favourite word, come on who says "gm" to a guy who's taking a bath, only our great Tomar no doubt,all said and done these three years with him and our group have been three BEST years of my life and there's not a hint of exaggeration in that,Cheers to you mate, have a great life ahead.....aur itna tension mat le place ho jaayega tu, coz you're the one and only "pro" :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustoov-dutta">Koustoov Dutta</a></p>
<p>The first time I met Tomar I thought he was loud… I never thot I would gel so well with him. But I ended up spending three years of my life with him which were priceless. It has been a fantastic journey and will cherish this for my entire life. The time spent in ur room with baba, hj, mg, Shakti, alien, kunal discsng the chudaaps and evrytime u peeping in ur watch to see the time and ask us to leave and we cared even lesser each time.
For those who don’t  kno him…he is very helpful, selfless(kind of), very  sincere and hard working. But as a real good friend I cud only see him crying for marks, exams(though he is always finished with the syllabus 5 days b4 xam), if its raining in the morning, he wont go out the whole day thinking it mite rain again and he cud get cold (in his style…yaar ZUKHAM ho jayega baarish ho gayi to).
I cud keep writing abt the times I hav spent with u. U hav been very a important part of my life( I kno its sounding abit gay but its ok). Will never forget the times spent with u and the club.
PS: Do not forget the deal we have :D

<p>Emotional, sensitive and down to earth person. I spent almost one-fourth of my campus life in his room along with HJ,Baba and Sujat discussing and analysing our weird activities ( chudaaps ). He is a great person but spents most of his tym in crying for the stuffs he can’t do. A self-proclaimed fattu, he is the leader ( contrasting features from a leader ) of our grp. Acc. to him he lived in great hardship which is evident from the fact that he had never eaten anything sold on ‘THELA’ and had rarely travelled in SL coach let alone the general class. He has been my jogging companion for almost 2 yrs nw and some of the discussions during that tym were truly memorable. He is the safest person to be with because when u r with him u can be sure that u r nowhere near danger ( he never goes to any at least in frnt of us ). All in all it had been an awesome journey along with him and others and I wouldn’t or rather couldn’t forget any of the legendary things we have done in past 3 yrs for my entire life. I wish him a great, successful and prosperous life ahead……. Njoy life brother!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>

<p>Tomar, kya bolun bhai tere baare mein! I seriously regret I din know this great whiny personality for long time. I know him for one semester only and we get along right away. (In a way its good coz it saved me lot of brain damage :P ) Kidding man! you are an awesome friend and a cool guy to talk with. Its a shame you r going for PS next sem. Will definitely miss you and I wish you great luck in life. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>rohit tomar aka fattu aka army da puttar (:P).. he is the most unique guy, having an army background, that i ever met.. as the nick 'fattu' suggests, he is always anxious of anything surrounding him (itni tension mat le bhai).. you are the only guy i have met (except for mothers) who cries after he hits someone.. your room has become an 'adda' for us.. it is like a homely place to me and i am sure to all the others who have spent such wonderful time of their lives doing chudaap in your room.. it is fun when you retaliate us from entering your room for 'chudaap time'.. you have been the source of many good songs i had not heard before, but stop singing those songs please (especially with the expressions) :P.. you are one of the hard working persons who has been unlucky from time to time, but stop blaming me for that (all that were "co-incidences").. you have always been the 'leader' of the group whether you accept it or not and the decisions such as choosing mess, choosing whether or not to leave baba (:D), planning trip, etc. have been made by you.. apart from that, u are the most 'rotlu' guy i have seen (placements, acads, marks, bad luck, bhai kitna roega)..  and the most interesting part is your favourite greeting, which is 'gm' (and most of u will know it does not mean good morning).. u have taught this greeting to others and now it has spread wide (seriously, jo bhi milta hai pehle gm bolta hai.. wtf).. i can write endlessly about you but i think it will bore people.. it was awesome spending 3 years of my life with you and i hope you will be less anxious in the future.. just remember what you always say 'sab moh maaya hai'.. aur haan sun: "GM" :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jain-himanshu-hemant">JAIN HIMANSHU HEMANT</a></p>
<p>One of the most chilled people you will ever come across who can easily connect with everyone. Our trips to Hyderabad with Kaiko, God & Nakli will always be remembered by all of us and that ringtone of yours that Nakli just couldn't stop playing. A very hard working and humble person whom I admire very much. It is sad that you'll be going for PS in a different semester than me. But we will always be in contact wherever we go. May you achieve all that aspire, Best of Luck!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>One of the most namakool guys one can come across. Still a very good friend of mine. Always worries a little too much about acads still knows how to have fun. A bit fattu but a heart of gold. I still remember the Mup compre exam where I went to his room and inspite of his need to score Avg+20 he still helped me with the syllabus. Always be the guy you are man and score an awesome job. I know you will. Thats all for now Army ka beta. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>Rohit Tomar is a jolly, fun loving guy. He is always enthusiastic about everything. The best thing about him is that he knows how to enjoy life and does it in the best way. He is simple, down to earth and there are no walls of pride and pretension when you are talking to him. It has been 3 yrs living in front of him and I feel there couldn't have been a better person than him as my neighbour, well mainly because he has TOLERATED all the wonderful songs composed and sung by this wonderful singer of the upcoming generation i.e. ME! :P BTW Tomar, I have composed a new song dedicated to you :P Ofcourse its the usual kind ;)

This person is always helpful and a true friend. He has great quality of leadership, no doubt he is the president of a CERTAIN CLUB :P He is a wonderful CS player and a Headshot Specialist. He is always crying (I mean, not literally crying!) about something or the other, but even in those moments also, the environment of fun and freedom he maintains around him is really marvelous. He posseses this great ability of cracking weird jokes when everyone is paying attention and cracking really wonderful jokes when noone is paying attention :P I could get them coz I am usually the guy just listening to the talking.

His room has been the Headquarter of the CERTAIN CLUB ever since the first year. Whenever I come out of my room, I hear people talking, discussing, laughing, cracking jokes and it has been a wonderful experience. One of the best qualities of Rohit is his singing. Unlike me, he has a great voice and he sings with emotions. Infact, Rohit is my GURU when it comes to singing, no doubt I sing so well now :P I wish you a great and successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>tomar................ gm! if you hvnt met the chu club leader.. u've missed a lot.when i first met him,never thot he would be so much fun to be around.he has been a gr8 neighbour for these 3 years.. these moments will always be remembered.hes got a number of trademark words too ..... "movefau"... "bade log!!"...."ch** gayi,ch** gayi"... "soraeyyy"...."gm".... and before every dinner...."chalo chalo".also,he might hv used this line on u..."tu bachpan se aisa hai ya abhi hua hai :D " .......these memories are just irreplaceable.very hardworking..but never gets results :P  he underestimates his potential..and thts his biggest weakness.mayb a little positive thinking.. and he could achieve so much more.im really gonna miss him.. hvnt met ppl like him before (no..im not sarcastic right nw :P ).cheers to our friendship..hope u hv a gr8 life ahead.njoy!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunal-sharma">kunal sharma</a></p>
<p>I can proudly say him to be my first friend at campus, and rightly so, one cannot escape the charm that he spills with his first impression. Ambitious, cooperative, hardworking and a little insecure (actually very much :P) he is the center of attraction in any group he might be standing in. A self-proclaimed singer, he has a good voice (compared to other singers in the corridor, not so much on a national level :D) and taste in music that some might even be jealous of. Frankly speaking its hard to come across such an individual in life and when you find one, you keep him for a lifetime, so will I. Hope this friendship lasts forever.. I cannot think of a better complement than the truth that the club wouldn’t have been what it is, without you… hope you enjoy all the success you deserve in your life… stay in touch... and best of luck.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shakti-thakran">Shakti Thakran</a></p>
