<p>Ronak aka R.J is an awesome guy and one of my best pals…. His, part kiddish part EVIL :D giggle is probably the first thing you notice …. His wit and humor always manage to cheer up the people around him…. Quite a mischievous guy,  you can never let your guard down with him around … He is a  true genius,  who  can learn just about anything in no time at all and is full of original ideas…. He is one of those few guys who genuinely start studying during the last hours and still manage to ace the tests …. also happens to be a phodu gamer, phodu coder  etc … yet his simplicity, kind heartedness  and down to earth nature is admirable. He is also a very courageous  guy who is not afraid to stand up for himself or his friends .I am sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to … wish you a bright future buddy :) …. will thoroughly miss you. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gokul-v--shetty">Gokul V  Shetty</a></p>
