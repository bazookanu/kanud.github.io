<h1 class="page-title">Rounak Jain</h1><p>Donky! You are THE MOST annoying person I have ever met! But strangely, I think I'm going to miss that part of you the most. I will always remember the three of us hanging out at the fork, all our outings, going to Vainguinim, eating excessively at Kashi, eating at dominoes (you hypocrite!) all the Italian food :P, group chats, playing moment of truth, your super awesome English and your techie interests, the apple-android wars that would go on for ages, even meeting at Mumbai n going for movies, us forcing you to get a haircut, playing with those silly apps and games on your phone, Univirtual and even the times you used to take my case n tease me were so much fun.  Apart from all that, you are a very interesting person to talk to, very smart, and above all, a wonderful person inside, and one of my closest friends on campus. Do keep in touch. Will miss you loads!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tara-ramanan">Tara Ramanan</a></p>
<p>Rouank Jain, the guy who is super picky about food, crazy about his iPhone and can probably not even survive a day without the internet! I clearly remember that DoSM trip to Majorda in first year where you refused to eat naan, I guess that was around the time when we started speaking. My first impression about you was that this guy won't stop once he starts speaking! And all those horrible yet extremely funny jokes, which I still get a lot from you and I hope it stays like that. There are so many brilliant memories I have with you and I don't think I can fit even one tenth of them here. Few worth mentioning would be those long hours we waited outside the placement office, Tara-ragging sessions, all those Mumbai-movie trips and the amazing Goa ones too! I'm always going to miss those small trips to vasco and the stupid arguments that are so damn hard to win! I've learnt so much from you in these last few years. Thanks for being there. Lots of love! :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>Pandu ! This forehead covered iphone maniac is truly a weird creature to meet and be friends with. Always on net surfing random things reading blogs and then writing his views and EARNING loads of cash on them - his true college life in one line. For people who dont know, he is a simple witty humble guy but he a bit opposite to what people know, when its someone's bday he shall be the first one to pounce and kick that chap, in audi his voice can be heard above all the other noise, the way he shouts in corridor is what most people arent aware of. Always ready to help and share views on various ideas and random things I usually share with him. His guy can work in Marketing and do marvels but he is least interested in that now, wants to be the best tech blogger of India ? 
One bad thing about him is he is a true Jain so he doesnt eat any food outside in veg nonveg serving restaurants, so cudnt go out and have parties with him. I am sure in 4-1 one day he will get drunk on Bogmalo, its must and dont miss that opportunity man ! 
He is one of the few people whom I have come across on campus, who loves their work and devote time to their passions and hobbies without cribbing. 
Oh yeah, I remember asking him to come for cricket and the whole lot of people were astonished to see Pandu outside his room playing, he usually is 24hrs in his room or busy on walks. His views and critical comments on each and every topic are good but humorous too at times.  
All the best man for your future, may you work for Apple one day ! 
PS. Bogmalo once before you leave campus please.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Bugger! Physics Pro, that's what i got to know you as :P I remember the way you used to blurt out answers in Radhika Vatsan's class :-/ Then came Physics-II, you got 52 in T1 and that was my course total /\ Someday, one fine day i'm going to beat your Tiny Wings score :P and yeah i'm still higher than you in Doodle Jump :P Rounak, can you give me your iPhone for a while? I wanna play Tap Tap!! ;) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>
<p>The neighbour I hardly get to see anymore! Physics pro, CS enthusiast and a total tech geek, his love for all things Apple is pretty well known. He's perpetually locked up in his room, reading/writing blogs, watching sitcoms, coding, studying and singing out loud along with songs at odd hours. He only comes out to to go for classes or to the library. Or at 4AM, looking for water. Quiet, intelligent, smart, witty and hilariously sarcastic - it's always great to have him around, especially when he goes into foul-language mode! Wishing you all the very best for life!
