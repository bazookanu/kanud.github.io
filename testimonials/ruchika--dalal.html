<p>Sweet and nice by nature, she is fun loving and humorous. She is soft spoken, helpful, caring, stable and level-headed. She has a warm contagious smile. She is a big fan of 
Vampire diaries. She is a cool person to hangout with. Well balanced. She is a friend who can be completely relied upon. Will miss her as my DOPY :P. With her good, innocent nature and hard-work she is sure to achieve great heights in future and may we remain friends forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>Ruchika. She comes across as a person who has almost all the qualities of a good friend. She is always ready to help her friends no matter how big the problem is! A fun loving girl, she loves to chat and gossip. She is caring and a very humble person. I have never seen her in a quarrel with anyone. She is intelligent. She is smart. And I mean smart in every aspect. Above all, a down-to-earth person. I wish her all the very best for her future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>
<p>Ruchika-the first thing I noticed about her is her beautiful, dimpled smile. It goes all the way upto her eyes. We became friends during PS-1, when we were stuck in that small room with an AC that kept tripping every 10 minutes. Remember how we took turns to start it? :P She's very talkative, even though she doesn't look like it. Me and Surbhi, especially Surbhi, used to just sit and listen to her talk on and on about everyone, we now know all her friends, even her friends from her society and her school. :P
She's so sweet she'd let us read all her messages. Infact that was our favourite timepass during lunch break :P. Thank you so much for making PS-1 bearable. All the fun we've had, all the trips in Maharsi's car and all
the Salsa sessions(she always made me do the guy part :P) will be cherished. All the best for your future. Keep smiling your dimpled smile...always!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jeffy-joseph">Jeffy Joseph</a></p>
<p>Hey gtalk buddy!! She is a fun loving person, very friendly, down to earth, caring and cute :D. Its fun chatting with her on gtalk.....sometimes we end up chatting for hours. She is very talkative and too good at asking random Q's. Will be chatting with her and talking about something n suddenly she will ask so random q which will be like nowhere related to anything we will be talking. :P

Most of the time when i will ping her she will be watching some tv series, she says that....i don't know thts true or nt coz her image n grades reflect that she is too "PADHAKU". Probability of finding her on campus outside her hostel is almost nil!! I my self saw her for the 1st time in my trw class.....after being on campus for 2 yrs!! 

She shows some extra-ordinary love for mumbai, may be thts y even after coming here where you can find people from all different places.....her all crushes are from mumbai :P. She a fun loving person. Very cute & caring friend. She fights a lot!! :D

Hope you get married to one of your crushes :P. Always be in touch gtalk buddy!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
