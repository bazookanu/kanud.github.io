<h1 class="page-title">Rujuta Salunkhe</h1><p>Ruju!!! My absent-minded, absolutely-clumsy, living in a different dimension, but strong-willed, opinionated, always-willing-to-help, cheerful friend!! (phew!)....a BIG sherlock devotee :) ...a person who wears a blazer on her farewell :) ...who bumps into walls and trips on plane surfaces :) ...who's always willing to listen :) ....who gives her all to what she does :) ...even though i tell you to, pls don't change!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-repal">Neha Repal</a></p>
<p>Rujuta is one of the most creative and absent-minded people I know! The latter has resulted in her being called ‘mabbu’. A big fan of Sherlock Holmes, a believer of “I can do anything a guy can do” and a camera-phobic person are some of the first things that come to mind. Inspite of being from the same department(DoPY), we only got to know each other in the second year. I think our first shared class(after I knew her) was Bio MT and I remember her asking me, “you scared of blood?”. Besides BITS, our experiences in Chennai, like following Google maps to the middle of nowhere, and being dragged by her in public for taking her pic(which was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life!) will never be forgotten! You are a great friend and will be missed...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p>Ruju .. very straightforward innocent girl I met on campus. I often see her made fun of in a group and the best part is she doesn't even realize it :). Then someone says " Rujuuuuuu!!!". And ruju's expression is like "Ohk I'm back into the three dimension world :D". My piano pal in 2nd year :)  Very sweet person . And our gully cricket team captain :) I remember all the good moments we had together. All the best to you .. keep in touch :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes, Pirates,  Transformers,  cartoons,  …. This is a glimpse into the whimsical world of Rujuta aka “mabbu” of DOPY . If you find her lost in thoughts  anytime,  this is where she dwells :P …I do not remember talking to her  before 1-2,  Thanx to Dopy that I met a person like her. I got to know her much better as a person while working with her in dopy. Initially I was a little startled to see a person so much into the world of fantasy, movies, fictional characters … but very soon realized that this  is not the only side of her …   One of the “nothing is impossible” kind of things was making the hostel video for zephyr in the midnight.  That was when I came to know about  the creative side of rujuta.  Even though we struggled a lot that day, it was great fun working with u and bari … rightly said  ” hardword pays off” as we made one of the best hostel videos.  Dopy gradually opened different facets of  “mabbu” … Her writing skills are amazing and she is one of the few people who can easily think out of the box anytime anywhere.  A very dedicated, hardworking, organized and who does not like to do things the other’s way.  This is all I can think about our 2nd year. Coming to the 3rd. She was the obvious choice for the creative director of DOPY and I enjoyed working with her  throughout in Dopy.  Il always remember the long fun filled discussions in mess about your fanciful dreams … your future … and yeah .. plz do remember the bet we had … m sure goin to win it. :P . She is a girl who roams around with a Swiss knife in her bag … a girl who has an extra body part  ( “the bag” ) attached to her (thankfully did not get it to farewell too :P) .. a girl who loves to live alone but is very scared of spooky things … a girl who thinks she can win over any boy .. a girl who curses herself for being a girl :P …. On the other hand she is a very helpful, fun loving cheerful and a down to earth person … It was always a pleasure being with her … she would just take away my worries with her funny stories … Its really hard to find a person lyk her … truly “one of a kind” … Going to miss all the fun that we had .. be it in Dopy or hostel … Wish you a good luck for your future …n hope to see my friend as an IAS/IPS ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pooja-anand">Pooja Anand</a></p>
<p>Rujuta! Friends since 1st year MM performance, close friends since 2nd year when she joined DoPY and best friends since our PS1 in Chennai… Where do I start.. There is so much I know about her that I can write a book probably :P To start with her normal characteristics.. A GREAT Sherlock Holmes fan (cum lover :P).. very enthusiastic mechanical engineer(has done summer internship in a mech company, works on softwares out of interest).. adventure lover (goes trekking AT LEAST once a year).. loves open jeeps (is dreaming of getting one if she wins THE BET)… Coming to her ‘mabbu’ness (please don’t mind (as always :P), testimonial is incomplete without this).. Hits/slaps her eye, hurts herself and then laughs at that act as she was actually supposed to scratch her eye :P While going for exam with book in hand, falls on the steps with nose touching the ground first! She dint realize at that moment she was supposed to secure herself before the book! Went and asked in a spectacles shop ‘Do you repair wrist watches?’ :D (I agree some optics shops may have watches, but then they are usually displayed!) She plans to have a dreamhouse with all fascinating facilities (no stairs, you swing and go to your hanging bed.. etc) and will live there with a horse, parrot and may be a dog. A wanna be IAS officer, but cannot stand her friends arguing (loudly, for fun) for 5 minutes… These are very few of the entertaining stories from an unending list that I have… I leave the rest to find out for yourself when you meet her (or probably you know them :P) Apart from this, she is a very creative, artistic person.. will go to any extent to help others… adds only well known ppl on FB (having met once or twice doesn’t count as knowing)… really hard-working (and workaholic too).. never leaves anything incomplete... will never stop even when very sleepy and tired  (slaps herself to be awake :D).. very dedicated to whatever she does.. don’t be surprised if she doesn’t reply back on chat or phone, she has a huge time lag there :P That’s ruju! Will miss you… Keep entertaining us with your stories :P

<p>My first year in bits and i meet this girl (or rather a character) called rujuta...i have never seen a girl like her before...what can i say...there is so much to talk about her...she loves going on camps, is a big anime fan, eats chilly flakes when she is hungry(!!) , ties her room keys around her neck(and also bumps her head while trying to open her door :P), wears a suit for her farewell...thinks she is brave(she is really scared of darkness) comes up with crazy ideas (like going from goa to mumbai on a horse!! or dying her hair electric blue(not only her but all her friends!!) or going for the prom dressed as a guy with french beard and orange hair so that nobody suspects her :P), hates taking pictures, takes time to understand jokes and hates it when people say that she is cute...and of course she is a huge fan of pirates and literally worships Sherlock Holmes and gets really really offended when i say that he is not real.She is mostly in  her own world. But she is a really smart, creative, focused and does what she likes with complete dedication. Her innocence is what makes her soooo adorable. Can't believe that this i my last semester with her in this campus:(...i know that she'll make a fantastic IAS officer!!....all the best ruju!!! hope we keep in touch... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-dighe">Priyanka Dighe</a></p>
<p>The first time I talked to Rujuta was I think while playing foosball in the gym (DoPY control room for spree). Dint know her much then, but later on as I came to know her better, I realized that she is 1 of d most unique girls around. The biggest Sherlock Holmes fan, values her special Sherlock carved ring more than anything else. The way she talks sometimes, I feel as if I'm having a nice time with a small extremely enthusiastic kid :D She likes to act like a strong, fearless boy even though she is scared of ghosts and darkness :P I have no idea from where she gets all the scary dreams at night. She does get lost in her own fantasy world many times and its real fun to see her completely confused looking here n there giving blank expressions when she comes back to this world :D and who can forget the way she suddenly hits her own head when she realizes she did a stupid mistake in something. She hates her pics being taken or being called weak or even a girl :P And most of all she hates being told she cant do something, may be she tells herself 'Challenge Accepted' in such situations :P. 1 of the things I like about her is that she doesn't mind being irritated as long as I don't cross any limits. Well she also likes to dance but is too shy to dance infront of people she knows. She likes reading novels and is a very fast reader. Also a great poet. Her creative ideas can make the smallest things look grand. I should mention Matt Damon, the only non fictional character she 'loves' I think :P In general, she is very helpful person, fun to be around, always motivates you and keeps you entertained. All the best for living your dream of being an IAS officer and staying in your dream house on top of a hill above a village, with your horse :P Just stay the way you are and stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranav-vaidya">Pranav Vaidya</a></p>
<p>Ruju!! Well, she’s one helluva girl! I haven’t seen anyone like her, and I don’t think  I shall ever meet anyone so special in her own way, ever ever again!
She might strike you as a quiet little girl at first sight, but don’t be mistaken by her calm looks, she is a fun dynamite waiting to go boom! Rujuta is always fun to hang around with..I love the way she says ‘Huh?’ :D
There are so many things and experiences and moments that I have shared with her, which thinking retrospectively I cannot imagine myself doing so with anyone whatsoever. Like joining DOS for instance. Rujuta wanted to handle guns. Hence we joined DOS. We wore great t-shirts then we left DOS :P
Rujuta wanted to play cricket, so we joined the Cricket Committee in our first year! Fun it was! Rujuta wanted to build a car, so we joined the Automobile Club! We slogged in the workshop, but I still had a blast with her. We both were the only ones interested who by choice gave our names for the baseball workshop in our first year! I cannot think of anyone else that I could have done all these wacky things with! Rujuta is a really adventurous girl and always game for such wild energetic activities! She stands by what she believes (rshjbjp!!!!) she does what she wants, and she is happy at the end of the day. We still curse her for those machchar photos! :P and then she surprises us by getting herself inducted into DoPY-of all the departments possible! But she has done a great job as the Creative Head for DoPY !
Dear Ruju, Stay just the way you are and never change! Good luck for everything in life! Keep Smiling!
Cheers, =)
P.S: I am SHER-LOCKED

<p>Rujuta - the first thing you'll notice about her is her long baggy tshirts 2-3 times bigger for her and shoes( no idea why everyone seems to neglect it :P)  The marathi dudette :P. She is very serious about studies. Takes so much tension about small small things. Good learner.....and hard worker. Also a library keeda :P She is in DOS.I dunno how they induct ,shez one of the smallest n innocent girls..... she is talented,funny ..really good at heart. Also a member of Dopy. Oh yeah one of the few girls who love cricket and actually have played it...........................................
Small advice from me ..dont worry much you'll be really great in whatever you underake. And i would surely buy you a small top and a sandal once i get placed :P
Best Luck !!!!

<p>Ruju! My dear, crazy, Sherlock Holmes loving friend! When I met her in first year, she was going on about Mech E and building some kind of gun mechanism, and I thought, Wow, here's a person who knows what she's doing, and what she's here for, right from the start. She's very sincere and dedicated, skips meals back-to-back to work, and writes motivational quotes on the walls of her room that the next occupant might find helpful too :P The fun we had on all our trips together, and the jokes we cracked, the birthdays we celebrated, their secret planning and execution - those were all the best times of my college life! Stay the same, and I know you'll achieve great heights in whatever you choose to do. Just promise me you'll stay in touch, always!!

<p>Ruju is so naïve and lost all the time. I still remember how she would get novels to Phy2 class and we would sit on the last bench and do tp, and how she wouldn’t get her specs and would try to figure out what was being taught :D A huge fan of Sherlock Holmes, I really enjoyed it when she would go on and on about him and then we would all take her case… Or how she refused to wear a sari and came to farewell with a blazer. Even after being irritated by people, she will never hold anything against anyone. A really imaginative person, she will have lots of crazy (sometimes infeasible :P) ideas.. She is highly adventurous and is always up for doing something exciting (Paintball was fun n congrats again for being the last person standing :D). She is easily excited by the smallest of things and this is the best thing about her. Never change!!! It’s been great knowing you! I am sure you will do great in life! All the best!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>yo ruju... !!! Rujuta aka ruju aka "The girl who falls so many times... :P" "One with the baggy tshirts.. :P", A SHERLOCK Lover... Completely Sherlocked.. More than Irene Adler... :D. I think that all these phrases aptly describe what rujuta is all about.. :D.. You see her and the first thing that will come to your mind is her absentmindedness.... She just is in her own dream world... Walking to the mess she might be thinking as walking to Hogwarts... Who knows.. No one knows what her world is like... She hits here and there while walking.. to poles, trees, even the pillars... Or may just fall off the stairs while she walks... :P :D So much into herself that she takes a few minutes.. (really minutes not just exaggerating) to get what u are talking... Its like even the simplest of question you ask her is answered by her after 4-5 mins or so.. From this we can surely conclude that the world that she day dreams in ... is a bit slow behind the clock (HALU as it is said in marathi... :D)... A total bibliophile... Loves all kinds of books, novels, etc... A very very very addicted to movies person... Watches all kinds of movies.. mostly has a craze about those fantasy lands and stuff in movies.. Pirates of the carribean, Harry potter, Transformers, LOTR... All such stuff...  A very cute girl she is to hang out with... She has her own style of talking ..kiddish completely... At all times...  its like your younger sister who is 10-12 year old talking to you or pleading you for some candy or something... :D (please de na.. pleeeeeeaaaaaseee.. :P) Very very innocent... Paramount innocence... :D You look at her and there she is with her sweet innocent face and her cute expressions... Laughs out really loud... even though she gets the jokes pretty late.. Tell her a joke on monday and then she will laugh on wednesday.. its just apt for her.. :D :P .. A total workaholic... Crazy about studies.. Crazy about machines... Crazy about cars and automotive stuff... She is so dedicated and a totally diligent worker that she will sleep for 1-2 hours if she is not done with her studying... Very very respectable dedication she has.. A born to be a mechanical engineer.. :D loves her subjects.. Ohh... and totally thinks that she is not a girl but a boy .. and that she can outdo any boys on earth in anything... Always compares herself to guys and not girls...Plays cricket very much better than the rest of the girls.. :) A huge cricket fan..  A very very Brave.. (ohh really ??? :D) person she calls herself... Remember that incident right( Ohh.. how can you forget.. ??? )Anyways you still haven't given us the iced tea that we had a bet on.. :P A totally fun-to-be-around person.. You will love her company the moment she starts telling you stories about her world... Ohh.. one more thing that I would like to mention is that .. This girl hates being pictured or photographed.. Given a choice, will hang you if at all you attempt to do such things... :D A very enthusiastic person who is always at the peak of her excitement in absolutely anything... (Rujuta patte khelayche??? and there she is.. Please na.. please na.. please.. and then you hear an infinite amount of pleases.. :D :P).. A person who is always happy which you can't really tell her from her expressions... Because they are never there... just a blank look.. but i haven't seen her frown.. :) A really caring person she is.. Very helpful.. will do whatever she can to help you.. A great thinker.. Quick at suggestions and solutions to problems... :) An awesome person to be friends with... Ohh.. just wait.. one more thing.. absolutely afraid of the dark and the lightnings and the rains... She just jumps off when there's a lightning.. or when the lights just go off.. she just screams even if there are people around her.. :D :P (another aspect of her calling herself brave.. :D :P)... Anyways.. Thank you for bumping into my life .. (Just like those pillars and those trees that you bump into).. You are really an awesome friend... Thanks for all those treats and patte and stuff... Also for the mangoes.. Thanks a lot.. Also please please be in touch.. its pretty hard to say a goodbye to you.. You will be missed.... I wish I would have had some more time with you on campus.. :( Have a happy life ahead.. May you succeed in whatever you want.. May God bless you.. Good luck for the future.. :) Its really hard to stop.. I can go on and on... But somewhere it has to be done.. :( .. Anyways.. Thanks once again for everything you are and giving me the friendship to cherish for my lifetime.. :)
