<p>Satti, as we call him, is a very good friend of mine, captained my ah3pl team with the utmost dedication and right spirit. He is always smiling and is a very good dancer. Loves playing games and watching movies. I just love our fb group you created. The strike bowler and reliable batsmen for our galli cricket team. Its because of his very good bowling that we won the tournament in Spree2012. You also eased the pressure off me that day, by an awesome boundary in the third over. For the full first year i have known you just as a great dancer from our group. Hope we see you dance in audi. All the best for your future!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankeerth">Sankeerth</a></p>
