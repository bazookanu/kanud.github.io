<p>Punch Palaknama, Gymson, Body Builder, Mr.Android..............Susano. The movie/tv series lover, Coding keeda, and a "silent violent" fellow ! Kuch bhi karega for coding !! A unique fellow who doesnt open up to every one. Quick tempered and takes things lil seriously. There will be rarely a few pics in his lifetime that he will like(doesnt like one even if one hair is mis oriented :P) and a nice guy. 

My first n dearest pal on campus, we even came together from to campus. Registration also together and ended up as neighbors, time passed by and our bond got stronger and have been together in many things since 1st year. Dude, the extent to which u wer called to senior hostels in 1st year ! huff....i remember that ur room was mostly locked in 1st 2-3 months and wen asked wher u 'd been u always used to say "with seniors". man, u wer THE fav fellow for them :D. U were the only telugu fellow i spoke to for about a month, despite u saying that there are quiet a few ppl in hostel. Then it was on my b'day that u introduced me to the rest of our gang, lucky me i totally got saved ! :D ! else i would be dead ( b'day bums ). Then our journey to Mynapi, Calangut/baga, doodsagar.......we have mostly stood together when it comes to arguments which took place in group. And hey ur b'day rememb, u proudly said "I was born  one day after Gandhi Ji was, October "Thaaard" (3rd) :D :P" and the TASK (goda kurchi + pa...) i gave u :D. The conservative guy who s attached to his room. The fondness u have for ur hair ! OMG ! also about ur impression ( u were not e1 carrying a little box with pickle in it to the mess :O ) and fitness maintenance. I used to say u go to taekwondo and gym and  show ur pratapam on poor me and my door ! :( :P ! When i look back to the past, u have definitely improved and have gotten better, in ur attitude and socializing. E1 tough u used to do soo much time pass,  u kept trying things and never gave up on ur interests. hats off about that, never lost hopes, kept on doing and trying for new and various competitions/ programmes no matter what,  this was mainly referring to u in 3-2. But hey u gave a hand in the android app thing, i was really looking forward for a quality treat ! :P. U r one of a kind.....among few different ppl i came across till now. Its been a great and joyful ride. :) 

U ll be meeting a lot of ppl in times to come, interact, grow and develop......do watever u want, just dont forget me ! :P :)

<p>Sachin is "Power". He is very dedicated, friendly . He always has a smile on his face which he induces into other people also. He is the kind of person whom you would feel talking to,when you see him. Seriously this guy has immense power. Even the hits he give you casually can hurt you..so please don't mess with him...:P. .

<p>Sachin has always been a picture of silent determination. Whether it is in workshop, carefully working on every workpiece (including Foundry!) even when everyone else was wasting time, or the way he learnt Python, practicing throughout the vacation and coming back having mastered the language (and subsequently breezing through the DSA labs), his attitude is always admirable. In spite of seeming so serious he is a great friend and always a fun person to chat with, too! All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-nayak">Neha Nayak</a></p>
