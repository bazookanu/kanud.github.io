<h1 class="page-title">Sagar birla</h1><p>Sagar, my padosi, one of my bestest friends, he is just crazy after watching TV series. PJs come as one of most important passions in his life, He will make you cry (1 ke baad 1 jo pj maarta hai _/\_ ). He doesn’t take tensions in life, soft spoken, very wise, very clever in pulling legs, easy going; you have been very dear to me. He never pick up fights, calm and cool nature. We have traveled together many times. He makes lot of plans of going out with friends. I have seen him, going for bathe twice a day(:P). He is very fond of texting messages to everyone; he likes to be connected to his friends. His FB statuses are unimaginable. I’ll never forget a friend like you. He has his plans ready for his future and he will surely achieve his desired success. Best of luck for your bright future ahead. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-sharma">Akash Sharma</a></p>
<p>The first time I saw this guy, I was scared. His protruding eyes, weird hair and the “i-am-so-keenly-observing-u” face can have an extremely intimidating effect. A mild introvert by nature, he is a gem at heart. Extremely brainy (except at Physics :P ), God of Maths and CP,  he is a god gifted PJ cracker, par ob wo PJ’s nahi, “logical cheezein” hoti hain. He is that guy in a game, who knows exactly what everyone is up to, but will not say it. But when he talks, everyone just listens, either to his decisions “chal rahe hain!”, “ACHHAA” (:P _/\_) or to his PJ’s. Na Nahane mein to bhaisahab ne kitne records tode hain pata nahi, par saala fir bhi baas nahi maarta pata nahi kaise.. One of the strongest persons at heart, very rarely lets his emotions out, but when he does, you realise the amount of thought, passion and consideration he puts into all of his actions, and that day, your respect for the guy just scales up exponentially. The way he lives with diabetes, and has made those injections a part of his life, like it doesn’t exist at all, its just amazing. Oh and yea, janaab shayari bhi likhte hain, aur aisi likhte hain ki Javed Akhtar ek baar toh soch mein pad jaye. Rupye paiso mein bachpan se dilchaspi rahi hai, isliye har trip ki accounting bhi yahi karta hai. A nocturnal  person ever since I have known him, sleeps very few hours at night, then comes at 3 and asks for food! I can go on and on about you, par to vut a long story short, Yaar I respect you for what you are, and I will cherish the times we have spent together. Those roadtrips, story sessions, shayari,  padhai, pj’s, etc, all those moments have been really memorable. Cheers to our friendship and may you reach heights! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>

<p>First thing that comes to my mind when I think about sagar is “He is one of those small Packets in which nice things come in”. I met him on kota railway station while coming here for admission. At first he looked like a seedha saadha kind of guy but soon I realized that he is not someone he looks like  :P and we have a lot in common. Then after coming to campus we got room in the same awesome corridor and now you have become an indispensable part of treasure of memories of my college life. 
He is a pure brainiac. A perfect example of multitalented guy who never misses any episode of innumerous Tv series he watches even during compre. His looks may project intimidation, but once you’ve been given the chance to know the other side of him, you’ll see the little child in him; the type who loves to laugh and treasure all the wonderful moments he’d been through. You’ll see the warrior who doesn’t give up a fight as long as he knows he’s right. You’ll see a man who knows how to love and give his heart to. You’ll see the music lover who appreciates good music. But one quality that I admire about him most is his ability to give honest opinions. He will tell u in your face if you are doing something wrong because its good for you.  As everyone in group knows he is fun loving and some extra adventure loving (all roadtrips, gokarna trip etc. were added an extra flavor of adventure by him :P)..Next to “Guru Amit” he is the one who always have a PJ in mind which can bomb at you and can term it as “ logical doubt” ( Isiliye pandit ne to iska bolna hi band krwa diya hai :P). Janab shayari bhi likhte hain and woh bhi deep wali bas inspiration de de koi..seriously most of them are legendary.
All those hours of chatting with you about life, about any random topic in this world , all those stories, secrets  shared , all your bhilwara kaands(all of them are /\), your ghar ke snacks, your opinions, all of them will be missed badly and deeply.
You have a special place in my heart , you are the one whom I respect and look upto for that accurate advise that I can blindly follow. I wish u hadn’t opted for PS in sem-II but koi nhi we will still share the same bonding. I know you will prosper in everything you do in your  life and will rock it. Cheers to all the times  :-)

<p>Cut to 4 yrs back. Kota, Bansal Classes. A short guy sitting next to me in the chemistry class commented on the teacher. When I looked at him, I was taken aback a little. I took him for an over smart, not so sincere guy who was there just to pass his time. But how wrong I was. Extremely dedicated towards whatever you do. Be it balancing your academics with following the shows you like or even watching the ‘worst of 2009’, you do it with style. Shayari ki taraf jo aapka interest hai, vo bahut hi behetareen aur umda hai aur use humesha continue karna. The one you came up with at the Utorda beach that evening was simple _/\_. A crazy insomniac (has always been a ‘nishachar praani’ at heart), I don’t know how you managed to attend all those classes after sleeping at 5. All the roadtrips, outings that were organized by you and approved by our dear own ‘kulta’ have been amazing.  PJs maarne mein aapne maharath haasil kari hai (only second to your guru ‘Amit’), one has to be on guard for your ‘logical doubts’ :P :D My twitter buddy, your tweets always makes me salute your creativity. Its an art to be funny when you are allowed to use only 140 characters. I have always admired your way of handling things and my respect for you only grew as I got to know you better. I wish you hadn’t opted for PS2 in the first sem but you got to do what you got to do :) Sagar, we go way back before #BITS happened to us and I am sure this epic journey would continue after #BITS as well. I already know you will achieve everything you want in your life and your facebook status updates would tell me all about it :P :D Cheers to the good times we had and to the times we will :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-tak">Varun Tak</a></p>
