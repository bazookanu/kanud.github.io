<h1 class="page-title">Sagar Chitre</h1><p>When he was first introduced everyone mistook him for a Delhite  but then pata chala chayla ye to apne Pune ka hai. :D.His eyes ( O.o ) are frightening :P but the enthusiasm in them is just inspiring.A hard working intelligent student Sagar is capable at succeeding in whatever he decides to pursue (though sometimes he is lazy :P). He is an avid Rafa fan.He loves watching tennis and also football where he shifts camps every year.He is a big time foodie and has a voracious appetite.He will always be like Peter Pan - the boy who wouldn't grow up.We still have a year together in bits which i am sure is going to be as memorable as the past three.All the best :)  Keep smiling. :)

<p>Sagar Chitre is vichitre in so many ways, its amazing. One of the most lively, enthusiastic and bubbly person I've met in campus. Our friendship began with the first day of college and grew ever since. Yes he does ask too many questions, but I guess that's a pretty good quality. Never stop asking questions Sagar ( Just dont ask me :P ). Sagar is also one of the biggest foodies I've come across. He's got a great passion for good food and at some point wanted to become a chef, which in my opinion, he would've been pretty good at. Few of the most cherished moments with Sagar would be when we just talked endlessly in front of his room with topics ranging from...well, girls mostly, but also life in general, the future, about how screwed we are academically and yes, his unforgettably pathetic jokes. 
It'll take quite some time for me to get used to not having you around any more. Thanks for the amazing 3 years, and I hope our paths cross soon again in the future. All the best for your journey ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>O.o O.o(BIG EYES) : Gtalk has never been the same after this guy joined my friend list. Sagar is a chilled out and fun guy ( upto a certain limit :P) , and someone who is extremely good at heart , although he kills his good qualities with all the lame jokes ( :P ). I got to know him well only about 2 semesters back and since then he has become a very good friend. He has practically spent his first year in BITS imagining himself with every girl on campus and asking us whether she will acccept his proposal :P . Now that he has grown a person, he keeps these thoughts to himself ;-) With sagar around you will never be bored. HE will always have some lame joke to cheer you up , and if that is'nt enough he tops it with some really weird stories. His spoken English as well as grammatical prowess can be compared to wren and martin . He is a huge food fan , and his stomach has probably evolved to imbibe some bovine features , because he just DOES not stop eating. The black hole that INDIA TV claims has been created by the LHC is probably lodged in this guy's stomach. He is a very emotional person and really cares about what others think of him, a bit too much at times , esp when he has had a pint too much. He is a through and through tennis(esp rafa) fan and a MANU(\m/) fan. With his newly developed reflex to anything going anywhere near his belly , he will always entertain you with his weird actions:P .  Jokes apart, Sagar is extremely good at heart and once you get to know him ,a really good friend to have. Buy a new bike dude!!!! I would like to end the way kulkya has - "Stop asking questions" . NEVER stop using Gtalk.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sumant-milind-hanumante">Sumant Milind Hanumante</a></p>
<p>Sagar! I chanced across this pseudo Delhi-ite in our first Maths-1 class. Found out he was in my branch, and that just sealed it. I later found out that he was from Pune, and my eyes almost popped out like his own (O_O). We had a great time playing TT in our very first semester (I lost... always). This lazy friend of mine is capable of doing anything if he sets his mind to it (that's a very big if :P). 
Sagar made my hell a bit better in the third year. He is the guy with whom I decide to bunk lectures, with whom I insult professors, and curse the world in general :D. His insane jokes always prompt a "maar khaychay ka" response from me. Oh, and as Sumant said, Gtalk has never been the same once I added him. I daresay he would have kicked ass had he been in MSc Economics, this is the guy I played Wall Street revolution with. Sagar is the one person who knows how to make money. Sagar is one hell of a foodie too. The "Black Hole" who can eat, eat and still be hungry. 
Well mate, you made maths CDCs bearable. Thanks for being such an awesome friend! Good Luck to you, and we'll obviously keep in touch :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>Most of the things have already been said. Dilli look. Check. Maths. Check. Foodie. Check. Gtalk. Not on my list. Double check. Sagar is the ever curious friend, with his innocence and childish air. Sagar is a tennis fan, football fan, the guy who looks as if he's been through a was after he's had a shave :D. Sagar is a person you can never be angry with. I ve tried a lot, I just didnt succeed. Sagar seems to have unlimited cash reserves. He is a very frank person, and will speak out, even if it means something bad for him. He asks everyone for opinion- be it buying a pen or a submarine.Thank you, Sagar, for being such a nice friend!! All the best! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>

<p>Sagar !! Where to start. A first impression. A pure Delhite. With a cold heart. Rich spoilt brat. And arrogant. He always used to look at me and call me 'Kundi. (Kannada people will know why its embarassing). I really dont know when and how I started to kinda get entertained by this dude. I mean first its GTalk. Its hilarious with this guy on your chat list. Then is the mobile SMSes. Stupid and weird ones. And of course his daily intrusions into my room, to irritate and annoy me. All works. All just strengthen this friendship. Interacting with Sagar has always left me cheerful and laughing at the end. I mean his chick related questions, questions on pataofying girls, on studies, on movies, questions, questions, questions, His childlike nature alloyed with his innonence, Sagar has almost become a 'younger' brother like figure to me. How can I forgot those texts I sent to you during PS, the awesome times we had in NC.The long hostel chats and discussions. Johns' and Joets' outings. These times have been one of the most memorable for me. Just remain the way you are. A hypocrite, but an innocent one, with a sense of wacky humour. Yes, there have been times when I just shooed you out of my room, or on the chat, or on the mobile. But Secretly I always was happy to have a friend like you, and actually kind of happy with your timely botherations !! You are one of the few people I want to be in touch with, for the rest of my life. I am sure our friendship shouldnt end with the BITS Chapter. May be we could have our own 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' version. Ill pray to God that you get your 'Katrina Kaif' atleast then. Else, you will keep pestering me throughout the journey 'Hot mulgi milat nahi. Hot mulgi milat nahi'. ................................*Cold Shivers*. May be we will find you a girlfriend BEFORE we go to Spain. That will be better.

<p>???????????????. That's an usual conversation with Sagar. The questions,ohh the questions. The curiosity is strong with this one.Sagar is one immortal cat! And after he is done with the questions, start the most epic pj's you will ever hear in your entire life. One of the funniest(pj only) guys you will find here, Sagar can lighten up anyone's mood in seconds. And it's impossible to get angry with this guy. No matter how hard you try, he will crack a lame joke or make monkey faces or just widen his eyes.His EYES. O-O. But no matter how much he annoys or irritates me, I totally enjoy his company. Sagar is a huge foodie (NC, shahi, bogmalo, shahi, IC, NC, bogmalo are his typical weeknights). He is also a big Tennis fan. He plays it really well(Vamos Sagar!). Also loves Football and supports,I think, Man Utd or Barcelona or Real Madrid or West Ham or Torres.I'm not sure. But he absolutely loves it! And then there are the girls. Sagar has had more crushes than the rest of us all combined together! It was really fun(and sometimes stupid)giving him advice on girls with Alok and Akshay.(not that we knew any better). Every peice of advice was followed by a million questions. Sagar, as hard as it is to say this, don't ever change the way you are. Your attitude, your childlike curiosity, your questions, your branded t-shirts. Keep annoying and irritating us for the rest of our lives! And don't worry, you will get the perfect girl. Cheers!!
P.S. clean your room.or don't. let the juniors suffer. Sagar : "But won't tripathy check my room? Will I have to sign anything before leaving? will the cleaning lady help me? will sumant ever grow facial hair? can I use them as a broom? will...." >.<<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
