Sagar aka shaggy, my best hangout buddy,.. the most fun spirited guy of all my friends and perhaps, the coolest of them all.. If my birthplace is my first home, and my room, the second, then Sagar's room is indeed the third and the coolest of them all.. all those moments we spent on his i-pod, or eating his home-made eatables or playing that stupid "bluff" game will remain imprinted in my memories forever.... Sagar is an excellent learner, a true sportsperson , a cunning mastermind (thats for you to understand sandy! :P) and a caring friend.He totally brings out the kid inside me.. Any game, be it cs, fifa, shank or any random shit, if he puts his hands on them, he nails it! So many memories are  preserved in his room..like the times in first year, when we all used to gather and discuss about the virtues and the flaws in each other, to the invention of a stupid magic trick which "they " find really cool ,in the third year,from  the crazzy balloon fight , to  the spy-filming of sandy doing crazy stuff in his sleep... and so many more that i've forgotten the count of.. his room's air is drenched with priceless memories... which define my college life the way it is now.. From the motivating talks when i felt "depressed", to the crazy stuff we did out of fun, from the awesomm outings we've had...to the racist jokes which some "tribals"  felt bad about... aaaaaaaaaaah... ITS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY..... and I really want to thank you for enriching my college life with all this.. Hope we remain such good buddies hamesha hamesha... and you continue to mesmerize others with your enchanting spirit .. hope you achieve what you strive for! cheers! :) mala aahe .. kala lala.... :P :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>
<p>"Aaj Jaana hai :P" at 5:30pm daily he would ask me to come for badminton. Sagar is as calm as ocean, he never loses his patience and is really understanding. He is one of the most helpful people on the campus and cares a lot about his friends and understands the value of friendship. He is a pro CS player too. He is a funny and can get along with anyone guy. I would remember those badminton matches which we played as a team and kicked the as*** of our opponents. It's been good to know you, thanx for being such a friend!!!. His dedication is sure to take him places. All the best man!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p>Sagar aka sagpandu is an awesome guy to hang out with..... everyone enjoys his company so much that if people in his corridor are not at their  rooms, chances are you 

will find them  in this guy's room  :) .... he is also a very talented guy, be it CS, badminton or T.T he will definitely impress you to say the least ..... a gaming 

freak, he must have played every game available on DC... his other interests include novels, movies, magic tricks, photography, travelling etc  ....Hell, every time i 

go to his room he seems to have picked up some new hobby... most importantly Sagar is probably the most descent, straightforward, soft spoken, sincere preson you will 

ever come across..... im sure he will achieve great things in life owing to his determination, dedication and passion.Have a great life ahead buddy ... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gokul-v--shetty">Gokul V  Shetty</a></p>
<p>I hate to give you this now, because you’re such an ass. But honestly, wats the point? So here goes:
Sagara-chan…my sweetest, truest, cutest friend. What is it about your room that everybody wants to be in it and somebody always is? Considering it a farewell note, writing this testimonial for you is so difficult it downright hurts.  These three years, if anyone has ever come close to understanding me, it’s you. You remain the one person who has consciously tried to figure me out and succeeded a little. You can’t deny that we share an innate, common understanding of things. I clearly remember the times when we both were thinking the same things, said the same things at the same time and those late-night talks in which we discussed just about everything. How we both like reading, & wanna be rich and famous :P And how we irritate each other with our “chuddy-buddy” talks. I see your calm exterior, but I know, inside, you are capable of deep feelings. You really are sweet sometimes. Probably why I’ve shared some of my secrets with you. Of course I’m an admirer of your badminton skills and I’ve seen you start from scratch and become one of the pro-est cs players on campus. Respect! You are soft-spoken and cool, insightful, determined and intelligent. Of the few people I like to call friends, you are one of the best. With your talents and potential, I’m sure you’ll be a great man in life. Yes, I’ve been difficult on you enough times. Yes, I’ve thrown enough tantrums in front of you. But kind of in return, you have my full and honest friendship, and so I’d like you to know that no matter what, I’m here for you always!! In hopes of a lifelong of friendship and money $$ :P                                                                                                                  P.S. : You keep pointing out my “chuddy-buddy” to me. Idiot, it’s you!

<p>"Sagar".is a name I call out the most of the time during the day...be it after watching an awesome movie, to discuss about it, or something new and interesting(not studies) that I learnt or whatever that has a way of getting discussed..He's a single stop to all of them.I bet he gets irritated by all that most of the time..But there's no way I can help it..Even if there was any, I wouldn't care to..He never shows that he's angry though.. He's a guy who perhaps's never shown his anger to anyone: a true GENTLEMAN(& a DECEIVER too :X). He's that guy who gives an irritating "NO" first, to every possible YES/NO question which demands something out of him; but the funny part is -->rarely does he not do the "thing" after that. His room is one of the most visited rooms(other than my own) for me or any other living person in my corridor(I call it the common room, hence). He's a true GAMER who plays almost every game that he can get and gets "PRO" in a very short period of time. He plays badminton too...and .. in a pro way like all the things he does....Though he doesn't show off at all, he's got some "MECHANICAL" talent too which is shown only when it's required off him. His theories on philosophy are secrets many don't know about..He's the balanced guy who can balance everything alright without any worries in life and that's why I don't have to wish..He'll surely have a bright future ahead..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saswat-baruah">Saswat Baruah</a></p>
<p>Lot to say.Great friend.Awesome personality.Enjoyed all these years being a neighbor to him.
You can learn a lot from him.OKAY. I am not good at all this expressing and writing stuff. So I am gonna shoot whatever stuff comes to mind. The great moments I will never forget.For almost one to two years the only great friend i had, when i came in here, and still is the BEST.I had got to learn a lot from him these year. One of the funniest guy i ever met.I will remember all the long arguments we had all night.I don't know how manages to be good at so many things at the same time... Photoshop.. badminton... studies... all time movie..books..I will always remember those long debates we had over stupid things. He has that unique perspective towards life and world,which very few people have.He always cheered me up with his jokes.He is that friend whom i want to be a friend with all my life.....oh.. and... "wassuuppp Man!! whatcha doin!!"... the way we call each other... MAN.. vl never forget it...
