<h1 class="page-title">sahil deshpande</h1><p>A cool, calm, resourceful, easy-going guy. I met Sahil in 1-1's Physics 1 class (Taxi's Class!) He would breeze through the Physics problems, hence the name 'Sahilov' .His use of the terms "Maakdya" and "Ratalya" was hilarious.With him as my bench-mate at Phy-1, I never had a boring moment, cos we constantly had some sort of discussion going on. His also shares my love for the 'Ice-Man', Kimi Raikonnen. He is also an expert programmer-Tejas,Sahil, and Datye making a deadly combination! Great to have a friend like you, Sahilov....All the Best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Sahil is one of those first friends on campus I had made with Shrenik, Yeola, Toxi and Tanmay.
<br>
Aaah ! Sahil wont go out unless its important and wont do a thing unless its needed. But he does roam with Datye near lib or bdome ( read dates).
<br> A good cricket player who has given some awesome memories ( remember that draw in HPL ? ) and does follows sports genuinely.
<br>Speaking of academics, I do remember his phodufying some Chemistry course and being on the bottom of the course but then days arent the same with his CS CDC where from what I hear he is a master at it. Managing CS CDCs and a COP under Biju speaks a lot about his dedication and still he manages those common room match sessions regularly.
<br>And yeah he is one of those people on campus who eat slower than me ( This makes me proud ). 
Happily flaunts his Google Nexus phone ( imported ! ) but doesn't blabber about it like Sathe does. 

Stay that same dedicated guy you are, would love to see you work one day for Google ! 
Go Bogmalo and get drunk atleast once !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Sahil,what a fun guy! I first met Sahil in Chem-1 class(just before the Datye incident) in the 1st sem. He has a very calm,composed,no bs air about him. Sahil is an excellent FIFA and NFS player(not The Run, yet). He is an even better programmer. The only person I know who can understand the Linux source and can write codes like it too :P. We work on the same wavelength, we have an understanding that is very rare to find, and also we both LOVE orange candies!!
I'm really glad to have met you,Sahil. Keep up the good work!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>a very decent and humble guy. phhodu in all CS CDCs and a dear of Biju sir! (the reason of my envy :D ) though i got know him much later but his simplicity, sense of humor and humility are enough to bewitch anyone and everyone. really cheerful and helpful and warm hearted. 
wish him all the luck for his future. (though we all are pretty sure of his bright future! )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>A fellow Punekar and a chilled out guy, Sahil is someone you see in my corridor when AAOC courses are on our heads :P A cool CS guy who knows what he is doing even though he might seem calm and confused :P I wish him all the best for his future. Enjoy and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Sahil and me are related way more than BITSGians! V are DGians too :P (But back den we dint knew dis!) He is one of the very first people i met on campus. Right from d first year when i was on the ground floor, v hv been gaming partners! The game changed (credits to Pranky) bt our friendship remained the same. I never understood the concept of gyroscope in d phy-1, he is the one who used to teach me. I remember right at the beginning, he used to maximum take time to eat food, but after all these years his speed has improved tremendously. :P  He is a big fan of candies. Sahil, thanks alot for installing all those games for me, making me a FIFA and F1 fan..i hope your room becomes more electronic and all the best for future endeavours!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shrenik-khot">Shrenik Khot</a></p>
<p>Sahil is one coll headed happy go lucky guy! His dedication towards CS is showing in his grades and I am very happy about that! I When you meet him you will feel this aura of laziness. Beware of his slow eating habits, dinner with him takes the longest especially for a fast eater like. But this guy is one of my treasured friends on campus. The days we spent playing Fifa10 were awesome, he used find some new move everyday and surprise us with it. He is also one of the most humble persons I have ever met. Few people will believe he is from a Marathi medium school. He likes to live a very simple life, and goes by the motto of simple living high thinking ( though his Nexus, Laptop and iPod complicate things for him :P ). He also has one of most analytical brains, the way he used to solve Physics problem proves it. Mugging up things was never his ball game, but if he understood a concept then few people remember it better than him I am sure that this guy is one day going to make it big!! Ultimately I am happy that we are friends and hope to be so for lifetime!!! 
All the Best Sahil!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>

<p>Sahil who became Pande because of his surname Deshpande. His mother is a psychologist and she read his mind at the age of 2 years and came to know that this person is going to be Google CEO some day. So his mother forced his elder brother to go to USA (he tells everyone that his brother is doing job in Google but actually he is just running the company till his younger brother takes the command.) A pro coder with very high IQ ( dont ask me how much because if I start typing the number here then I will have spend my entire remaining life typing it). He taught me CONSYS on a condition that I will teach him OPRE. You can see how professional he is even at this age.I loved playing AOE and Business with you. Sathe ke saath deal karne mein to bahut maja ata tha. Mess buddy. He eats very very slowly. I have read a paper which says that eating speed is inversely proportional to thinking speed. Sahil's case proves the theorem. 
So people start buying as many shares of Google as you can because their share prize is going to touch the sky.(you know why)
-that's all folks except the IQ thing... :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Chaheel! It started with playing Most Wanted in my room, and went on to being partners in wasting 2 hours of our lives every week in the MT1 Physics labs! Not once did we do an experiment properly, yet not once did we fail to complete one before time. An entire semester of labs spent laughing and fooling around, cracking jokes and never working seriously. Follow that up with insane amounts of random time pass. A CS enthusiast and a great coder, with a definitely bright future! Intelligent, humble, innocent and one of my few great friends on campus! We've had loads of fun times together and I hope we continue to do so for a long, long time! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
