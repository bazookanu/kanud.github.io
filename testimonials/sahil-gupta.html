<p>He's the guy you goto when you want a movie suggestion.
Any genre, any timeline.
He thinks a lot and ends up in a lot of trouble!
But then, these are the things which we learn from.
Doggy, as we popularly call him from his fetish for a obscene thing :P
Always had a bad shot at girls :P
You can go on with long lasting discussions with him ranging from IITs/Engg./Movies/Music etc. 
Sometimes this zeal comes in him from within saying "Yeh toh karna hi hai" like during ZEPHYR or CEL or even Prom ;)
He's a nice guy and a pretty good friend !
Keep in Touch :)

<p>One of my first good friends on campus... used to play tennis with me in the first year (remember :P )...  has the weird habit of going to NC alone just for a glass of lime... was also in CEL with me, Ishan and Dadu for 1 years and had great time with him... have gained a lot of respect for him after his PS1 at Angul... it was great to have a friend like him who is always cool and ready to have a chat... i hope we remain in touch... wishing you the best in life!!!!
