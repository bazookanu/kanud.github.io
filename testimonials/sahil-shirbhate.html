<h1 class="page-title">Sahil Shirbhate</h1><p>Sahil is a person with many different qualities. He is a simple, polite person who is very punctual about time and follows a fixed timetable for everything and has strict rules about what to do and what not to. These qualities of his are something worth following. He is very conscious about his health and im sure he is one of the very few people who never eats in the night canteen. This was one side of Sahil, the other side is an entirely different person who is damn hilarious, whose jokes are crazy, whose ideas are crazy, an awesome friend who is always fun to be around with. Three years are not long enough to know a person like Sahil and I have great memories of all the fun time spend in these years. Stay as you are - always smiling and cracking funny jokes which are sometimes hard for others to understand :P... May you achieve whatever you wish for .. Best Wishes for future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>

<p>I've known you since what 9 or 10 years now? And well, you've changed A LOT! Back in school you were this very shy, introvert and a sort of a bookworm kid. Or at least that's what I thought. But you've turned out to be quite the opposite, and I'm really proud of that. 
You've always been good at what you do. Backstage must have been really difficult but you made it look so easy. Managing Waves backstage is the toughest but you did it so effortlessly. I'll always remember our conversations about stupid juniors who don't know what the fck they are doing. And the even more awesome ones about you know who (well there have been plenty of you know who's over these three years and I've enjoyed talking about, and even better, listening to you talk every one of them :D). 
You've been a great friend and I hope we continue to be so. I hope you achieve everything you set out for (even the bot, heh). Wish you the very best! Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neil-dhruva">Neil Dhruva</a></p>
