title: Sahil Trehan

<h1 class="page-title">Sahil Trehan</h1><p>Sahil is the one of the most inspiring people I have met at BITS and a very dear friend. He lives life on his own terms and really knows what it is to be happy and have fun. He's a proper intellectual, unlike the dozens of pretentious douche bags that we see these days. His room is always filled with books on almost every subject and having a conversation with him can teach you a great deal about a number of things. He's very friendly, very social, seems to know a million people - it's impossible not to like him. When he wants something, he works really hard for it. He's one of the few people who seeks education and not a mere degree. I would very very surprised if he doesn't grow up to be a famous and well respected exponent of whatever field he chooses to work in. All the best, Sahil.

<p>Sahil is a dear friend of mine,we share the most cherishable moments in bits.Whether it is leaving the campus at 9:30 in the night or a mumbai trip just like that, or may be joining the gym fervidly .knowledge is his passion , a voracious reader who loves his kindle,and inspired me for to read a lot.A traveler always ready to go out and had explores every corner of goa and now every man in hotel priti knows us.The king of good times sahil trehan is one who always plays pranks with me saying "ahujja to itna phodu kyu hain", but the real thing he is a phodu whether it is understanding the concepts of chemical engineering or writing his amazing poems.A genuine banda who makes friends very easily , we have done tons of stuff joking and fooling around in bits, sahil with his determination will achieve his every dream and has got everything to make it big.best wishes:-Ahujja!! by vishal ahuja <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-ahuja">vishal ahuja</a></p>
<p>Sahil Trehan is one of my closest confidantes on campus and to many more on campus. His effortless and jovial nonchalance gives him an uncanny leverage when it comes striking conversations - be it Tarun Tejpal's latest article or Jack Daniel's history. His sweeping statements and potshots at some of the caricatures on campus are downright hilarious, making him a 2nd degree celebrity. 

Despite his apparent spring-in-shoes, the gravity of his thoughts is a thing to be admired and emulated. Add to that, his unflinching commitment to the high aims he sets for himself and in turn, influences others.  I have no doubt Sahil will go on to do great things and spread million smiles, en route.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amrit-pal">Amrit Pal</a></p>
<p>Saw him first in one of the most awkward positions and thought "kaun hai ye chutiya ?" (amit verbalized it :P ). Next time he was sighted in lib with earphones and a thick book infront then its all fuzz universe. Sahil lets a hanfull little people into his circle. If u are not in his circle "aap ch*t**e ho". Took me lots of effort until he started accepting me. Once i was in(M really F***** fortunate) a whole world opened up infront of me with a immensity so huge that i was taken aback. His choice of music will silence you, his knowlegde will amaze u. And as u keep talking to him, and realize how diverse the topics of discussion can be with him, u sit back and let it come to u slowly. Books in his room are about to touch his roof :O :O . But this all didnt come at a go. He did his own meditation. A hard, soul wrenching meditation. One year of realizing oneself. Whts hidden in us !! We are all tempted at the sound of tht but never did it !! HE did it and hence has insights into a subject unheard of in commonality. Hence u don realize how it feels to be the best confidate of HIM. Just wonder how interesting our topics of dicussion are !! But its not always intellectual :P sometimes we do dicussion never heard of, in a whole new way ;) . Ya I feel like m his broda !! Cheers(also first time with him) !! It feels so great being with him that all these words are just pouring outa me through my hands(no effort, no thinking). Speaking about toil u can take him as the denominator and the fraction will be a valid "probability". I don wanna stop :'( . Man I **** You. All the best for your life. I know i will get the privilage of sitting in a "laal batti" . Will miss you like hell !!!!!!

<p>Sahil trehan aka “khalu” for me. I still remember our 1st year when ishqiya movie got released and that million dollar dialogue by arshad varsi “khalu tumhara ishq “ishq”, aur humara ishq sex”. That dialogue had given a name kahlu to trehan sahab. He is one of the best men I meet in my life and one of my best friends too. More than this he is my “guru” in many things and how he used to teach me after every Prob n stat class in bogmallo aka bogi for us. Lot of memories of our friendship is associated with this small beech “bogi”. My puking, chicken, Smoke and lots of talks and discussions He is person with ocean of knowledge and lot of dedication towards work. I really learned a lot from him which helps me in my life and will help too in future. I enjoyed my bits life a lot with all his sudden plans. For example his creative idea of having samosa’s in mt1 lab. :) He is man who was always with me in all my good and bad times and had encouraged me a lot.
Due to his zeal to serve the land where he born and bought up, I see him as the person who will surely do something great for India in civil services and ob he will serve me with my free stays in govt. guest houses (remember I am mr. goel).  He is man with clear picture of life in mind and khalu I have lot of respect for your poetry. He fucking bastard writes so well. ? You are my buddy in bits life. Without you this bits life might not be as it was. Khalu, will miss u a lot. (Be in touch always) This last line is only for formality.

<p>Everyone in BITS may be using the word LI8 but this guy lives it! This guy is spontaneous and entertains others with his great sense of humour.With his witty punchlines Sahil can be friends with you in no time.The real Punjabi,full of passion and loves to bring smiles on the faces of people around him.No matter how  tense the situation,he never gets daunted and finishes off in style.An ardent fan of punjabi songs,has a vast knowledge in that domain.His confidence in his efforts to turn things favourable will definitely help him achieve whatever he desires.I wish you my friend you really make something big in life !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>"Bhaiyaa namaste" the first thing Sahil utters when he meets me...and lemme tell you sahil u need not say bhaiyaa nor namaste.The first time i saw him,he was nervous,tensed and all confused about the timetable,intructors,books etc as time passed on he adapted well to the situation and i could see the pure punjabi attitude in him.He has seen both up and downs in these three years,he has seen it all..and remember sahil without the bitter,the sweet aint as sweet..my dear frnd It's the sour and the sweet,u know the sour,which allows u to appreciate the sweet.Innocent face guy,smarter brain inside,crystal clear heart and pretty straightforward.I will always remember mess sessions,consys discussions, random anda pav gossips and cherish them till the end of time.I regret that i have never been to "V" with you :( .Being a ur snr all i can say is that "every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around..life is a long race :)" hope we meet on some bright sunny day and relive these magical years.
All the best ..shine on u crazy diamond :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>Though we had some common classes in first year, I really got to know him in my second year, after we were assigned to the same group in MT2 lab. He is totally dedicated and sincere to acads and always had  never ending chain of questions throughout our MT lab. Saved us quite a few times during the viva sessions like that. :) Wish you All the Best Sahil! Have a wonderful life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>

<p>Got to know him through POM class. We were in the same group. The first POM meeting where all of us came without even having a look at the case study and there he was prepared with his slides!!!! A good orator and a social guy. Whatever he reads, he does it with a great level of understanding. He always starts the conversation with “ek doubt hai”. Most of the time I couldn’t answer it and I wonder how can anyone think so much. I hope you achieve great heights in future. The dedication you put in everything you do will pay off and I’m sure you will go places :). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
