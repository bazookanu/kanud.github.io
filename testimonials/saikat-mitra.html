<h1 class="page-title">Saikat Mitra</h1><p>one of the most genuine guys i met so far! extremely down to earth and simple with a keen interest in pretty much most of the stuff. such an amiable personality! loved spending time in his room :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>He was one of my first new friends when i came to the campus. And since then, there has never been looking back. Fun loving and enthusiastic by nature, he is pretty knowledgeable about anything that's around him. He loves sports, especially football and is a big fan of LOTR. Especially on these two common interests, he is the first person that I always talk to whenever there is something new on the blocks. Will miss talking about them with you. My best wishes for the future :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>I will remember Saikat as the only guy in my hostel in 1st year who used to call me by my mobile phone's model name i.e. LG cookie  :| and then shake his head (i still wonder y??). But later we came to know each other in MT1, and since then, he started calling me by my name :D :P. In fact, he is now one of the few guys who calls me by my first name rather than my surname :) It was really good to work with him in MT1 as he did most (or rather, all) of the work and then do all the record filling work as well.  A pro badminton and TT player, I also know him for publicizing the not-so-good Norton Anitvirus in the days when few people had laptops :P  :|  Saikat is also well known for introducing the now-very-famous event "burnout" in quark'11 in which he showed his proness and managerial skills, and also for his successful "consys coaching classes" during our 3-1.  A light hearted and fun guy to hangout with, Saikat  is also a very good fifa player(now AOE as well).  But its sad to say, he has now left "that" group of "6 pointers" of AH4 leaving me alone  :'(....may be due to..........ummmm.....say........yeah (yaad aa gaya!!).......guna effect!!   I've already started missing u........    :(   >.<   anywayzz.....Best of luck for ur future....kya pata......chemical ki placement hogi bhi ya nahi......!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>

<p>A cool guy with a fun attitude. Had some great trips together. Though I don't know much about him, found him to be a generally helpful guy with a nice smile always :)
All the Best. May you do what you want to do :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>Saikat Mitra - He should put a board outside his room reading "I AM CONSYS GOD." He knows his subjects well and with his aptitude and skills he is bound to reach greater heights. His humor is something of an asset and I will always cherish building that ship with him for BOB the BUILDER in Zephyr :) It sunk but anyways :P May you go to IISc and become Dr. Saikat Mitra one day. Enjoy and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Saikat was the 1st guy i befriended wen i came to campus. Still recall the early days wen he had a no. of pics of megan fox and we used to take turns watching them. He was nicknamed foxy after that though very few people know that. I remember a lot of times spent in saikat's room owing to the awesum wind and random video downloads by him. But most of all i will remember all our corridor guys assembling in saikat's room and discussing crap. Most of the time it wud be khandu jo bara ki le rha hota tha :) Chalo enuf. Good luck bro for ur future. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/snehil-srivastava">Snehil Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Saikat, my neighbour! I couldn't have asked for a more chilled out, good natured and friendly neighbour. Saikat is one of the nicest guys around, and he's always up for a chat on just about any topic. The number of times I've randomly walked into his room said, "kya kar raha hai?"
Saikat is a really humble and helpful guy, and he's helped me out with almost every course we had in common. He's naturally intelligent and was the EM of quite a few events at Quark. Here's wishing you a very successful future ahead, and it'd be awesome if we remained neighbours even in 4-2! if not, I'll miss having you as a neighbour :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
<p>Came to know him during burnout, although most of our conversations have been on gtalk . It never occurred that I was talking to you for the first time given the amount of random bakwaas we did :P
Very cheerful, chirpy , fun,  happy-go-lucky guy…it’s  always nice talking to you..(rem: “abhi ek ghante padh lete hain..next ping exact ek ghante baad” :P)…hope there will be more to it… keep rocking,  keep hopping and have loads and loads of fun.

<p>Very friendly, and loves taking people's case. Knows a lot about cars and stuff, he's one of the people who actually know the stuff they're studying. Always intered in knowing if Bob would like to...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Everytime I am sitting bored in my room, I hear an echo:-"Oye Bob" and insanity returns back to our corridor.Saikat-much more than a usual neighbour, cheerful.always ready to help no matter how random I knock on his door,for the silliest of things : a pendrive, a compass and what not??? I cant imagine being organised without him.As for fun,whether its the random epic pj sessions,talking and discussing football trivia, I will miss him a lot during my PS stay.Hopefully we get the same corridor for 4-2 and have the epicness continued<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>A cool pro baddy player. I have always enjoyed playing badminton  with him. Always happy. 
We always enjoy taking Snehil's case at the dinner table. He keeps on telling Appa and Bara's stories which is highly entertaining. Works a lot when the time comes.( quark  not exams... :P). There were more  students in his CONSYS class that they are in N. Manjarekar's class. 
Overall a cool guy with weird spectacles. :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
