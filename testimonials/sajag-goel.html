<h1 class="page-title">sajag goel</h1><p>Sajag Goel is a great person and an awesome friend. He is the kind of guy who would do anything for a friend. Famous as DoH, he is one of the star admins of DC. In a party full of people he would be the person with a large group listening to him as he entertains them with his entertaining humour. I wish him a great and successful future ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>

<p>The most hilarious guy!!! Man you are simply superb at lightening up everyone’s mood when they are around you. Well, I came to know Sajag during PS-I and trust me, my PS would have been really boring without this guy!!! He is always there to crack his li’l funny jokes on the PS-instructor, other office members of PS, and other PS friends(including himself :D..tat’s the best part ;P). 
Sajag is a total foodie, it has been just a week since he came to b’lore and this guy knows every place in b’lore(especially food outlets)..he knows what tastes better in which restaurant. Aawww!!!The KC Das, u remember tat??It was amazing we used to have loads of sweets and minimum 2 plates of luchi puri and then the amazing misti dahi(mouth-watering!!) and then come back to PS station and doze off :D. We all would have starved without your food knowledge. :D
Though he looks giant(:P), I feel, he is a kid at heart and total fun loving, we went on many trips during our PS-I…the wonderla, the best water park I’ve seen in my life…and I’ve gone with the best people. I can never forget your surprise cake on my b’day..thanks a lot for that :D. In the last 15 days we all missed u a lot!!!(he was ill); me and sukriti especially. There are many more funny moments which we spent together. Anyways it was great knowing you and I hope we’ll stay in touch :)…all the best for the bright future ahead :D
