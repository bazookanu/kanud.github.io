<h1 class="page-title">Saket Tripathy</h1><p>Saket or as we lovingly called u Saketi! (don't kill me for this!) Even though we met in our first year i truly got to know you in Bangalore and trust me Bangalore would have never been the same without you. The countless times we bunked PS, the countless times we hung around in MG road, the countless pubs/bars/clubs we hit and you managed to sneak in thanks to your Oriya skills and how every woman in the place would totally check you out! (just had to write that :P) i would miss each of them rather i still miss each of them(not the women, those memories!). I still remember that one time (i m sure u do too) when we went to Xtreme and then to Corner House without having any memory of it and somehow we managed to go back home, that day has been one of my fondest memories of not just Bangalore, but my college life. You have been extremely helpful, caring and a true friend. I loved the numerous gossiping/bitching sessions we had when i totally poured my heart out to u! :P You always make "hanging out" with you a lot of fun even if  the outing is a shopping session where we have totally dragged you! Its been awesome having you in my life poking fun at you, taking your case and doing all sorts of stupid things around you all of which you took so sportingly. I truly hope we get to spend another PS in Bangalore! Wishing you an awesome future with a lot of "high" memories! Love you! :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>A good friend and a fun guy... simple words to describe this person. Saket, one of my best friends and an awesome guy to spend time with. During our long and eventful friendship I really got to know him closely and I would say inside this small kid, there is a big heart.
Thanks man for making my college days so interesting. I really wish we were going for PS together. Will miss the fun trips and long hours in Vasco and Panjim with you. Goes without saying college will never be the same without you. I wish you lot of happiness and success in life. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>Has been a great experience as a neighbour, close enough. You have been a great friend and I have enjoyed the times we had together. Very good at academics and has the caliber to achieve great "heights" and successes. A fun guy to hang out with. There might just be an animal inside him. No, seriously man you are going to be missed. May you achieve everything that you aspire for. Best of luck!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p>Saket oye! My trolling buddy..among other things. :D He's one of the most unique guys I've ever come across. Along with that easy going and fun nature, he's one of those infuriating type that never studies and still aces his courses. His other qualities include awesome jazz hands, Travolta like dancing abilities, Fruit-ninja high score destroyer and ofcourse, the ladies! He charms his way from Filipinos to Swedes and how!!

   He's been standard company for quite a few classes from POM to CAS and its been so distracting! :P We've been constant companions on dance nights, Bogmalo nights and night-outs (I'm starting to wonder why they all have 'night' in them! :|). He's a total dood from Sambhalpur who's set to show us all how its done in the O-R-I-S-S-A! :P
This guy's a blast and he's sure to achieve his aim of 'partying all night long all the time'! 
Its been awesome knowing you and we've got another sem coming up next year. So cheers to that and keep it cool..as always :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivi-anand">Shivi Anand</a></p>
<p>I have known this guy since my first Boghmallo trip and after that I have lost the count of how many times we have met there.Dude we saw Dolphin's at Boghmallo on our first trip!! Yes people that's true! A person who is in love with fun.All he wants to do is party all night and trust me he can find just the right company to do that(I still remember Mambo's :P). He would always help you whenever you ask for it.It has been great knowing u.Keep the fun alive!! Looking forward to an amazing sem with you guys in Bengaluru! Ol the best dude!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>
