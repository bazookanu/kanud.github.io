<h1 class="page-title">Saksham Bhatla</h1><p>Saksham Bhatla. Well for most i just called him "Batla", a very poor association to 'batli 'on my behest. Ok moving on 'Batla' is a one of those fortune few in my branch ENI that is so truly in love with it. I feel ashamed and disgraced when I look at the time i have spent pursuing a degree that I will never gauge and understand. If I ever apply for related posts , please reject me tossing my resume in a bonfire cause I know nothing. Micro electronics and controllers is like Uno and Lego to this man. I hoped but in vain, that some of his Gyan would eventually rub off on me. Saksham Sorry to say I really do not understand what exactly you do but I endorse it all the same and have faith that  you will display extraordinary dedication and skill in your pursuits . Moving to a personal level  this guy is fun to hang out with and a true entertainer , you will be in splits for most of the part and be enamoured by his personality. 'Batla' have a great and awesome future and stay in touch at-least . Signing off - Sathe .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhananjay-deepak-sathe">Dhananjay Deepak Sathe</a></p>
<p>Saksham Bhatla. The guy with the most funny, creative & humorous sm's. The creativity of his ideas shines not only in his jokes but also in his passion (electronics). He's the guy full of extreme confidence & can do anything he wants. He's one guy proud to be in ENI with electronics & programming being his vocation. He's a very helpful person as well. Anyone will enjoy his company due to his jolly character. He's an AOM pro as well (particularly KOTH :P). Had fantastic years with him in BITS !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>He is probably the first guy I met in BITS, or i should say even before BITS. I remember making conversations about developing some project but i never turned up to him for the same. He has been involved in various Projects since then. SPARK panel cordi in 2012 n winner of SPAM event in 2011 proves he has a very good electronics mindset. One of the very few students in campus who actually understands electronics. A true Electronics Freak
Have a great future ahead, best of luck for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Bhatla,...sounds way cooler than saksham. Always known for his last minute preparations. He has perfected his ability to study only what is required and when it is absolutely necessary.(respect /\) He would write reports only at the last minute and still pull it off. He's come a long way from being just a random guy from EnI in the first sem looking to land a date for the prom :P. He's my inspiration for many of my failed a attempts to learn a bit of electronics. Always fun to hang out with. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>We know each other since our days in a coaching centre. But yeah we didn't talk much then as our groups were different. He always wanted to be a CS stud but he accepted what he got. And became one of the most dedicated students in his branch. We had worked together on an image processing robot in our first year that did not really work. From that point onwards he got a taste for microprocessors and hasn't left that. He has been one of my closest friends during my time in the campus. I'll always remember the times when I called him for NC and he would refuse and then as if forced by some other being inside him he'll accept to come. Plus his Conspiracy theories about everything and the times when he switched on viggy mode. Also. pink chaddis hanging from his windows have been quite notorious. All the best bhatla. May you write a 100 papers.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mayank-singh">Mayank Singh</a></p>
<p>Saksham...The guy I look up to just before the Exams....Gets me up to date with the syllabus of ENI(though sometimes he's more clueless than me) . Rarely attends classes but 'luckily' attends the class on the day of surprise test. Has a great sense of humor n known for his killer sm's .Even though we are in branch..i have seen him more times in monji than in classes.Fun to be with n I wish best of luck with ur future endeavors.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sriram-iyer">Sriram Iyer</a></p>
<p>I always noticed the fair and chubby kid from Navrachna that came to all the interschool quizzes and debates I also took part in.Little did I know then that he would go on to become one of my best friends here at BITS.I was surprised to find that same confident smart guy in my corridor my first day here.We shared some similar interests and tried to put together a bot in our first year,which was a frustrating as well as exciting experience.(IP is jinxed ;x)..We shared some great times in our PS1 as well..with him there,those days are ones I will always laugh about.Had great fun on DC too,where I had the privilege of giving him his famed title ;-D.Hes got a great and unique sense of humor,and is always fun company,be it at a PSoC lecture,or a GD in a conference room.My fellow electronics enthusiast,he has the zest to constantly try new stuff be it singlehandedly pulling off the best Spark Panel we have seen since many editions of Quark past,or be it trying out some new mashup of signal processing and neural networks.Had some fantastic times with him in the past few years..Hope the future has great stuff in store for him.All the best Saksham!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
<p>Bhatla bouy ! Possi is what I call him usually.  Microprocessors Pysoc and what not ... this guy is a genius in electronics. One of few people who have great interests in entrepreneurship and core electronics on campus. I just love the debates and discussions we have had of what topics I hardly remember now. 
A nerd geek who is street smart the perfect definition for bhatla bouy.
Marcus and he with Mankad and Bhaavan make the geek gang of our hostel, the most enlightened people on campus I have met.
Always ready for NC :P you just ask him and he is ready to walk to mess.  
I hope he works well in his field and be one of those rare innovators of the world. This guy has the potential but what he needs to get drunk and learn to work in drunken state :P   ( kidding).

I wish you luck for your bright future and make us proud :D with some achievements and not your kids.
PS. Remember to courier by gifts if that thing happens ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Yo ! Got to know this guy pretty late in BITS. 3-1 to be specific.His witty status messages do bring a smile. Had a great time during the Neural lectures we attended. I guess that is the only course we've been regular in. Partly due to the awesome prof and partly due to the convenient timing (4 pm ). He's been pretty active with technical activities being the Panel Coordi for Spark and also organising PSoc lectures. Good to know guys who are so interested. Pretty good at acads too. Cheers, take care and do stay in touch.Ciao<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>
<p>Saale Bhatla!!!!!(I gather from the above testimonials that u have to start by writing what u usually call the person).. so lets see..... everybody has already mentioned how nerdy, geeky, electronics and PSOC pro u are, u have the funniest status messages and how cool u are!!!!! ...U and I have been friends for over two years now and I am so so glad that I met u.... Our every discussion, every trip to nc and the discussions that followed about academics, career, sports,world economy,  campus its people and girls :P have been truly amazing. I have always loved how open minded you are and your enthusiasm towards your goals make me respect you.  For those of u reading this, Saksham Bhatla is one of those persons who can bring a smile on your face just by doing what they do, by the way they do---> Saksham has a guitar, which every Tom,Dick and Harry coming into his room pick up and start playing..... but what Bhatla does is..... connect its strings to his PSoc kit and "clap & sing" when the LEDs on the PCB glow when he moves the strings....now how can that not bring a smile on your face!!!! I am really thankful to BITS and destiny for I have met some truly amazing people and vowed to be lifelong friends with them.... I really hope u maintain this vow too Bhatla irrespective of whether I feature in your list of amazing people or not. May you succeed in every endeavour you make.... hoping to see a businecc card few years down the line that read                 "Saksham Bhatla          I'm CEO,bitch"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-srivastava">Siddharth Srivastava</a></p>

<p>Batla.... He is born learner possessed with rational thinking and in comparative ideas. I got to know him in late 1-2. We both share many common interests. The discussions we had on any topic never ended without our future career options. He is cool headed & rarely becomes angry. It was fun to work with him on projects we did together. He is one of the few guys in campus who knows PSoc very well. He did very good job as panel coordinator of "Electrify" panel in Quark 2012. The main reason we became very good friends is we have very similar life story after coming to BITS. I wish him all the best for his future endevours... Be in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Batla is married to electronics and everyone knows that! :D 
He is one guy who taught me a lot in electronics and coding from the time I expressed my interest and enthusiasm in electronics and robotics, way back in 1-2. I for one, knew virtually nothing about both when I came here and my crazy fidelity to the raw enthusiasm for learning something new made me think, that I knew just as much as him! He really kept his cool and put up with it, without rubbing the truth on my face and letting me learn all the while. I should say, he treated me like a brother when it came to that. Of course, we guys take digs at each other more on FB than we do when we meet. But since he knows how I think, I end up falling into the pit! :P
He has always been the most approachable one in AH4's geek trio (Mankad, Marcus and Bhatla). His room has always been a brainstorming center and I'm sure that we would've published quite a few papers by now if we'd worked sincerely on half the ideas we discussed in such detail! :P
It was a great pleasure participating and winning SPAM in Quark 2010 (whatever happened of the prize money). Neural networks wouldn't have been as much fun either, if not for those interesting discussions! Looking forward to see the off-springs of your marriage to Electronics!
Good luck!
P.S. He is the triangle God! I am taking classes under him this summer to learn how to play it! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>

<p>Bhatla...What raaaa... I have never met a guy who can disconnect so much from
all the unnecessary worldly problems, yet discuss them in explicit detail.
All his arguements, be it describing the origin of the universe or the possibility 
of a cockroach leg in his lunch is backed up by complete and descriptive analysis.
We have had wonderful time together, he talking about his work and me looking at 
him like he is some alien species with all the sophisticated technology to destroy
the world in a moment. Really that's all I can make of it. That apart,
he is a wonderful person. I don't believe he ever got angry at me, even though what I did to him, would normally hit someone so hard that they would have surely murdered me. Remember Farewell? :D
We enjoyed a lot of beautiful moments, singing songs out aloud all around the campus at night,making random people uncomfortable from even walking on the road, and ofcourse the fun at Mongi.His jokes actually sound like he is explaining some out of the world concept, but in the end this style along with the intelligent humour in them, have a tremendous effect.
His distinctive inclination toward individuality, ability to maintain composure in all 
tough situations, and an inherent love for life have always inspired me.
Our discussions have given me something new every time and I have learnt so much 
from him on a philosophical level. I will always cherish the memory of this
wonderful human being... For all that you have done for me.... Bhatla, I love you.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritesh-gudge">Pritesh Gudge</a></p>
<p>Saksham Bhatla or Sexum.... or Quack-Quack..... or The Man with the "Glowing" Face :P ;). He is a man with many names.. a man with many talents. In my views, the perfect all rounder. He's nerdy wen it comes to tech stuff, he enjoys sports... nice taste when it comes to music ...Plays guitar as well... loves to have fun...What more can someone POSSIBLY ASK FOR!!!!!! he'll be always there to pump u up when ur down and will give u the best support u can think of .... " chal saale ki m*!@*H%R** c%#$#(^f$ ke aate hai... dekh lenge usko bhi" and with things like this, with saksham around u'll feel nothing is impossible. If u come up with any random topic crappy or nice , he'll always have sumthing to chip in which highlights the vast diversity of the things that interest him.Go to his room and he'll have atleast a 100 tabs open all the time... I seriously admire him for his willingness to learn about new things. The thing that i personally find most funny about being with him is that he always backs ( or at least tries to :P) his comments and statements with Facts and Statistics which lead to hilarious situations. Sometimes he comes out as a bit arrogant kinda prsn but trust me on that, it is is purely because of innocence, there isnt even a tiny bit of malice in his intentions. Hmm and about his negative side... it Doesn't EXIST. He is always ready to go on full throttle and teach u stuff and impart u whatever knowledge he has related to anything. I think he is the kinda prsn my parents wud wish me to be, proper "aadarsh baccha" types. I have had many many good moments with him , shit loads of fun.. awesum dinner times in mess, mongi chit chat sessions... bogmalo trips... his craving to get wet whenever we went to a beach :P... and all the times he used to pick the weirdest thing from the menu card and order it coz he luvs to try out new things. And this time the awesum new year that we celebrated and srsly man-- godlike driving _/\_. I still remember the time before our PS1 allotments, all of us wished to have u in our PS , that highlights how much fun it is to have him around. I believe he is the perfect ranchhoddas types guy, meant to be an engineer and apply the tech stuff appropriately ranging from the smallest of daily life things to space rockets coz he understands everything so well. I can feel he'll be doing something really big and Unconventional ... kuchh HATTKE. My best wishes with him regarding that. Next semester will never be as good as the past few years, you will always be missed by people. I hope we'll stay in touch for a long long time. Best of luck for your future endeavors :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhiraj-tomar">Abhiraj Tomar</a></p>

Writing about this guy...a really difficult task....there are not enough words that can define you, talents of this guy. Sakcy...a total ishtud.....King of all trades..... let it be the technical electronics stuff or playing a guitar or a basketball match......he might be the most talented guy I have ever met.....an all-rounder. An extremely hard working guy who is always keen to learn... lover of knowledge, a patient listener and a mastermind. This guy is a perfectionist.....whenever you go to his room he’ll be involved in something or the other.......be it a PSoC editor or just searching random things on internet (there are always atleast 100 tabs open also he'll kill u if closed a single tab)......this guy is unaware of anything remotely close to wastage of time.....belongs to the category of people who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn with passion all the time......holding on to their strengths, achieving each of their dreams and enchanting everyone they meet in their path. With his glowing smile, friendly attitude and happy go lucky nature...it doesn’t take him more than a few seconds to win any heart.....yet his USP remains....the true and pure heart.....which could do anything for his friends....you just tell him your problem and he would do anything to solve it.....there are very few like him who treat your problems as one of their own. I would never forget he was ready to kill someone because of my fight with that guy. Sensible, great sense of humor, love for nature, godlike dedication, incredible intelligence, astonishing creativity and a bit emotional.....yes these qualities together lie in this awesome brother of mine. I would always remember the crazy times we had together....the late night conversations....topics ranging from existence of God to Toilets of Indian railways(I still don’t know from where do you find all those stats to back your points).....from Political issues and your luv for Mamtaji ( :P) to job interviews. Thanks for making this a wonderful journey with all the countless awesome moments.....idiotic dance performances in your room, full volume bedardi raja, crazy videos, heart throbbing DJ nights, senti Bogmalo trips, swimming learning sessions for me in sea, trekking to Doodh Sagar, coolest New year at Bagha, road trip to Aarambol, your boring comments and weird conclusions on your most loved topic (:P)......and many more that together made my college life. You are an achiever and I know you will make all your dreams come true. Thanks for being there for me. These moments of our Friendship are never gonna die….a toast to one hell of a journey and to whatever lies ahead.

<p>Bhatla boy! Thats what I call him! A multi talented person, Saksham is a polite, fun loving and an interesting person to say the very least. Many times Ive just knocked on his door and sat down to have totally random and meaningless conversations with him (which i very much enjoyed). He is a simple guy and always has something interesting ,funny or gross :P to share. True to his name, he has a lot of potential to achieve what ever he desires in life. All the best for your future.
