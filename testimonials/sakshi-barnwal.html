title: Sakshi Barnwal

<h1 class="page-title">Sakshi Barnwal</h1><p>As her nick suggests, she is the alarm clock of the corridor as she is one of the first few people to wake up (although lately battery might have gone a little low :P). She is very reliable, wholeheartedly generous and helpful. She bonds with a lot of people easily, she is the life of our corridor and it is indeed true that without her corridor becomes quiet. She manages to talk a lot without annoying a bit. One quality which I particularly like is she is cleanliness conscious. :P.
Our rapport started building up further when we started going for "jogging" in the morning which mostly turns out to be more of walking and talking :P. I'll always you Sakshi and cherish these morning walks with you. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-yegnamurthy">Neha Yegnamurthy</a></p>
<p>Sakshi.. the most dependable, one of the closest and most understanding friend… You fully justify the proverb ‘A friend in need is a friend indeed’.. One of the most creative bandi of my corridor, Sakshi is rarely quiet and I really wish you never get a chance to be so. You are not only the apple of your Dad’s eyes but also a life to our group and our corridor. To explore her creativity go to her room n you will start believing everything I say.  Sakshi, the best part in you is that you always grow up with a positivity. Your faith in yourself and in life inspires me a lot.. and also your selflessness. The smile of yours which gets you hundreds of friends is one of your biggest assets. I still remember how u brought the thermocol sheet for me all the way in 1-1  _/\_ . Infact I was way too surprised to see that. And how problems of any domain and any range and any magnitude and any complexity ( way too much of complex algebra :P ) would have a solution when brought to you. I cannot imagine that I have very few days with this miracle lady… Time literally flew.. but you know , though I may not be around to make u smile by my stupid statements (like paar cable (courtesy : Mahadev Gawas)) and also with my mimicry skills (I had completely forgotton about them since 3-1 :P ) so please refresh your memory with them and smile.. Memories are meant to be cherished.. not to be missed .  May you get the best in your life and may God grant you all your wishes . Stay in touch. ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shweta-suman">Shweta Suman</a></p>
<p>I don't know Sakshi well enough to write a long testimonial but she is a great friend of a friend. I know she cares a lot for her friends and I wish her all the best for her future. Keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>My most lovable friend, Sakshi is extremely sweet, enormously talented and exceedingly emotional. One can rely on her for anything right from books, food to moral support and she will try her best not to leave you disappointed.  One of the few people who can do anything to help you in your bad times… she will give all sorts of medicines she has when you are ill, she will cheer you up when you are home sick, and she will scold you badly when you are doing something wrong (:P)….she is the type of friend everyone desires to have..
Editor of melange, member of dopy, abhigyaan and urja…she manages everything very well.  Very artistic, she is always painting or doing some artwork at her leisure time. My walking and talking alarm clock, she is the only person responsible for my 8.00 am class attendance.. Cleanliness freak, I still wonder how she keeps her room so clean all the time…always excited to go out, she definitely is fun loving person.
At the end i just want to quote what Rachel and Monica (from F.R.I.E.N.D.S.) said to each other when Rachel moved out of Monica's apartment, "I mean its the end of an era!!!!"  Love you forever... All the best for your future…

<p>It's been almost 2 yrs since we became friends.Its been a long journey...from acquaintances to friends to very good friends.She is my motivation to attend all those boring lectures in which I do nothing apart from making doodles. Motivation because I look forward to her questions and arguments with the proff(remember DYSOC :P ). All those EEEP labs, projects, assignments wouldn't have been so much of fun without you. She solves my doubt when I am in dilemma whether to sit on the last bench or on the second last bench :P. All these things are surely gonna be missed. Sakshi as a person and as a friend can be seen to those ideal people who can help anyone and everyone without even thinking twice. Her tensed face can't go unnoticed. Actually her facial expression itself can remind you about the days left in any of the exams to start. Jokes apart, she is really a nice person to hangout with,voices her opinion without any fear ( way too much i think ... refer that mess kand :P), write notes very sincerely in class and then shares them with me :P, sweetest heart on campus, doesn't like watching movies instead she loves talking and talking and some more talking, she loves coding, loves her laptop(which is way too girlish :P) but she loves her friends even more. I wish that you achieve all the success which you rightly deserve. Have fun and enjoy life to the fullest

<p>Sweet Sakshi! She is the most caring, selfless and outgoing person I have ever known! A true friend, every time someone has a problem she will always be there to help you out. When things seemed down, she has been my source of hope. She has been working in Abhigyaan for so long now and is extremely dedicated to teaching Chikoo. She also has a creative streak and makes all sorts of pretty things in her free time. Thanks for everything. I hope you achieve all your dreams. Wish you all the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>She was my first friend when I came to the college...Rarely have I come across such sharp brain..

A really hard-working person with 'never give up' spirit...her blood group well comprehends her attitude...Being +ve is all she knows..A faadu company! She wont let you get bored ever with her endless talks!! You know something is wrong when she is silent..Her co-curricular don't speak that bad..Abhigyaan, DoPy, DoCW, Quark DEM,Melange...madam, I didnt realize you were that awesome...Creative to the core!! She can draw, she can paint & she can make!!..thanks for my EEEP & workshop reports :D She is enthusiastic about her goals & passionate about life ...Daddy's girl!

<p>The most selfless person I have met in my life. Very hardworking, sensitive, understanding and down to Earth person.  She is also the perfect one and our Alarm Clock!!!  Never steps out of the hostel without her shower, prayer and her room cleaned. Will never waste a grain of food in her plate and always gave me her sweet (except ice-cream, her favourite).  Somebody who will give you a lecture if you miss your meal but will surely miss one of hers! During the exam nights, her door would be filled up of the “Wake me up on time” notes by the rest of the corridor people.   Ready to do simply anything for others, right from giving moral supports to huge favors. Somebody whom you can always depend upon. Always there to share your happiness or sorrow.  She is like the simplest solution to all our complicated problems . I remember our first year together.  How you used to wake me up in the morning (ob, you still do), teach me EG ,take me to the worsksop ( you know how good I am with directions :P) and help me with the reports. There is no track of all the gossips we have had in your room and the food we ate you got from home (we hardly left anything for you!). You are like an elder sister to me aware of all my likes and dislikes, correcting me and forgiving me whenever I was wrong. You have a heart of gold. You have supported me in many ways (the list is never ending) and I am sooo thankful you were there. I really do care for you (just can’t express it well at times) and hope you get all the great times in life. It feels great to have a friend and neighbour like you ( in fact it was like sharing 2 rooms together with you)! Love you loadsss SAXI!! Take care ? …..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>
<p>Sakshi was one of the first people I met at BITS and from Day 1 I had known her as a very CARING and HELPFUL person.... She has a soft heart.. She loves evry1.... I have often seen her taking special care of sick or hurt animals... She is someone who works very hard in evrything  she does..... One good quality about her is her acknowledging others achievements whole heartily..... anything good happens to you and Sakshi will be the 1st one to congratulate you... She knows how to respect elders... May God bless her with the best of futures !  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>

<p>Saaxxiieee.......wat to say about this blabber mouth :D ! when u r with her, the term "boring" will be erased from ur dictionary and she s a TYPICAL "IS" !! I will never forget the THEORY about on/off of  the first street lamp near nescafe _/\_ ! She is one of a kind. One of the most CARING, SWEET, ADORABLE, MORALISTIC, HILARIOUS, TUBELIGHT i have ever met. :) She might be a blabber mouth, but she knows wat to blabber and what not to, she is the best company in case u need some to talk to, she does know how to keep a secret and make u feel comfortable.  

We met for the 1st time in lib, we have grown into such good friends, simply wonderful. It was mainly coz of THAT(R....) thing, we actually started speaking. Then, mutual teaching classes in lib ! U taught me chem and i taught u physics ! :D ! It was great, but still i ended up getting an "E" in that course, complete waste of ur efforts :P and i think u got a D in phy ! Time i spent with u was great wonderful and comforting, we had fun, studied together, told each other things when we needed some one to talk to, those meetings at Ice n Spice, evening strolls, teasing each other, it was all great and a memorable. And hey, rakshabandhan, how can i not mention that, u were the one tying every single rakhi i get by post :D and of course one by u as well, u 've been like a caring sis, those rahkis r all with me and i will try my best not to loose them :P . U have been among the dearest friends i have had till now, and i will really really really miss u. I cant believe that i am writing a testimonial, it all seems like we met just yesterday ! :(  
And Oyee....touch me rehna.....nahi toh thuje dhoondke.........i dont know wat to say ! :P

<p>Sakshi one of the oldest frnd of mine in IS......i always use to pronounce her name incorrectly(n still continue to).she is alltogether a different girl as compared to other bitsian girls.I found her to be very homely,family valued,concerned and a caring girl.she is immensely hardworking...ever ready to help any IS folk in ny subject(becoz she is good at all :P ).... n very much concerned to IS welfare.Many times misfortune struck her(i still remember how ur EEEP lab exam went wrong) but she never lost hope n proved herself with flying colors.....above all she is a true person by heart.....such people are rare to be found in todays world but may be we all kernalities were the few lucky ones to have such a person among us.......I wish all the very best fr ur future n i m sure u will do something really grt in life.....stay the way u are....God bless u......keep in touch !!!!!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kapil-aggarwal">Kapil Aggarwal</a></p>

Hmm .. sakshi ..!!  what can i say about this girl ..!!  An amazing person overall .. a girl who is dedicated towards what she wants to do ... and that is evident from her gpa graph since first sem .. Now i wont focus on acads coz thats not my area to focus on  :P ...I have known her more precisely since 2-1 when we had seperate classes for IS .. A very sweet girl who can laugh as effortlessly as anyone else..A "bihari"  girl , who is extremely proud of her culture and can defend it beautifully even if the person is a delhiite or a mumbaikar.. ( bechara raghav .. once did a mistake of disprespecting bihar politicians, & the rest dat follwed was an unnatural calamity on him)A girl who respects frndship and one you can count on in your bad times .. Also, a dedicated person who  cares about society and keeps it on her top priority list. Working with you in Abhigyaan was great fun And simply speaking , has a great smile ... one can bring happiness on the face of the person she is talking to .. A person who calls me cutie pie as she herself is one of the best in this department and has the ability to look at people with great sincerity and honesty.. A person on whom I can crack 
jokes on without being worried of how she wud react .. Was extremely happy for her when she " Destroyed a person's life "  :P in her second year and still goin strong ..!! haha.. bad one .. i know ..!! She will , for me, always remain one of the few frnz i met on campus whom I can never afford to dishearten . I wish the best ,one cud get in life,for her ...  keep smiling always and ... Bhulne ka to sawaalich ni uthta .. :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>
<p>I clearly remember the day we had first met. New into da colg not knowing ny1 n full of anxiety. At a time when i was in much fear of ragging I found a very supportive friend in her. I remember she had accompanied me to 1 senior's room 1 day(remember?!!) coz i was too scared to go alone. Then began our roller coaster ride of 1st sem. We experienced da 1st of erething together i guess...da excitement surrounding wearing new dresses at diwali... da tension for our 1st t1(thermo..remember :P) waves'09 n den celebrating the sudden jaundice holidays. Sakshi is 1 of da few people who would take you under her wings n make u fly in her own world. N u would really fly..trust me..coz her world is full of trust,care for frnz n finding joy in small things :). My most precious memory that I shall take along with me would be when she consoled me after my Eg mid sem. I still dunno how she could make out dat day dat I was low (coz I hardly ever show my feelings on my face). Might be a small thing to do.. but to me it meant a lot Sakshi. Your nature is very adaptive.. ur 1 of dose ppl who have da skill of adjusting anywher wid ny1. N that's sum really good quality to have. So just follow ur dreams..u shall achieve the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/niharika-tiwari-">Niharika Tiwari </a></p>
<p>Whoa! 2 mins back i was wondering how to start dis piece nd then i saw ur pic ..... Amazing pic ... ur luking sooooooo pretty :) ..... its ironic how I created my profile on melange far before u did nd am writin ur testi sooo late ..... may be because i want to wri8 it really well nd also because im not sure i'll be able to pen down all dat i feel for u or not .... but i'll give it a try for sure .... Sakshi or Sak (as we now  call her ) was my nly hope wen i decided to join BITS 2 yrs back .... Belonging from d same place as her I was expecting her to be at least nice to me if not super Friendly .... but i was completely unaware that soon me , yash and Sak wre to become d best f buddies in BITS .......

….. For many she is an awesome person, for others she is an intellegent being , talkative , bubbly , energetic , ever enthusiastic .... …for me she is all of those and an AMAZING FRIEND .... she is a friend in Need .... she understands me well , cares for me more than any normal friend wud and scolds me at times (:P) wen i get bad grades.
For her two things matter the most in the world :- Her Family and Her Friends 
Im glad I fall in one of the categories …. For me she falls in BOTH ? ?
It makes me really sad when I think f spendin one full year widout her in BITS ….. ? She is a friend , Philosper ,Guide …. She has all d qualities u want in a Friend 
A shopaholic like me ….. loves street shopping ….. I still LMAO wen I recall d day we went window shopping in Madgaon ,,,,,, Yash’s bday nd d Karaoke ,,,,, Go-Karting ,,,,,, I cud go on forever …..
Love U so Much ….. <3 
We r more than  Friends …… We r Sisters …… :*

<p>She has so many and such long testimonials, i'm afraid to write one. Nevertheless, Sakshi is the friend with the big, beautiful smile that could make your day. Always cheerful and always talkative, every time i've met her i've seen in her a happy, jovial, smiling person and a good friend. 
May you have a great life ahead. All the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
<p>Sinny!!. The alarm clock of our corridor needs no intoduction!.The reason being she knows almost every person on campus! She has infinite number of friends on and off campus! I remember the number of phone calls she would recieve per day back in first year and the places she used to reach unconsciously while talking on the phone :P. SHe manages to remember everyone's birthdays,thanks to her awesome memory! and makes sure she wishes everyone. I distinctly remember you got more than 68 phone calls on your birthday in first year! :O _/\_. She is most generous person I have known and does not hesitate sharing anything of hers(quality which i still have to learn).She is sensible, nurturing, caring and not to forget a pro-advisor! Her hardwok and her sincerity stand out. She is a dedicated member of abhigyan club.Hats off to you and your patience in dealing with people. We do share quite a few things in common. The best among them is the movie-hating part :D. We still have a semester together and i hope it would be full of memories, as sweet as you. I am really lucky to have a friend like you! You have taught me many things which I shall not forget! Keep rocking \m/.PS: I love calling you saxy :P :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
<p>The alarm clock  and  the essence of the corridor…A girl who knows wads happening in every nook and corner of BITS!!  walk past her room in the mid night all you  can see on her door is  3 4 sticky notes with “wake me up” on them … Sakshi .. the ideal girl!! .. Be it getting early in the mornings … washing clothes.. cleaning room everyday … the girl whu every mother would want to have ? … from one end of the corridor to the other .. ne1 who want any help … will go calling “sakshi .. “ and she will be right there with what you need. Though many would have said this … but I feel that she is the most generous, supportive, motivating, caring, down to earth and list goes on n on … These is no bound to how much she helps people … be it her closest friend or her acquaintance … she is ever ready to help. Her room always open for all people. A very creative person ..  whu can turn room slippers to wall hanging :P … She is also a very sincere person who puts in her heart and soul to what she does .. be it studying .. painting … etc . An extremely hard working person who if full of sanguinity and confidence. She is a very outgoing person who can hang out with any person.  I think she is one of the best daughters … an awsm  sisters .. and obviously an gr8  frnd .. whu values all these relationships a lot ?
I remember talking to you in the first few days itself … and in just a few days we became very gud friends  Those days where we played antakshari in her room was just amazing .. with soo many girls .. n all f dem signing lyk crazy …Late night gossiping … munching fud …  neva gona forget these . … She was one of those whom I could go to whenever depressed and have full hopes of coming out of her room with a smile with all the advice she would give.  She is one of the people I will surely miss the next year … All the very best for your future ..  Do keep in touch and remain the same ?

 Even though we have to move on, she will still make the effort to stay in touch with friends, which is such a nice quality in someone. I am truly grateful to have such a wonderful and caring person as Sakshi in my life.

<p>Shayad Suki na hota to baat hi na hoti ... Chamach pe force. U r right ek baar socha tha maine ;). I really regret not starting to talk earlier. Few minutes on gtalk(sakshi barnwal is never online). Dont remember how we became friends really good. But ussse "kaaa" farak padta hai!! Sometimes u feel nobody understands u and then u go to sakshi and realize wow man she understands. Being with her u feel very "comfortable". U can crack a joke any time, crack a joke on her and she will give u the sweetest possible smile(a very distinctive feature of her personality) :) . Do I need to speak about academics ?? Ok then, she has been the district TOPPER of 12th. :O :O . She is one of the best friend of one of my best friend. And ya tht dinner \m/ . Whn U will go out into the big challenging world i can assure u tht u will always find a hundred helping hands, with time hands=exp(t).

<p>Writing testimonial for this sweet, charming, kind hearted has been a really difficult job for me!!!! The way I met this girl is still a surprise for me…..It was in the corridor(from C-wing to C-mess)…she was gng wid her friends, listening to the song “piyu bole”..myself being a music lover, I went and just asked her if she can send me the song…It was that song which made us friends, the friend I Cherish the most, the friend whom everyone should have!!! She’s ‘the’ most friendly, pure at heart, hardworking, helpful, selfless, sincere, honest, dedicated, clean-freak ….(never ending list) person. The best quality about her is that she’s selfless, she really tries to help each and every person whoever needs help from her and expects ntng in return. She’s a really good “C” coder, but she rarely accepts it…the way she coded in CN  and DSA was amazing!!! She loves her family a lot!!. Actually she likes everyone, as in she never has any hatred towards anyone(of course an exception is there:CBK :D :D). Frankly speaking how much ever I write for you I still want to write more, but it’s sooo difficult to put all those amazing moments in words!!! The dominoes trip which you, me and suki went….I can never forget it!!! She’s my “Rakshabandhan” sister on the campus, always she used to make me get rid of that home-sickness on the day of Rakshabandhan (I know that I owe you many gifts for all those Rakhis :D :D)…Will be missing that next sem stupid!!! I’ll remember all those days you, me and noopur spent in classes and after class hours!! Thanks for always being there when I wanted to share happiness or when I felt low or when I just needed someone to talk to or whatever it myt be. I don’t really care abt whatever ppl think or whatever ppl might say …..you are the best person and you’ll be my friend forever.
The day you told me that your PS-II got shifted to 1st sem was a shock for me :( :( . It was very difficult for me to try to get it that these are the last few days I’m gonna spend wid u!!! You are the one person whom I’ll be missing the most after you leave for PS.
I just want to say something, You are the best person when u are cool and without any tensions. It’s ok to get tensed sometyms, but not always. Sakshi u’ll be my sweeeeetest and beeest friend ever..I’m never ever gonna leave u how much ever v fight and I irritate u!! I’ll always be there to listen to all your childhood “bihari” memories, talk to you about any random thing, listen to your happiest moments and also irritate you with my childish behaviour, vampire looks and my bad-hindi. May all your dreams and future plans come true!! I just hope and wish the best for you, always!!
