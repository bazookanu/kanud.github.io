<p>A person with great charm. She has a great smile and an aura of happiness about her. You can never get bored listening to her. A bit moody (sometimes it becomes difficult to gauge) and a very hard-working and dedicated girl once she sets up her mind on something. It was great working with her on the project and I will always remember the words “Akriti kuch kar lete hain naa kal sir se milna hai” and those last day report submissions. I had a memorable time with you. Wish you all the best for your life ahead and may you succeed in all your future endeavors. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
<p>The bag of requirements, Sakshi has every day to day thing you may need.  Very bubbly and fun to be with, she is frank and at times moody. She can often be found in the common room sitting in front of the television and has all the latest updates on almost all daily soaps :P..Rem, we started by exchanging songs via Bluetooth in maths1 class(lol :D) . I ll always cherish your “gharelu nuskhe” and some intimate talks we’ve had…. Will miss you a lot Sakshi..may you have all the success in life :D

<p>~~Mere saamne waali kamre me ek BIG VOLCANO rehthi hai~~~  My "Jeju darling" is like a volcano of emotions which can erupt anytime without warning.
And this volcano erupts pretty frequently too... at least 2-3 times a week. You have to be on Tsunami alert 24/7. I cannot comprehend how one person
can have so many mood swings... don't you get dizzy? But my Jeju volcano also calms down just as suddenly as she erupts.... (she's so fickle i tell you!!). :P
(Sorry Sakshi... i just couldn't resist talking about your moods :P Dont kill me!)  

Oh Holy God in heaven, i thank thee for giving me room 311... for i would have never known sakshi like i do now otherwise. 
Sakshi dear, I learned so many things from you... you taught me how to clean my room & wash clothes & you even taught me how to pack (remember how bad i was in 1st year)!!
Really... what would have become of me without you? You r like the nagging mom i never had (because I nag my mom usually)... THE PERFECT WIFE! Smart, pretty (super 
photogenic) & so efficient in everything (especially housework). Your are my personal notice board..always reminding me of important notices which i never read. Nobody 
can beat you at bargain shopping (i don't get it! How come they never reduce the price when i bargain but ALWAYS agree when you do??) You cannot keep anything to yourself
... always so frank & outspoken... so frank that sometimes people think you are rude.. but since i know you so well, i know you dont mean it that way :) You are always 
there to give us a good scolding & knock some sense into our peanut sized brains when needed. What are you... a YOGI? How can you be so sensible? And what befuddles me
even more is how you can be so sensible AND so ridiculous at the same time. You are sooooo stubborn sometimes!! Let me tell you... you are one CRANKY person! But i love 
you! I love every single CRACKNESS about you :D My JEJU Daarrrlingg!! :* :* :* MUUUUUAH!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/lasya-boddapati">Lasya Boddapati</a></p>
<p>Sakshi! She is bubbly,sweet and very hardworking..frank and a good person at heart... Chemical cdc classes were so much fun with her.Not to forget the numal classes together, which otherwise would have been boring....and the awesome trip we had to arambol will always be remembered!! I wish you all the best for future..hope that you achieve whatever you desire! Never loose that innocent smile !!? <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
<p>i have known u since my second day in bits...u were there when my parents had just left... n after that.. u were always there when i needed you. :) thanku sakshi... 4 ur care, love n warmth. At times i cant make out what u r thinking... n gussa bahut jaldi aata hai tujhe...lite liya kar !  But ur affection has always been really comforting.. n so has ur room :P  ill always remember ur 18th bday :) that ws the 1st bday we celebrated here..
the movie sessions, our first pataka shopping outing, the many more after that n ur dance moves :P ...all will stay afresh :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saumya-gupta">Saumya Gupta</a></p>
<p>She is one person in campus whose anger or even the possibility of getting angry and can scare me.:P Probably the only person who has scolded me so much in all these 3 years.Sakshi you are an elder sister that I never had.I know I take a lot of time to open up to people ...but you are one of those very few people who were successful in doing so.I may not have ever expressed this to you,but in those small things that you do for us (you probably don't ever realize it),I've always felt your love and your care.For that love I am happy to be shouted at for thousands of more times(dont take it seriously :P).If I would have been gone out for a long time I would get a msg "abhi tak nahi aayi?".If she doesn't know where I am she'll ask "where are you?". You made me appreciate friendship and friends.You've made me learn how to take care of people.how to be there for them when they need you,whether they say it out loud or not,how to understand them.
I remember you used to come and check on me every few hours when I was sick.You'd ask me if I wanted something to eat.You'd sit there and talk to me .I have had friends in the past but I guess I never learnt how to take everyone along with me and walk.
You pushed me to go to vasco all alone in that goforsaken bus of Goa to get my glasses repaired.I can never thank you enough for that.(though I was very angry that day).I never used to be as independent as I am right now ,and a lot of credit goes to all of you.
If I ever buy my own house u'd probably be the first person I'd call (don't worry I'll clean it up first),after all you are the best at organizing stuff. I know this is getting really long and I'd never be able to say everything so....I'd just say that I am really really lucky to have you as a part of my life.
P.S . You are very very moody :P HAHAHA <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/meghna-mehta">Meghna Mehta</a></p>
<p>Sexy Saxiiii :) So caring ,so wonderful and sooo adorable!!She will always scold me for my last minute attitude even when she knows i m nt even close to changing my ghatiya habit :P .She is the perfect daughter my mom always wanted :P Kuch bhi chahiye ho,d answer is sakshi :) solution to any problem :) And so determined when she sets up her mind on sumthing be it studies or jogging!! U are d one who made me start jogging but as usual i went back to my normal routine in a month :P At times i feel me nd u are so same but u r extremities of what i am :P Kitnaa sochti hai choti choti baaton ke leke :P kuch bolegi nhi bt it will keep on running in her mind nd den suddenly d volcanoo erupts out of no where :P chill madam :) She has always been dere for me,someone i can always go and talk to ,someone who will always keep her door open for me,someone i am so sure wont ever leave me at my bad times and someone who will always make me smile with her bubbly nature.The thing that amazes me about her is however bad her mood is ,it brightens up when she gets ready :) This explains y she loves shopping so muchh.i wont ever hav been able to get a single thing if it wasnt for you :) Dere are so many things i love abt u but d most important one is ur neck :P (i believe u got what i m referring to ) All of us have 1 common dream to attend sakhi's marriage :P remember i will get dhol waale fr ur marriage :) And i so badly hope it cums true :) !!

<p>Even though our meeting with each other in mess was quite weird and embarrassing (to me at least: P), I am really happy we became good friends…. Sakshi is one of the most caring person I’ve ever met…..she will be the first person to call n ask u in person how u are doing if you are ill….She is also amazing to talk to and will listen to you when u need an ear and will help u if u have any problems…..She is very smart, and also one of the most determined persons I ever met, nothing will stop her from doing something once she sets her mind onto…..She is also extremely clever and photogenic(ur pics come out the best of all :D )……..The last three years would have been soo different had it not been for u….i had soo much fun talking to you about random topics, be it PS or at mongi and I am going to miss it a lot…..I wish u all the very best for ur future and I know u will achieve all ur goals as nothing can stop you once u aim for something with that mind of urs :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/moheth-koppolu">Moheth Koppolu</a></p>
<p>Extremely caring (unobtrusively so at times ) ,very focused , happy , hyper in instances, hard working, responsible yet fun loving ....That is the Sakshi I have come to know :) and though not many would suspect at a glance, but Scaryyyy at times as well (and hence the non aggression pact ) :P Affectionate to all , you are always missed when not there :)  thank you for helping me out when i was in over my head and needed 'expert guidance' :D (guess if you've forgotten) :) You I know will succeed in life where ever you go :)
thank you for three years of unforgettable memories :) Tc :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nachiketa-dash">Nachiketa Dash</a></p>

<p>Sakshiii .. my dear , loud , singing neighbor  :D ... She is a wake up call for me at 7.30 AM .. ARUNIMAAAAAAAAAAAAA ... mEGHNAAAA . Laaasssyaaaaaa ..  . I'd not forget how clean she keeps her room ! She speaks totally practical.. Sometimes sound like mom .. Like a very elderly sister in her advises. She obviously knows more than me about "being a girl " . I love her for her caring attitude. Never could forget how much fun we had together .. few but very Long chitchats .. and I could simply barge into her room and strike a conversation with her. I see her as very practical determined and hardworking(CG _/\_)  -- you know what you do and what ur good at ! Many ppl dont realize it as a strength -- But seriously I'm sure wherever you go you will go heights and make people around you happy <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>organized, cleanliness freak (monica :P), hardworking, dedicated (though lazy at times), responsible, caring, food lover, its difficult to describe her in words... oh n bhai ladki mein jaan hai. panga mat lena.. bhaari padega :D scary at times but only if u test her patience.. which is not much but somehow she managed to jhelofy me :D on another note, she's complex.. its difficult to understand her (at least for me..) but they say that u can never understand women..
<br><br>
all in all, it was a memorable time spent with her and she will be missed :)
