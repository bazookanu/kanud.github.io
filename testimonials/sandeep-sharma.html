<p>One of my bestest buddies.. shared hours of griefs, moments of joy , tolerated his endless "bakwaas", which was a good time pass by the way, and not to forget his endless one sided love stories, and his never ending crush-list.. to sum it up, hes been one of my closest pals, whose devil may care attitude is inspiring in an funny kind of way, watever happens, Bawlo is li8! Hes one of the key ingredients in making what my college life actually isss... Parting feels like separating a separating an important part of my life from me,.. I wont find a buddy like you eva , im sure!!!
-Bawlo rocks ;) .. <hope its good trp :P>

<p>Sandeep is one of those irritating friends without whom your group remains incomplete. At first he will appear to be a sober person but after initial interaction you will get to know that he is no where close to being sober :P. Well we always were in the same group be it any project or assg and always I used to be the one working and he entertaining me with his stupid bakwaas. Whatever it be, all the projects and assgs looked like a cake walk because of his support. Be it EEEP car wiper project in which we actually went to a truck workshop to get that motor to CoA presentation.All those CoA labs will be missed when we actually used to talk and do nothing else. Ask him for any kind of favor and you are assured that you won't be disappointed. What you can call  "yaaron ka yaar"  hai. DC mainchat king _/\_. Bakwaas karni toh koi issey seekhe after all even that's an art. All this kept aside, he is a true friend. When you need him, he will be there. Helped me innumerable times, be it teaching me GAN n IntroSys an hour before examination when I had no clue about the portion coming in the examination or to irritate me ( becoz at times you just want that :P).Will make you smile (or actually laugh :P) when that's the last thing you want to do. Used to ping me on dot at 7:30 AM (for once he was punctual and regular and hence got the name ALARM CLOCK) during vaccs so as to update me about his crush life :P :P. All those outings wouldn't have been so much of fun without you. Bawlo hai toh kya gamm hai. All the best for your future and I am sure we are gonna be in touch. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>

<p>Sandeep Sharma aka Bawlo, the undisputed king of mainchat, a true Marwari, a fun loving, happy go lucky nature person. His jokes are sometimes soo pathetic that u feel like slapping him :P but you wont, instead you will surely laugh at them because of his way of telling them. He is a hardworking person who takes extra sheets in exams as if free ke laddu mil rahe hain :P... Cheers to all the masti we had during our SE project :D... Wish you all the very best for your future!! Rajasthanion ka naam roshan karna!! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>I first met him in Durga puja celebration. He was a very helpful senior to all of us, made us laugh on his silly ,but funny jokes... after that I'd though we would never meet again, but Sandeep doesnt let go his friends so easily... we met in waves again, and then our friendshiip increased..
He is very caring and sweet.. he loves his friends, to some people, he loves too much :P,
I always used to look up to himm for guidance.. thanks for being an incredible support and an awesom friend..
hope we clear all our misunderstandings and have a better future..

<p>Baawlo Chhoro.. seriously he is mad person, Rajasthani chhora, who has big dreams and is sure to accomplish them all..... great sense of humour, great at heart... with sparkling smile... get serious over stupid things, but is a great support whenever you are tensed, got to know him in 2-1, during IS classes... in beginning my opinions for him were not so good, but he proved me wrong. One thing very weird about him is he keeps on getting new crushes and then will pakaofy you alot... but next tym you will have a chat with him, his first line will be “mujhe nhi padna in chakkron me..”, n in next chat, he is again talking abt the same girl... phew... loves web-designing, graphs and photoshop, he is one person who really helped in my Computer Graphics assignments... He is _/\_ at designing and obviously at DC main chat... I can never forget those +2’s, tere ultimate comments and dheeraj ki udaana at the google group, and many other small small things which always made all of us smile... doing COA seminar with you was fun, all of us were very tensed... but it was you who was everytime saying something or the other, which lessened our tension.... One common dialogue what you kept on saying in 3-2 was “marks ke liye mat padh, sikhne ke liye padho.. “... be the way you are and teri sanju tujhe mil jayegi... ( :P).... take care...  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>What can i say about Bawlo.Didn't see crazy guy like him.It really takes guts to stick to one thing :P and i really wished if things would have been a bit different in 1st sem :P As he got DC chat bakwass award you can imagine his talk..not much different in corridor :DLeaving fun things aside bawlo is a hard worker.He actively participated in all IS activities and flooded our emails like chatrooms :P When power in gone and you heard a guy screeming u need not think it is bawlo :D Bawlo and i had a lot in common from workshop itself  :P and it was fun to be with him all these years.Will miss all that.have a gr8 life ahead bawlo..Hope you get what you seek :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>the most mischievous person i have seen on campus... loves to tease and irritate people... enjoys life to the full and is nice to be with (but for a short duration)... long duration stays with bawl can be harmful :P.. be the way you are and best of luck for the future!!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>Sandeep Sharma, I still remember the day when we had just met once or twice and you were very ill. While taking you to Med-C I was very afraid ki kahin tumhe SWINE FLU to nhi hai bec it was very contagious and I thought I might catch it. But u saved my life..:).....
Bawlo, a clean hearted person.
I have observed him a lot throughout these 3 years and can proudly say that Bawlo just has a very thin layer of a dhongi cloak over him. He makes fun of others, fights and does many other useless things from the top of this cloak. But underneath this cloak lies a wonderful person. This person ois fun loving.. jovial , caring and helpful in all situations. 
From starting till today all our days have been awesome and I will cherish them throughout my life. Your mood swings have always entertained us and will always do.
You have been a very patient listener and hope you will always be....Will miss all those days we hang around and ur MED-C visits and ur GF dramas........AApke bina mauj masti to hoti hi na......thnks for being a part of my college life ...you will always be a good friend....tc.
And all the best for ur future.....................<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>
<p>Sandeep...Hmm to be blatantly honest he is without  doubt the most irritating friend i have ever had... Yet he has been the one who has made me laugh the most... He sees everything in life as yet another opportunity to have fun... and makes the most of it... He thinks he has been created with a purpose in life... (Read... to find the girl made for him from a never ending prospective list of candidates.. ) He has the most infectious smile... and even when you are trying to hold back your urge to just murder him he can still make you smile... He thinks too much... however he thinks only  after messing up situations because before that he is too busy planning how to ... (one totally shaitani dimaag) ... He has his own rights and wrongs and though he himself is always ready to take the plunge... do what he wants... he gets scandalized by anybody else going against his "expected code of conduct"... He is an awesome dancer and really knows how to sway to music... He makes friends easily... ( and you will know you have been befriended once he starts off with his never ending saga of "Yaar woh aisa kyun krti hai" ) All in all we have had our set of troubles... our times of fun...and i may act like i cannot tolerate you... but beneath all that bluntness and me indifference is still a friend who will never forget you... All the best for you future...!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>Sandeep.....kahan se shuru kare.....Always the first one to comment on my pic on FB...now am kind of used to it...".maja nai aata if my pic has no comments from you".....he and his rules about friendship...don't ever say thnx to friends...dont say sorry to me....reply on gtalk on time..and what not...i always fail to keep up and he is always after my life for that...but its just fun to be around him..no worries...only jokes...and  smiles....and yaa he keeps pulling my leg for every second reason....will miss you soooooo much next sem..but you should be the first one to comment on every pic i upload on FB....and that is a rule....just be the way you are...and stay in touch. or else you know how can i blackmail you..:):):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/divya-gupta">divya gupta</a></p>
<p> I have rarely ever called you Sandy bcoz there are as many Sandy’s in this world as there are Sandeeps. I never have called you Bawlo. At most “The Baa-lo”. Reason being: You are my Sandeep – the extremely irritating (to others), nonsensical and crazy friend people only dream to have. Sandeep, for me, is one of the most caring and understanding people. We met before our college life in ‘Dehradun Kochivalli Express’ and have been the best of friends since. No matter how much we fight and how much we try not to talk to each other, we always end up where we began. He has stood by me when others were against me and has said and done those small little things that tell me that he cares.  He has a capacity to not hear others in a conversation and keep on going with his own tales, but, God, what tales! His constant heart-breaks are as funny as his stupid jokes. Perhaps funnier. But still, if ever I have to say one thing about him, it would be that he is a lovely friend and one I love.  Apart from this, I think he’ll be a great business man. I’ve seen him work on his physique with extreme devotion and would say the results are gorgeous!!  His constant complain: “Girlfriend nai hai yaar!” has been coming to me for three years now.  I, on the other hand, seriously have my doubts that he is married already!! :P Who knows, with Sandeep, you can never be truly sure. The only thing you can be sure about is his friendship and the fact that he’ll be there for you always, like he has been for me. Here’s to our friendship!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
<p>And the award goes to(aundience shouting'bawlo bawlo bawlo')...to Mr.Bawlo Choro aka Sandeep Sharma.Indeed most people know him as bawlo rather than sandeep because he is the chat king of the campus.An awesome fellow....one of my bestest friend.Always ready to help,very friendly and caring.He has good photoshop skills and is also a good dancer and is very creative.A typical bathroom singer;always sings very 'purane' hindi songs while walking in the corridor.Sandeep has a unique sense of humour, sometimes irritating but most of the times hillarious.I will always remember the times we had...bike ride......Trw,gan presentations..and much more.He is very dedicated in academics.I am sure he will achieve whatever he desires and becomes the richest(:P).All the best duddeeeee!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sagar-deshpande">sagar deshpande</a></p>
