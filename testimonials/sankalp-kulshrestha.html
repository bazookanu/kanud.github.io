<h1 class="page-title">Sankalp Kulshrestha</h1><p>Sankalp is one of the most kick ass people on campus and a very dear friend; the kind of person who'll always be around when you need him. He's very chilled out, has a great sense of humour and in my opinion, he's the undisputed king of the DC mainchat. :D TheW@rlord _/\_ He's enthusiastic about everything he does and it's always fun hanging out with him. He's extremely good at coding, has a passion for music and has produced one the best spells of bowling that I have seen in BITS. But the best thing about him is that he's very simple, honest and very trustworthy. Wish you all the best, Sankalp! Rock on \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>A very work oriented person... Prefers remaining focused all the time. But you just cannot ignore Sankalp when he is in Fun mode :D. Subtle but punching humor skills. Only person i have met on campus, who can cool down anybody's anger with his honey like speech. A very good writer and coder. Very Ambitious and definitely works hard for it. Great music taste :D (kyunki our music taste match a lot :P).
Will always cherish our first year mainchat moments - with changing nicks - spamming - having Ramleela on mainchat!!! Your nick is still my favourite one - The_W@rlord.
Will always remember you for all the fun we had together :)  best of luck \m/
May Happiness and contentment be with you every moment of your life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
<p>First met this guy in PS1 , saw him working his ass off day after day , and thought Ha , must be a arrogant 9p prick . Fortunately he was neither :P. Despite belonging to eco , quite a nice  guy. You can always talk to him if u are ever in need of bakwas jokes . Quite a programming pro and also a very good writer . And also quite a DC++ force to be reckoned with , being a warlord and all.
Hopefully, weâ€™ll have a sehr gut time next year in CS :)

<p>A decent guy known for his 'chudaap' on dc mainchat (The_W@rlord). A coding pro who wakes up at 4 in the morning and codes in java. An enthusiastic dancer with his pro dj nite steps. A decent cricket player (:P). A great debater who is confident of himself and knows what he is doing. He may get on your nerves at times. Nevertheless you will always enjoy his company. Best of luck for your life ahead and have a great one. Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rajat-koujalagi">Rajat Koujalagi</a></p>
<p>Sankalp Kulshrestha is an amazing person, and I consider myself lucky to know him!
He is very sincere about any work he takes at hand and completes it with utmost dedication. This simple and honest boy is a kind hearted soul who knows a plethora of programming languages.
He is always ready to help and share his knowledge. He wrote a software to run Simplex Codes in his free time! Geek and yet fun to hang out with. Amazing company and a gem of a person @ heart! 
Stay the same and never ever change!
Cheers,

<p>Okay..so i think i can safely call Sankalp a workaholic (his java projects and all), But, he won't ever bore you in a conversation. He's takative, so to say, and though i've never heard him speak publically, it's a fact that he's a great debater, what with all the certificate he got in EPS. And then of course he is the 'W@rlord" - never understood y he kept that nick, though. All in all, a wonderful person and a great friend. Wish u all the best in life, buddy!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
<p>Sankalp is the most enthusiastic person i know on campus!!... i haven't ever seen such energy and enthusiasm in any person...after all who takes up a random challenge in class to build software to run simplex algorithms...!! :P
thanks to CIMA, i got to know this wonderful person better...very talkative, cracks lame jokes :P , says whatever comes to his heart! he is a kid at heart... :) ... a very simple, honest, down-to-earth and helpful person with amazing ideas and excellent presentation skills... 
i will always remember the times we prepared for CIMA-those late night data collections and ppt designing near LT, the innumerable voice recordings u took for the video, the sundays you woke me up at 9 for a meeting, the infinite number of times u said ur part of speech (so much so that i remembered yours more than mine :P ;) ), the flight to mumbai and the random tympass at the airport...
be as awesome as you are.....forever! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruthi-srinivas">Shruthi Srinivas</a></p>
<p>Extremely hardworking guy, when not studying he is doing some CS programming. A geek with a touch of chudaap (read W@rlord) this guy is extremely amiable and endears himself to others. An ever dependable person, he was one of the few guys in my economics class I enjoyed being with. Excellent in presentations and speeches, this guy topped EPS!!
All in all, I am gonna miss this gem of a person!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>

<p>I would never forget the day Aditya introduced me to Sankalp. It was in 1st sem after T1, I guess. After that day, Sankalp from a friend to a good friend few months later is now my one of my best pal, today. Apart from being a good programmer (one of the very few programmers on campus, who always aims at shooting something different), is a genuine and a good person to the core. Wherever it may be, EPS class, DC, etc he always has a habit to mark his presence. Fun guy to hang out with, I still remember those nights after every damn! compre, when we used to roam all round the campus, man! those were seriously some! nights ;) . To add, a beautiful smile he has, which I wish would remain on his face forever and all the very best for a strong future ahead. :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>Sankalp is the guy who doesn't care what the rest of the world does and is happy in his own world! Had it not been for sankalp i dunno how i would have completed 5 macro economics chapters in 1 hour ;) Sankalp is very helpful and has a unique way of explaining things. No doubt  he is the Best Debater of the College!! You should look at the zeal and passion that comes out of him when he is debating. He comes up with unimaginable words and builds up any story in such an interesting way that it is sure to catch the listeners attention. He is very creative and his creativity is reflected in all the bollywood song to which he gives his own lyrics (for example "Mata Rachiteshwari" ;) :P)! He is really a pro coder and a very interesting person to be friends with. We missed you all for the farewell dude :-/ ....i wish him all the best for his future life...Kudos!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>He has all the qualities of a gr88 frnd...i wont mention themm....but somethings very special about him...give him any work and it will be done with perfection whatever the workload ,time constraint may be...i just slept near those mt labs during the cima preparation and it was this guy who wud not sleep for 3-4 nights just to finish the work...but i will always remember and hate his sleep in mumbai when he didnt accompany me and jaini to marine drive at 12 in the night....and yes..i think the biggest fan of mimicry ...he was one my biggest motivation for doing all that ....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-agrawal">Anubhav Agrawal</a></p>
<p>To all those ppl who wrote these nice things about him... let me tell u the truth...   This guy lives opp. to me... for the past three years i have been tortured by his singing dunno what he sings and from where he sings :D. but its been three years and now i kind off like his bad singing... it helps me get over my CDC's .. makes me realize there are worst thing in life. JOKES apart the guy is really hardworking.. pro coder.. great inspiration(except for singing)..highly motivating .. can't say more yaar.. plz stop singing..  :D
wish u have a great life ahead.. all the best..

<p>my brother from different mother :P. It was a pleasant surprise to have found someone having the same surname on campus (for us its a rare event :P). I still remember the first time you came and introduced yourself during drama inductions. We haven't had that much of interaction over the past years but you are someone who will always be there in my memories of this college. You are just an amazing guy, extremely talented, hard working, polite and down to earth as well. You ooze in confidence and are really the epitome of simplicity and manners. All the best mate for your future, there is no doubt you will have a very bright one. God Bless :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Sankalp, you're a great speaker and even better debater. I'm really impressed by your speeches in EPS. Well i dont know much about you so cant write a lot, but nevertheless good luck, have a great future ahead...!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>I first met you in a very strange situation i dont think you remember , it was during ECO freshers party in 2-1 you thought i was a junior :P then it was actually we talked to each other for the first tym during DYSOC becoz of ur attendance issues :P. Working with you was always fun.You were one the few persons who completes the work without any complaints, actually its really damm difficult to find such persons.I would have never been able to do a thing like CIMA without you. I would never forget those sleepless nights we spent together near LT2 doing that animations and stuff.You are really wonderful friend and best person to work with. All the best for your future :)) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-jaini">Aditya Jaini</a></p>
<p>Sankalp Kulshrestha is one of the most motivated people around in campus. We first became friends during EPS in 2-1 and I have found since then that he is one of the most pleasant person to talk with (especially during mess when you need something to distract yourself from the food). Talking to him is a treat because he has a habit of adding a bit of drama to his stories which spice things up for his listeners. This habit earned him quite a few fans during EPS and after. He is of course very hard working (and forgive the EPS analogy here too but thats how I mainly know him :P ) because he used to be the first one to be ready with his speeches out there. That of course implies that he has one heck of an imaginative and purposeful mind. This mind he has applied to some seriously innovative shit with regards to programming (though I know only the TORA substitute) with great success. Thus with all of these fantastic qualities, I believe he will do brilliantly on the road ahead and entertain a lot of people with his stories and impress a lot of people with his creative mind. My very best wishes to you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>
