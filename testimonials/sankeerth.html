Nvr got the chance to hang out much with him due to different hostels except in ENI classes which surely was fun enough to remember my branch days . One of my branch buddies I would surely nvr forget :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gnv-bhargav">GNV Bhargav</a></p>
<p>Sankeerth is just awesome. In my first semester I thought he was this boring nerd, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. Apart from being really smart, the one thing that distinguishes him is his genuineness. He’s real fun to talk to as well. And a reliable provider of assignments and reports- thanks a ton for that!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>A true Godlike guy. Genius, hardworking, you will never see him sad. Always with a smile, he is ready to help you even if you wake him up from sleep. One of my very good friends, i dont know how i would i have been able to finish my graduation. Dude, u made engineering simple for me. Oh yeah!, he is a wonderful basketball player also. A fun loving guy. I hope he can reach great heights. Good Luck!!! He recently found love also. Good Luck with that also. :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Also called "ENI GOD", this person has got a good combination of both brains and hardwork. I first worked with him in PS1 and that was when I realized how committed he was to his work. He has also helped me giving reports and he will be available on gtalk for any clarification any time. He is also fun to talk and surprisingly one of his kind who never cries about getting low scores. Good Luck!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>One of my best buddies. Very hardworking i must say, if ther's any example to say "with hardworking and dedication comes success" he's the one ;). He's always fun to be around and talk to. He's been always the friend i would turn to for help. A good basketball and gully cricket player. I hope he finds success wherever he goes. Will miss him dearly :') and all the times we hung out together with smiles.... :(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/k--sharath-chandra">K  Sharath Chandra</a></p>
<p>One of the most studious guys in the hostel till the end of 3rd year 1st sem. But what a change after that unbelievable :P. You would always help all of the group in our acads without which our life would have been difficult. You are very childish in certain ways and you are very serious about your future, well planned. This will ensure for your successful life in your future. Please never forget me buddy.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>

<p>Sankeerth is one of my best friends in the campus.We both think similarly and we have almost similar tastes.I met him in workshop in 1-1, but since he is not from our hostel i dont know abt him much in 1-1. But our friendhip started in 1-2 through my favourite chemistry-2 class..We used to be very regualr to that class and infact we became closer to each other from then. He is ENI geek, very much pro in programming .There are lot of things common between me and him, the most imp thing was , we belong to same place hyderabad. So when we used to talk with each other we used to discuss lot of things in our own hyderabadi language . when we r together we discuss less abt studies and more abt mvies(hyderabadi),short films,girls and what not lot about other interesting stuff :P. He is godlike basket ball player and i dint got chance to watch his crick, but i heard he is a very gud crick player. He has lot of passion towards his carrier and im sure he will reach great heights. We will be in touch for our entire life , i hope we both shuld get in to same university or atleast near byuniversities for masters and shuld settle in hyd :) Have a great future buddy :) we shall rock in hyd after we pass out :) Miss u next sem in the campus..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raj-shekar">Raj shekar</a></p>

<p>Sankeerth!! ... One of my best ENI buddies!!... An awesome person..literally awesome. He does everything, an all-rounder. He is good in studies, plays cricket and basketball (good in both), and loves watching movies. In my first year, i didnt know him well. I thought " Here's another nerd". I think i became friends with him in my second year, because of MT1 i guess. And since then, we have been very good friends, almost like brothers. He helps me with assignments, reports and has done me numerous favours. He is the perfect knowledge bank of Electronics. He is a genius. Most important aspect of his character is his genuineness and honesty. He is a very down-to-earth guy because of which he has a large number of friends. He is always smiling.  He will surely reach greater heights. I wish him Good Luck for his future. Recently, he has found his Lady Luck! :P because of which he is smiling more often than before. Good Luck with that too bro!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>First Best Quality abt him is he can be a Gr8 Friend of Ne1 and evry1 which is a rare quality u find in ne person . Since he is my cousin it was quite planned that  we should take adjacent rooms when we join BITS , and blieve me hangouts in his room have been a gr8 fun part of my bits life. We used to have intellectual meetings in his room and discuss abt genuine issues ( u noe wht i mean :P ). He is a phodu of his own kind , has high concentration levels when he is interested , does the dumbest things when hez nt interested . He works hard to any extent to get the work completed especially when its coding. Apart from being a reliable basketball player , AH3 gully cricket star ..... he is a geek :P . A huge fan of 1990s movies and maintains a good collection of all kind of movies for ANY USE :P :P :P .  He is simply a _/\_  in electronics , a gifted programmer , can make ne person staying with him comfortable and thats how he makes frnds. 
He  is one such guy with whom u must hangout if u have been in hyderabad since a long time ....... and especially if u r really keen and involved in flying kites.,, coz hez just too awesum at it.   " Kite engineering " was gr8 fun with him during our 3rd year PONGAL festival when he literally f***** all the other flying kites with his abilities :P :D. 
A must mention part his abt his 3rd year when he had a TRUE LOVE ( u cant even imagine to what xtent it was TRUE) . It jus made my opinion stronger abt him of being a gr8 friend of ne1. A store house for any  EEE/ENI assignment solutions , will be willing to help ne 1 in acads to any extent even 1 hr b4 the xam.  Hez VERY scared of insects/lizards.... Will even leave his room if an insect occupies it. ( LAWL) ......  He finds it very difficult to speak to his crush and wont even have food for dat day if he finally somehow speaks to her on a day  :P.   Great lover of  Biryani as expected but always needs help in finishing it off :P.  We have shared many things from buckets to 'baigan' issues ( only hydis can understand dis ) :P:P ..... from trimmers to life twisters :P :P ..... Hope we still keep sharing things in our entire life.  He has been an influential person in my so far BITS life and i wont conclude his chapter in my life coz....... .... We will ALWAYS keep in touch :') :')  ( No senti feelings we r not goin to depart :-| :-| ) .........But still all the best for ur entire life Bitch :) ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/m-s-sandeep">M S Sandeep</a></p>
<p>Sanka :P , cool nice guy who always loves to sleep but still manages with exams even sleeping :) , childish and innocent at  things but realizes that very early :P :D , A pro in electronics subjects and has a great passion to do research in electronics field . Its been a great time living with him in the same corridor . good enthusiast of cricket . The very funny thing is you can befriend him very easily :P but hard to leave :) All the best for your bright career ahead  . Dont forget me other case there wont be people like me to help you in few important  things ;) Stay in touch<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/satya-deepak">Satya deepak</a></p>
