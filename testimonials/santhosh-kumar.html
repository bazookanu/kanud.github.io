<h1 class="page-title">santhosh kumar</h1><p>santosh commonly called as DOPY among us.. he is neither a co-di nor a core member of the dept. still he has been given dat name becoz he first got inducted into that department in his first sem... (he never worked for the department later.. the fact that whether he has been kicked out of the department or he himself came out remains as a mystery :D)... he is also a good volley ball player and the event manager for volleyball in spree 2012...he is a very hard working guy... and also very well plans his things from time to time... wishing u all the best for ur future... urs rakesh :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dammalapati-rakesh">Dammalapati Rakesh</a></p>

<p>Santhosh(DOPY) is one of the guys whom i should give credit for my cgpa. Forcing me to study and tolerating my irritating actions. He has been really important for me as without him it would have been difficult to tolerate the CS CDCs. I have literally spent all my CS life with him, doing the same elective, same COP and assignments. It was certainly a pleasure . Miss you... Hopefully we meet somewhere down the lane. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijat-chowdhary">Abhijat Chowdhary</a></p>
<p>Started calling him as dopy coz every1 got shocked as this guy got inducted into The Department of Photography (DoPy) who cant even take a b'day pic properly :P (Somehow, he managed to take one of my ever wanted pics properly in 2nd attempt though..i am grateful to him in that matter :P). Now-a-days, I prefer calling him "potti" as he is calling me the other way :@. He is hardworking, dedicated towards only a few things which he likes/wants/should do in his life. Sleepking-who sleeps as if he wont get time afterwards. A good friend who gives value to friendship. A talented person who can screw his T1,T2 and still manages to get a good GPA with the help of comprehensive(if u know what i mean :P). Likes to DF every1 whoever it might be. I am very happy for him as he became a family guy :). I wish you good luck in that matter. I wish you all the best for your future and hope we will get PS2 in same city atleast :P.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajay-kumar-gaddam">Ajay Kumar Gaddam</a></p>

<p>DOPY I dunno how this name got attached to u :P. Awesome hard worker though it pays u less, one day this all will be compensated with a greater reward for sure, so never stop ur struggle. You have a great way to piss people off but that's the way people r going to remember u, no matter wat people might say dont change bcoz sometimes i too lyk that :D. All the best for the long run ahead and hope u complete it successfully and achieve all the things ......(:P) and never forget me. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
