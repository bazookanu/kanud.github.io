<p>yo, the studd of physics. Truly an amazing person to be with. Always smiling, fooling around and laughing on random jokes (most of it are his own). His intelligence is something which is there for everyone to see and the thing that goes with it is his hard work. yet so down to earth and fun loving person. A true friend with a humble and kind attitude towards everyone. It was great knowing you mate. All the best for future and god bless :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>Santosh is one of the best guys I have ever met in my entire life. He is just so down-to-earth and person whom you can wake up at any part of the day and ask for some help. He gives you the most sincere of advice and that's why I really admire him. We've spent a lot of time studying in groups and I have cracked a lot of jokes on him ( very explicit indeed) and they still exist with us. I hope we never forget the fun we had. A pro with AAOCs ( for different reasons ) , he is the guy to look out for any kind of mathematical courses. Heard about him that he can just prove anything that is in the form LHS=RHS. That's one of his super-powers. Maybe he has some more, which I don't wanna mention here. You really are the best support I had ever found here. Now, I should get over with this or we'll be considered gay. :) Be strong....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>
<p>Adrss , my first friend in my bits life , He is talented person and a very jovial person . He is sensitive too at times and all  I would tell is you can trust him blindly on anything . You would be the best ideal of my friends of showing me to be responsible . And the moments too I would never ever forget the TRW Block format n your bavagaru :P in my life :D :D  . May be i was not knowing a few things unless you friends helped me out ! But  All i would end it up You are worthy of making better choices in life !!  Go ahead with your colorful future :D :)

<p>You are the first ever senior I came to know through those "friendly interactions" :D. From then, you have been a great help.. esp in the early days of the journey. I remember the night when you came all over to my hostel when I had some silly trouble! Though we had only limited interaction as time passed, I did get to know you quite well. All the best for the coming days! :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chandrahas-muvvala">Chandrahas Muvvala</a></p>

<p> Ramu..!!! This nickname of his might have one of the most interesting origins :P Santosh is one of the best friends I’ve made on campus that too in the last one year itself. He’s always helpful, a very down to earth guy with a few perversions here and there :P .But seriously he’s one of the most hard-working and intelligent guys around. You’ll never find a better lab partner than him.!! We had a lot of funny moments together; this guy has one of the most innocent smiles ever. I sometimes just crack some silly jokes as he can’t control his laughter and I like to watch him laughing uncontrollably. Also he’s notorious for his AAOC scandals :P We’ve had some amazing memories in his room during the nights before  exams. Sad thing he won’t be with me for next CDC’s. I know you’ll rock in whatever you like doing. Best of luck man..!! ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-krishna-kant">R Krishna Kant</a></p>

I never call him santosh. Hey RAMU whts up ?? A most clourful display of an 

indespensable object earned him the objects identity. First time saw a sober 

face with a umbrella and i was offered a chance to get under it on our way to 

VGH. Physics Introduction. That was how I met him. Nice dance he put on show 

at VGH. Then the association was going "OK" and the came third year !!!! And 

the curve of our frendship had its tanget equal to itself. Hard times all 

face, have to face, what matters is how u face it !! He is one of the 

strongest charcters I have seen. He doesnt let u into his circle that soon and 

hates being taken care of . So the moment u realize that u are being asked for 

help O man u r previlaged. Has a damn fasination for biscuits. Brotherly is 

what u feel when u befriend him. In search of a down to earth, straight 

forward genuine person ?? Take his ADRSS. Opti Opre \m/. What awesome times we 

had. Still remember the veg sandwich !! He has got probably the best ears on 

sale(obviously u have to earn it) coz when you speak to him he doesnt miss 

a Fc******* punctuation. Hence I share things with him tht probably no-body 

knows i have ;) . If U can auction his smile, the highest bidder will go too 

high !! AAOC, AAOC, everybody on alert, Coz here comes the heavy weight 

champion weighing 2times average, straight from B5A3, "Saaantooouuush". Sucess and friends will always decorate ur pathway. And RAMU will always be one of my bestest best buddies !!!!!!  Friends we will be forever !! Man I will miss You !!   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/souvik-dutta">Souvik Dutta</a></p>
<p>Santosh "zindagi kaa doosra naam problem hai" 8-D . Although we used to have very little conversation earlier but now every conversation starts with @#$#$#$ :D. Sad that we wont be in same corridor next year :|. A really nice and helping person. Wish you all the best for future and touch mein toh rahenge hee ;) .

P.S: I think you are the only person whom I have taught something useful ;).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>
<p>Santosh aka ADDRSS aka RAMU. A person with a golden heart. Simple down to earth person. Enjoy’s life and tries to study hard. He totally rocked OPRE with his endeavours with Mr. Sethia. Ask him about it...:D. He’s been to rough times but he managed it very well. He’s very responsible and anytime of the day u can ask him for his help and will help u eagerly. A great guy to hangout with. Its been a fun experience with you, I hope you will attain real heights. Good luck with EEE.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
