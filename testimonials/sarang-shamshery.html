<h1 class="page-title">Sarang Shamshery</h1><p>Shady!! Love him or hate him just cant ignore this guy (though I prefer to do the former). The first person I got to know at BITS, its been a great 3 years (most of which has been spent trying to wake him from his deep slumber). Superb guitarist, crazy gamer and one of the most nicely irritating friends I've come across. :P Popular for all the wrong reasons, this guy must be the only person who knows the answers to all Mech papers before hand. Will miss banging on his door every single morning, and having to listen to the irritating AOE/DOTA chants and cheap RAP music! Grades lite le bhai, just have fun (and guitar sikha de yaar).

<p>hmm sarang... the only person i knew before coming to BITS. He was with me during my 3 years in assam, and now 3 years at BITS. Always the guy with connections, and great people skills. Made friends with lots of awesome people because of him.. A very passionate person, gives more than 100% to whatever he likes doing(read guitar and gaming _/\_) Thank you buddy for being such an important part of my life throughout the years. Keep rocking \m/ <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ahut-gupta">Ahut Gupta</a></p>
<p>Sarang ! We were orkut buddies even before coming to BITS and how we got to know each other here on campus was pretty dramatic. On the first week, We were playing caroms and he asked me " Do u know Anantaram?" :D ! Very Cool guy, jovial and Considerate ! Its been a wonderful journey with lots of cherished memories - Outings, Road trips, Late night chats (the Epic unforgettable CP night) ! Hail all the crazy talks we have had ! I m so glad we met ! Will miss u bro ! But we still have one sem and lets make tht... wait for it... LEGENDARY !!!

<p>Shady bro !!! How can I sum up the times with you man !! It'll be toooo much . I din kno much about you in the 1st yr . Subsequent year when you and Mudit started teaching me guitar , I got to know you much better . Bahut hi sahi banda hia yar tu . :) ...I can just talk any random crap to him . I am a really big fan of your voice or sound or something i donno . Remember once , I was going like " Sarang , pls kuch bolte reh yar , bahut acha lag raha hai sunne me :D . " Fantastic guitar player , each jam session with you I used to learn something new . You are one of the very fair ppl i know . I am surely gonna miss our chats in CP or at the stairs . A true gamer , DOTA AOE /\ . Also is a good baddy and TT player . He is a guy who keeps trying new things and is never afraid of going out of his comfort zone .. I cant imagine how my college life would have shaped up without you . Ate a lot at your room , ur kettle and the maggies were a delight when I stayed over for a workshop in December . .. He also sings decently . One of the guy you want around while boozing . Serious fun was this last yr . It was so good that we came close . I hope we dont loose touch . I soooo kno you'll achieve everything you want in life man . Naukri de dio  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/himanshu-gangal">Himanshu Gangal</a></p>

<p>Shady....the man with all the contacts. Knows how to get things done, be it learning some subject from someone, or not getting fined for coming late to campus, or sneaking priceless Godgamer shirts :P (mujhe nahi diya >.<). While we met in the first sem, in the disaster of a club that was CDC, we used to ignore each other at that time :D. And then, we became very good friends over a period of weeks in the second sem, as we started learning aoe. One of the more consistent performers of our clan ( read as being NOT epic :P ), he is one of the best on campus. Being good at AoE is just one of his many talents. An excellent guitarist, a very good tt player, awesome at badminton, and still pretty good at acads, he is one guy you would like to have as your friend. Thinking of the past 3 years, I remember all the fun times, the post-game discussions, watching recos, matka me going to cc and specing pros, you 
doing chudaap from my room and trying to irritate me :P. Lets hope we have an awesome last sem in ch1. Wish you all the best for your future. Stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-chandramouli">Varun Chandramouli</a></p>
