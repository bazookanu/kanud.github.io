title: SARANSH RAWAT

<h1 class="page-title">SARANSH RAWAT</h1><p>i got to know him well in my second year. he might be a little pakaaofying but with no malice in his heart! a really nice and warm person to work with. quite loud at times (thanks to his haryanvi tradition) but he'll never intend  to hurt you or insult you whatsoever. will always cherish the moments spent in his room; be it a Friends episode or a movie. 
also the awkwardly hilarious facebook moments :)
Wish you all the luck for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>When i first met Saransh I mistook him for deepak who looked exactly same !! But as days progressed Saransh showed us that he is a truly unique and amazingly cheerful guy :D . He has the ability to learn any new talent withtin days( keyboard god already :O ) . His excellence in academics as well as in socialising with almost everyone in the hostel has inspired me for the three years that I have known him. The dry and boring mt2 chemistry lab experiments which we performed together were made interesting and funny by this north indian Rajni :D .  Thanks for being a wonderful friend and wish u all the best for your future !!! :)

<p>A nice person to talk to and has one of the cleanest rooms in the hostel. Apart from the weird mouse he has, is bilkul bindaas. We have had many memorable trips together, especially that palolem one :) And of course, the mess trips with the constant regionalism going on, he was the one who was silent :P It was a pleasure knowing you.
May you have a happy and bright future :) All the Best.

<p>I first met Saransh during our MT-2 labs and it was then I realized that I used to often confuse him with Deepak (although I don't know why since I didn't know the latter so well) anyway...working with him was a really great experience...we had a gala time in the labs....One of the few backbenchers in our class jo haath mein sirf ek notebook leke class aata hai...it seems as though he has a holiday almost everyday...pata hi nahi chalta class jaa rha hai ki nahi (probably becz he doesn't carry a bag unlike us)....usko hamesha lagta hai ki we girls are sincere and hardworking but he fails to look at how dedicated and hardworking a person he is...he is a nice person to talk to and is extremely helpful. I hope that we always are able to stay in touch....it was an absolute pleasure knowing you..good luck for your journey ahead and out of BITS...hope u scale great heights not to fall..but to reach the zenith of your career. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Saransh Rawat. I wish his name was Baransh Rawat, then what everyone calls him would have been his official name too :P. He is the person who speaks less, listens more. The guy who is least affected by others' opinions. Love ur this attitude. Had amazing mess chats & some awesome trips with him. He is really a nice person and always fun to hang out with. And yeah how can i forget that he almost topped opti & opre: The OPGOD. Stay the same always Rawat. All the best for ur future!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>“Summary” (name given to him by me) is what I call him. One of the most cheerful , most enthusiastic  and ever smiling guy I have met. Kabhi kuch bura bhi hoga to haste haste bolega “ Bawa mari padi hai” He is that one guy who will phodufy a course without even coming to a single class and he has some kind of obsession with maths courses (none of them left uncracked :P). His room is definitely cleanest room of BITS. It isso clean and organized that sometimes I wonder that every single object of his room has fixed co-ordinates. He is someone who is always ready to help you anytime with anything( before exam or during exams :P) . He is very hardworking and has a lot of patience and most importantly has a good heart. Though sometimes he tries to become cool but thik hai mostly successful ho hi jata hai :P. All that time spent with you will always be cherished and thanx for being an amazing friend. I am sure you will scale great heights in future… Ob we wil be in touch :-) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neeraj-singh">Neeraj Singh</a></p>

<p>Chocolate boy face , pleasing smile, carefree attitude and red vest, these are the attributes that define saransh rawat. Possessing one of the cleanest rooms in our hostel, this guy is a man of immense determination. He has some weird obsession with AAOC Course, he just cant resist topping in these courses. He has a complete array of self created spoofs of songs.Extremely athletic, he just love to lead our group, be it 100 meters of mess or 10 km of doodhsagar trail.A good critic who is never shy in expressing his opinion.His self confidence,hard work and sincerity are inspiring and it will be no surprise if he makes in life.
