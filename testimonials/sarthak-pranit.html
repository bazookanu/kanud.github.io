<h1 class="page-title">Sarthak Pranit</h1><p>Pranitt!! yes it was like a GMAT essay, no i m not kidding! Okay i am kidding, anyway so yeah back to PRANITT!! We met in our first year, i don't remember how but all i remember is getting confused about whether your name was Sarthak or Pranit! I dont know whether it was Dosm, bogmalo or simply the person u are that made us such amazing friends. We truly "clicked", as they say! Extremely witty with an amazing sense of humor, he is really someone who you can talk to about anything, i mean anything. Super talkative, he can put all those proclaimed chatterboxes to shame. I will always remember the countless gossiping sessions we had about everyone and everything.  Super chilled out and super smart, you are always fun to hang around with. I will really miss our bogmalo sessions, sitting in the audi(on the floor during Waves) and making fun of every performance that happened, Mongi times oh and not to forget the library times that we spent! :P I know you will make it big and that day i will totally show off that i knew you! All the best for life and a happy "high" future! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Sarthak or Pranit...whats your name was my first question to him. And dint figure it out till the end of the first year. I remember him as the guy who use to wear the "Army" t-shirt 24x& in the first year and we got talking when I was making fun of his haircut once. Since then its been a very fun (partly hilarious, partly sarcastic ride.) We've worked together in DoSM, on numerous projects, ventures and case competitions. Enthusiastic with some amazing ideas its been great knowing him. He can kill you with his cheap jokes (literally) but also laughs at the cheapest of jokes. I'm sure you're gonna make it big in life (hopefully with "Sophrad"). In short he is a true F&P-er. (For details about F&P, plz contact me or Sarthak) :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>Pranit, it was a pleasure to work with you for the TEDx website. I really love the fact that you're open to all kinds of ideas and are ready to take risks. That's one hell of a thing! And you remember when I met you near shop co and all I said was, "The weather's too bad!". Too random of me to say that :P Haha. It's good to know you. Will surely stay in touch with you. All the best with everything you do.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-pant">Aniket Pant</a></p>
<p>Yo macha!! These are two words that he uses like always and which describe his attitude very precisely!!!...What can i say about Sarthak that has not already been said!!..:P..We have had endless talking sessions at monginis (even a day before exams :P)...Every time you meet him and has something new and totally delightful to talk about!!...The outing we had to bogmalo during spree was just epic and unforgettable!!..We laughed like hell and talked total crap!!!..:P..And for all those who haven't yet seen his ID pic...please do!!..(its damn hilarious!!..:D)....And yeah how can i forget mentioning about christening you Play Boy!!! :D( Proud owner of Playbook huh :D)...Damnation ka radio toh \m/ ( one thing that keeps me going through the terrible exams!!..:D)...All in all it has been great times of fun and highness :P...And there are so many things that are to be said but can't be mentioned here!!..:P..Dude you better keep in touch( not really giving an option out here!!)...We have witnessed a lot of epic moments together and there are a lot more to come!!!..:D..Keep rocking macha!!...:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>Diplomatic and Hard Working are the two qualities(?) that I think best sum up Sarthak. It all started with DoSM and kind of ended with TEDxBITSGoa but it certainly was a learning experience working with him. Will always remember the long TEDx / Entrepreneurship /DoSM and THE TEDxBITSGoa vs DoSM Discussion. From Confirming amazing sponsors and speakers to being a 5P from an 8P Sarthak has done it all. A guy who always gets what he sets his mind on to. Wishing you the Very Best in life =)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-verma">Shivam Verma</a></p>
<p>He is smart, geeky, socially very active, knows tons of people,creative,extremely unique, caring, bindaas and open minded.He is naughty, crazy, party animal, flirty and cute ( don't kill me for that!! :D ) We have been friends for sometime now and I have loved every moment of it.He has made me laugh so much and managed to turn my mood around so many times! I try to do the same for him, don't know how many times I have succeeded though :P. We have spent some wonderful times and our conversations are always so interesting!! :D He is the one person I can always want to hang out with,and a person I can discuss anything with! His highness make for some pretty amazing times! He is like the awesome friend everyone wants to have! He has loads of hotshot plans and I am sure they will all be successful.You are someone I am going to miss terribly because your just the best! And I will keep troubling you for a long long time, yo macha !! :-* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>
<p>Hey Sarthak(or Pranit, your name goes both ways ;) ).  “Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'”, this song by Limp Bizkit reminds you of something? We’ve known each other for almost an year by now, and the first time I met you, you were chilling at Bogmalo. And that same thing has happened countless times till now. TedX convenor is a pretty big thing, and you handled it very well. I’m just sad that I wasn’t there to witness TED the day you said that legendary dialogue of yours :P. You’re one of those people who can eschew double entendres at the correct moment, and I’ve always enjoyed that. Stay in touch, man :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-bhatt">Chaitanya Bhatt</a></p>
<p>Wow, so many words come to mind (so less that can be said out in public). 
One of my best friends, real workaholic, hard working and intelligent. I respect him coz he is one friend who thinks practical, makes the right choices and inspires. I hate him coz of "lite only"  "yo macha" and "sup men". Man u think but u don't really pull these of.
Thanks for making all those train journeys and college life interesting. Keep up your confidence and hard work, you shall be really successful in life.
P.S. : i said tht so that u can fulfill ur promise of the mansion u want to gift me :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>(Hope this aint a belaTED testimonial)

Spent SO much time with you and had so many...uhm....moments with you that its just not possible to keep track! :-D There's Cleo, CIMA, tinku-bashing-sessions, me-getting-bashed-sessions, our-joke-sessions and of course ALL those moments when Mitesh seemed to walk in with a camera for some unknown reason. :-D
Bhai we've had a blast and its just been one helluva ride!  And there's not a single thing I regret (except letting the camera in. :-P) Mood bana deta hai yaar tu! Never had a dull moment with you around. Hell, even when you were lying in the MedC I had a good time. (Come to think of it, that was an exceptionally fun time! :-P)
Your the man who made me love Yes, Minister and hate "SOCIAL MEDIA"! :-D 
Yo macha (I hate you saying that though, please stop! Im serious.) your the brattiest, craziest, awesomest guy whose cheap jokes makes me feel good about my sense of humour! :-D
Despite being sober i haveta say I love you bro! . Just next time, lets go watch Xmen and not Bheja Fry please. :-P
Have a great life and do end up  doing whatever you want to (to whoever you want to :-D)

And ya, do lemme know where Orissa is. Chirag and I still searching. :-P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maanit-mehra">Maanit Mehra</a></p>
<p>There are a very few who have achieved as much in BITS life as Sarthak has. Nerd, Geek, Pro, Stud and finally Dude, you have done it all. You personify "like him, hate him, but you definitely can't  ignore him". I consider you as one of the people who molded me into the BITSian I am.  Hope you lead wherever you go, because that is what you are made for. Thank you for being there.

<p>Sarthak Pranit - you may know people for your life but you may still not connect to them, but this is one hell of a guy with whom my wavelength matched the instant we met. He has done all that has to be done in campus from academics, co-curricular activities to 'extra'-curricular activities. With great writing skills and conversational abilities he is sure to go far.  Being TEDx curator this year he proved his worth and I m pretty sure he is going to make it big someday. A vivid personality who enjoys everything he does(listening to music I would say is his favourite other than the obvious one) and surely the times spent at Utorda, Bogmalo, NC, his room, my room, mudits room and where else will not be forgotten. I know there is much more that can be written. Thank you for all that you've done. Just cant help posting the following line,
"Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be this hard"

And of course such a big the pani-puri fan is a little difficult to find :) But best toh yaar dumb- cherades hain! kya dimaag lagata hain kisi bhee muvee mein!!!! kamal kar detaa!!! :P :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yashu">Yashu</a></p>
