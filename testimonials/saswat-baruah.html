<h1 class="page-title">Saswat Baruah</h1><p>Frankly, i don't remember how we met, but i'll remember always how we part...You, Saswat, are like a rain on a sunny day. You just might be the most compassionate fellow i've met in college. Being your friend has been an awesome experience.
saswat has a reputation - for being late - for exams, for mess. i think he's the one person who when you ask at 8:25 : "exam nahi hai kya?" will say :" abhi 15 minutes baad jaaunga"!!! Hilarious. Admirable the fact that he has just so many friends!! Shows what a wonderful guy he really is. Yes he has irritated me enough, but i dont regret it. May you have the best that life has to offer. You say you wanna be a teacher, i'm sure you'll be a fabulous one. And Yes - you sing well!! Believe it or not. You're a great friend. All the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
<p>Saswat is one of the laziest guys I have met. Hence the name Lebda raam. But when it comes to Linux and shit he transforms into this geek who seems to know it all. The guy who has probably seen all the movies available on DC and still wants to see more. He has been one of the few guys with whom I can really discuss anything and he always listens and gives his honest opinion. Its sad seeing you cracking a 8+ GPA in your first sem and ending up with a CG like mine after the 3rd year but I understand that some things are more important than acads. Hope you live a nice life and achieve all the success you have dreamed of.
