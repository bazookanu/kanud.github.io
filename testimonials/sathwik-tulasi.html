<h1 class="page-title">Sathwik tulasi</h1><p>i feel really stupid to write testimonial to a person who z the best part of lyf.. im really confused ver to start, nd if i start ver to end.. diz lil guy who looks really innocent is nt at all innocent.. he z a person wid craziest ideas.. very intelligent(bt neva uses his intelligence :P)

<p>First thing That would cross your mind seeing this slender - not so tall guy (:P) is the word - COOL! With those hands in his pockets and smile straight from his heart - he exhibits a very carefree and jovial personality all the time. Have seen you first time in Nescafe talking to one of our common friends and first thought in me was - 'How can this guy be so happy in BITS $-/' ..... But knowing you more all these 3 years - keep smiling Sathwik :) and strive hard to maintain that !! :D A very Sharp Brain he is - m sure - thoda aur padhta toh sabki chutti kar deta EEE me ... but i guess he is just too good to not allow EEE faculty sadism to show up on his grades :P One of the most humorous and witty people I know! Best of Luck for your Future Sathwik garu :P ...... I can so confidently say - follow your instincts! because you are one of the masterpiece combinations of a great heart and smart brains :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
<p>Satty.!!!  you can't always find persons of your kind,...the perception,the extent of being selfless and more!! He is defintely the one for me i'd say!! Man,bloody intelligent guy but hell ya lazy!! since first yr we have always been together almost everything!! be it anything,done many weirdest and whackiest things out in!!! Many a parties,on the roof high times!! Even in getting caught with something prohibited!! he is with me!! :P .Sleeps half the life,boozes one-fourth,and if he feels that he has ample free time then rarely acads!!knows every damn thing in my life!!He is the the who i always aimed at, if i need to throw some sadness  and i feel free!! Always makes fun of me in evrything,be it anything,CS...which he hates the most :P,acads :P,and many a censored stuff!! But one thing i am sure,you'd defintely be the man with evrything in near future.Last sem and that too over!! :(.But it's weird to say that i am  gonna miss you...how can i miss you assole :D.We are always together till one of our service life ends... to say till T=min(Tandy,Tsatty) :P.i dont know i just wrote that...may be coz i am high right now!! As i always say... we can as well manage somehow to be in the same firm!!be it anything....We miss many people,but some ppl... we miss them more than what you think one's absence would make you feel.Damn...what the heck..why does there have to be an end for everything!! You mean a lot to me!!Take care!!Dont ever let the smile down!! Dont evr forget that their is a guy for you anytime and in anything you need.Adios!!! :)<3.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anudeep-bodireddy">Anudeep Bodireddy</a></p>
<p>Sattttty..!!!!!! Cool ppl lyk us dont need long testimonials.. :P
We knw so much abt each other that if we decide to write a testimonial it wud become a book :P 
I can say this guy is like a male version of myself.. we have almost everything in common xcpt that i am a veggie and a few other things.. that makes it easy to talk to him abt nyting coz its lyk talking to myself..  and he wud understand....
I had many memorable moments with u.. and sattyy we will surely implement our crazy ideas someday..
n its not a goodbye coz i knw we'll surely meet.. keep rocking the sameway.. n yea plz put  on some weight :P :D tc :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kavya-gayatri">Kavya Gayatri</a></p>
