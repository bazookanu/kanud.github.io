<h1 class="page-title">Satya deepak</h1><p>Hi Deepak, Its since 4 years I have known you. I cant say that all the moments with you are memorable as most of the time we are fighting or arguing on some silly topics. May be that is the best way to remember you for the rest of my life.. :P just kidding. But I will never forget your way of saying things and giving covering for the mistakes you do... :D
All da best for your rest of your life and never forget me when you are in any trouble. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>

<p>yo dfak. :) Lot to say about him.Hardcore EnI patriot. Cool guy and i bet u can't dare to lose a friend like him. Really,a good all-rounder in cricket. He is unlike any other guy-he speaks whatever he has in mind unlike those who criticize at your back. Its one of the best qualities i like in him.I wish he will keep it up. You can tease him as long as u wish, he takes it sportively-unlike most of us who can't last patience for a while. I wish all the best for his future studies and career. Will miss you next year for sure..Anyways,remember, I will be there for you any time in any situation :). Keep in touch.
