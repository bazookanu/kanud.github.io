<p>Satya Prakash Dash, Lord of all the 

fishes in the seas and beasts on 

land, uncrowned King of Scotland and 

the benevolent Dictator of the 

Republic of Wadiya, OBE, VSM, KC, has 

been a good leader of men and women 

alike throughout the last year as THE 

Chief in DoJMA. Writer far past any 

standard of excellence and orator 

superb enough to overshadow TEDx 

speakers, he has constantly 

fascinated me with his absolutely 

superb command over the Queen's 

lingo. Been a great friend for all 

these 3 years that we have been in 

the department together; and even if 

most of my memories concerning you 

are mainly issue-related, they still 

are worth treasuring. Oh, and any 

write-up about Satya would be 

incomplete without a reference to his 

\m/ pics on fb/gtalk/orkut/herald/you 

name it. A born poser, he has 

mastered the art of completely 

snatching away attention from other 

people unfortunate enough to be in 

the same pic :D Will cherish all the 

good times that we have spent 

together over these years.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>Satya Prakash Dash, without a doubt, is one of the best writers and orators one would come across in BITS. With an impressive command on both the written and the spoken word, he has managed to charm one and all, in his various stints, whether it be as a member of TEDx in 2011, radio team member in 2011 or as Spree 2010 Cricket Commentator.   As the chief Coordinator of DoJMA, he successfully led the department to unprecedented heights, and was responsible for many of its success stories. His knowledge about various fields, be it sports, (with particular reference to cricket and football), literature, or politics, has and continues to astound everyone,  and takes the centre stage in any conversation. And yet again, he could pass for a fashion model, with his timing and sense. All in all, Satya is a person who is sure to have a successful career, and I wish him all the best for all his endeavors in life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vipul-pandey">Vipul Pandey</a></p>
<p>A great writer, even great poser, and an awesome senior to work under for a year. It was a great time working for DoJMA under you. Will cherish those few days. Also, I hope to someday, be close to hohw much you are, at posing. :D All the best for future. Have a wonderful life. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavul-gauri">Bhavul Gauri</a></p>
<p>Ah, writing about the writer... What to say, so many words come to mind. I could say things like gr8 writer, amazing poser, multi-talented..... but these things have been taken care of and hardly matter in my friendship with him... I feel shortage of words here, infact I can never describe my friendship with this guy. He is a real gemstone, loyal friend and possessor of a great character. Thanks for making this college life memorable and as i always say may you achieve success beyond imagination. :')<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>

<p>Satya's the poster boy of DoJMA. The guy can talk, write, dance, get pictures clicked, throw attitude around and what not. My fuhrer has been a great friend throughout the past 2.75 years. The long meetings, internal gossips or general gossips or just general bashing of people, open to all general body meeting on satya's relationship status were super phun times. I wish you and your king's english go a long way. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
