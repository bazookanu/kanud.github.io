<p>D one who has made my college life so easy!! First lets  start wid d gud things in u :)
I really admire ur way towards life.Dere r so many things i love abt u .... 
If i m a little practical now rather dan being stupid and emotional its undoubtedly coz of u.
I know we hav more year nd u can keep on teasin me abt dis :P but i cant deny dis fact.

I will always remb ur conditions before exam nites :P (omg it scared me some tyms) bt at d same tym i admire d fact dat u unlike oderes are so not affected by what 
people say and belive in what you do.

Ur oversensitive skin when it cums to tickling ,ur stomach upsets just before u have to leave for home,d many flight cancellations nd postponing which u do,
nd d tension to get tanned :P 
Bt i cant think saumya widout all of dese.
I remember d semester when d only thing we used to do was to sit outside library nd watch ppl playing frisbee fr hours.At d end of day  we would discuss how we wasted tym sitting there but cum back to our routine the very next day !! :) :P 
 There is so much I can write once i have started writing but i think the awesome bonding which i have with you sums it all. :)
I will always cherish our friendship.
Thanks for standing beside me at all times!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khushboo-matreja">Khushboo Matreja</a></p>
<p>i wonder if there could have been a name more appropriate for u...'saumy' is the word that describes you perfectly....! very soft spoken...there is an aura of calmness around you..something which tells me 'everythng's gonna be fine'!.. 
U can find her dozing off in Patnaik's classes or making random drawings on the desks :P...at times u have to poke her to wake her up....very artistic and creative.....( painted many T-shirts and gets such amazing ideas for greeting cards!! )..a chilled out person but takes too much tension before exams...(remember MOS ;) )...
studying was never so as much fun before I met you :)... those last minute preparations of Economics CDCs, d tym pass sessions, Namrata's special appearances (:D) and random gossip  will always remain fresh in my memory! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruthi-srinivas">Shruthi Srinivas</a></p>
<p>Saumya has her own way of life! Sab kuch mast aaramse aur shanti se karti hai bandi ..! In the class she is alwayz  having that mysterious expression. :) ! & also that mysterious cool smile .. ..Extremely Calm & soft spoken !..A regular @10pm monginis customer !.. keep that smile on! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-ramesh-maheshwari">Rachit Ramesh Maheshwari</a></p>
<p>Although i have know saumya from not so long, she is someone who is chilled out and relaxed all the time! Sometimes she carries that mysterious expression on her face and it is hard to guess what's going on in her mind. She is total fun loving and has a great fascination for Cats or I should say Cats are fascinated to her :P It was a pleasure having you as a batchmate and friend!! Wish you all the best! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>My fairest friend( khush ho ja!!!)
 Saumya is chocolate crazy!!  Chocolate, in any form, is her weakness. Very particular about her (sooo sensitive) skin :P  …loves food and travelling…..  at first I used to think how on earth can someone speak so less… and  that Donald duck face u make :P  well now I can only thank you for waking me up and pushing me to study and the awesome parathas, …. :D one thing I totally admire bout you, is your daily yoga…wonder how do you manage to do that!!! There are many things one can learn from you! 
PS: I love your tiny-miny cartoons ?

<p>saumya is such a soft spoken and calm person that her fun side is not the first impression u get when u meet her....i really admire ur way of getting along so easily with everyone and nd of doing everything so much aaram se....amazing cartoonist nd i love the tshirts tht u paint fr urself....obviously the fairest person i know (the only one fairer thn u is my little 2 yr old cousin :)) ....it was gr8 being with u......be happy always<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-aggarwal">Megha Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>one of my first friends on campus, with whom i ended up doing a lot of crazy stuff in the first year :P:P
we are fated to b togethr, neighbours in ch5 and same branches. i dnt think you will ever manage to get rid of me :P
a very creative and hardworking person. we keep having small tiffs every now and then but it has been really nice knowing you. al the best for everything :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-gupta">Arushi Gupta</a></p>
<p>A sweet, soft spoken, creative and hard-working girl. I don’t exactly remember how I met her, but it was great knowing her. I am amazed to see how she sticks to her daily routine so strictly. I am sure that without her saying “jaldi padhai karo aur bakwaas band karo”, we would not have been able to get those few hours sleep before the exams. Every time she comes back from home, she would call all of us and say “room aa jao, ghar se khaane ka saman layi hoon”. I will surely miss all these moments and my fairest friend (its compulsory to include this ;)). Wish you the the best for your life ahead. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
<p>Saumya Gupta!!! the first thing that comes to my mind is the time during our first sem... wen we were all so excited for waves (rem the preps :P)... ohh that was wonderful!!! and then soon we grew friends and she turned out to be a sweet, cute (my cutie pie :D), always smiling, and a hard-and-fast disciplined girl.  its always been wonderful wen she and khushboo come and narrate their each and every adventure with so much of enthusiasm... i simply love it :D always stay the way u r .... love u loads... keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankita-mahapatra">Ankita Mahapatra</a></p>
<p>Saumya! Fair and dainty, this girl has been my SOP buddy, my kayak partner, my group member in most eco assignments and what not! I have always had a blast with her! We have laughed and chatted almost every afternoon during our walks to A mess, through the pathways. I learnt names of new Noidan dishes, like Mathri (Hahahaha! :P) from her. We had fun doing the whole barging into people's room's and demanding 'Show me your saree' moments before the farewell - (Though I wasn't keen on this activity, but it is addictive! :D). So all in all there was never a boring moment with her. She is one of the most helpful and nicest people I know. Stay the same Saumya. Don't ever change!

<p>I met a lot of random people in the fisrt few days of college,but only saumya is the one person who has been there right from sem1,we have shared a lot of study time :P :P she really has inspired a lot of to study in groups (PHY1,EG,Chem1,workshop we have done a lot of courses together).....i think exam time is the only time when saumya is all tensed otherwise she'll be just fine..also She will silently support u through ur bad times.a sweet ,soft spoken (mostly :P) girl,very creative just love all ur tshirts,cartoons...had a gr8 tym making all the b'day cards with you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-jain">sakshi jain</a></p>
<p>Saumya used to look very scary when I first met her :P, with the mysterious expression she sports (not soo mysterious now :P )……She is also very creative, brilliant cartoonist, paints beautiful tshirts and makes absolutely amazing birthday cards……She has a very sensitive skin because of which one can make her laugh like crazy by poking her :D ……only she can sleep soundly in the 2nd bench of the class not caring what teacher is teaching :P……. She will be the first person to start studying before the exams and I never seen some1 get soo tensed up before exams as she does…..even with all the tension she manages to do really well in her exams…..she is very helpful and also a good teacher, dunno what would have happened in the POE exam had it not been for ur teachings …..She can surprise u when u least expect it(like the day u shouted at the waiter at John’s :P :D ),showed us a completely different saumya :D ……..its very funny to watch  her when she starts worrying abt her Fair complexion :P and her amazing health forecasts(don’t think even weather forecasts are that accurate)…… going to miss all those amazing times like killing soo much time just talking with all of us together, be it at bench or mongi , our trips outside, fighting over chappal and chocolates :) ……You are one of the most determined persons I ever met and  ur determination will take to places….All the very best for ur future and  hope u achieve all ur dreams :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/moheth-koppolu">Moheth Koppolu</a></p>
<p>Saumya- The quirkiest one among us :P Initially, I found your obsession with urself n ur complexion hilarious :D :D still do :P but to each their own :) u have times when u wrk urself into a state and usually end up fulfilling ur predictions of approaching maledictions :P Yet, u remains an extremely understanding n helpful individual , with more patience than I am ever likely to possess :P (same for art sense ) color combinations though , u could take tips from me :) i have lost count of all the cards u have contributed to for all of us :D (ur long standing offer of painting my plain shirts , while appreciated .. no go :P ) Trying to teach u to defend urself has not been a resounding success i confess :P nor have been our attempts to cure u of ur laughter problem :P With the amount of hardwork n dedication that u display , I am certain u'll succeed in life :)
thank you for three years of unforgettable memories :) tc :)
Caution - It is advised to the general public - never rely on her sense of direction :P ever .. ever Ever EVER :P
