<p>Aha.. Morrie, a very great man he is, always ready to help, intelligent, hard working. You can never seen him without his ear to ear grin, he is always very calm and is a great listener. Always giving those epic expressions, cant forget your "ek last Debo" and "accountant mat ban Debo engineer ban engineer" followed by your expressions for "heaven" and "typing". It has been an amazing journey with you. I wish you a very good luck for your life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-kumar-jha">Amit Kumar Jha</a></p>
<p>Nayak! I have known this great guy since 11th Std.  (Go Ruparel \m/ ) He was my electronics partner and I still remember the mind-blowing diagram of the analog multimeter that he drew in his manual on Day 1 of our Electronics Lab Practicals! Amazing it was!  :)
Saurabh is one of the most economically educated people I know, and I wonder if I shall ever come across someone who is more informed about the economic state of every possible nation/state/universe that can possibly be! We crack many jokes and its fun to laugh along with this guy! He finally took us for the Eco Trip! He was a fine EcoSoc Co-ordinator. Saurabh is one of the most helpful people I have come across and has a a heart of gold. It's always fun to hang around him. Stay the same! Don't ever change!
Cheers, =)

<p> Shehenshah Moriz! Firstly don't dare make this testimonial private. :P Have sort of known Mori since ma' college days but BITS gave us the opportunity to really hit if off. Remember meeting him during my first few days on campus, (courtesy Shreyas and HC), what with his bicep popping sleeveless shirts, ear to ear grin, and giganormous nostrils! But it was when he really gelled into our present group that the fun times started. Always ready to lend a helping hand and impart a brutal ear bashing (laced with frustrated gaalis of all sorts) in equal measure, Saurabh's company has always been enjoyable. Whether laughing at him or with him, Mori's been an almost integral part of our group. Your "Debo accountant mat ban, Inggginneer ban" will be remembered forever and so will be your rivalry with the "real economist", Rachit. Watch out for this guy, he might just become the RBI governor someday (a serious upgrade from his present post of Eco Coordi) with his signature on each and every fricking note of the country (a truly facepalm moment for our beloved Bharat).:D. Have loved being surrounded by your emotions, your nakhras, your fury and frustration, your drunkness, your wierd laugh, your inflated nostrils, your eco-ness, your dombi-ness and just you. Wish you the best of luck for the future and hope you drive the economy of this nation to great heights (and not depths), one day. Cheerzz! PS: You should give me and Nob credit for making the Mori brand such a house-hold name in BITS.:D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
