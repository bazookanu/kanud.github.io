<h1 class="page-title">Saurav kumar</h1><p>Apne chote sarkar. The GOD of AOM. He is the guy with ultimate knowledge of anything & everything. He's always the best at whatever he does by choice. Very helpful & supportive person. A bit egotistic though. Anyone will surely like his company.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>Privileged to be his friend. He is bloody helpful, fun to be with, a great character, committed to what he likes and a smart guy as such. His enthusiasm is infectious I must admit. He was one of my first friends in this campus and will continue to be my friend long after we have parted from this institution. Have spent some quality time with him, moments that I will cherish throughout my life. We have quite a few things in common and also of course a few differences. Still can't understand his obsession with Germany,Dada, Nadal :P. Best of luck to him in his future endeavors. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/balaaji-mahadevan">Balaaji Mahadevan</a></p>
<p>former TT champion...Used to beat me all the time...I will always remember the 7.30 dinner with him, yafiz,tyagi and balaji. We first met in 1-1 when we did a robotics workshop together. Then onwards our friendship continued. A simple man with very high capabilities to kidnap etc.( He is from Bihar so kidnapping is a born talent for him)
Ich w√ºnsche Ihnen alles Gute.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Bunty!! A great friend and a very resourceful person, hes helped me innumerable times with last minute jugaad to get an assignment done. When he is not searching wiki to read up something or trying to learn German he is busy playing AOM or debating over some useless topic. Though he has some strange preconceived notions he is quite flexible. He becomes a pro at almost anything he likes and puts his mind too. I will certainly miss those discussions with you. Have a great life ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>Saurav, popularly known as bunty, is more of a brother than a friend to me. He was one of my first friends on campus and undoubtedly the only one who claimed to be a descendant of the sun god ;). Well his great genealogy apart,  the reason our friendship clicked is perhaps that we both, as the cliche goes, are peas of the same pod. Don't get me wrong, we  do disagree on tons of issues (Federer/Nadal, Israel/Palestine..........the list goes on and on) but mostly when i see this "little master" (btw he and Sachin share the same birthday), i see a few inches shorter version of me. He's an incredible guy, a fiercely loyal friend and like me a bit egoistic. He is also an eternal optimist and no matter how low you feel, seeing that childlike innocence on his face will always make you feel better. I wont bore you with his achievements as the list is endless. We all know <saudes> being the /\est AOM player of the campus (he has defeated AI on titan mode, a feat by all means, extraordinary) or him having knowledge of almost anything that is going on in the world. His desire to excel in every field,however, is what makes him special. I will miss all the moments that i spent with him, our long philosophical talks on life, or you reminiscing your childhood events (your experiments with agnosticism still remains one of the best anecdotes i have heard till date), and even our debates for that matter.  To be honest, of all the guys I had the privilege of knowing here at BITS, I'll miss him the most. I wish him all the very best that life has to offer.

<p>Bunty,met him at the carrom table after about a week or so in our first semester and have known him ever since.. we only became thick friends in our 2nd sem n bunkd classes 2gether and regular nite mess outings n endless discussions became the norm.. A slight misunderstanding in our 2-1 only served to strengthen our bond later as is the case generally. An incredibly jovial guy, he is one guy with whom I hv no problem in findin a topic to talk about.. gaming is inborn in him n our fifa n blur sessions only serve as as strong example 4 dis. being in the same branches, v attended classes 2gether (:P), sleepin in the majority og them.. The crux of our group, no doubt, he will be sorely missed and so vil be the times when v used 2 hang out together -> memories i vil cherish thorughout my life :) all the best 4 a bright future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>
<p>I met Bunty while we (Yafis & me) were playing carom, and the little fellow blew our minds by the astonishing intricacies he showed in the movements. It is his subtle intelligence & the sheer stunning sharpness he shows that 

I really did bow down to his intelligence when he told me that he was one of the Super-30 students in Bihar. Man, you are a real testament when it comes to brilliance.
I have the fondest of memories from my 1-1 - the hours and hours we spent discussing random & unbelievably hypothetical situations with Tyagi, Yafis, Balaaji and Sumit.  
Then came the era of laptops in our batch & came the Most Wanted game - NFS Most Wanted. Man, you ruled the game like you do in AOM.
He played TT at an unbelievable level. I remember we playing the game with the TT net down, so that we could fulfill the balls destiny to reach the other side of the table!
Some of the weirdest things I know about him- he remembers the Capitals of all the Countries, you dare not disturb him while he's playing AOM, THE real long debates amongst Yafis, Balaaji & him regarding absolutly useless trivia/politics, customarily beating me at TT, unplayable at Carom & being confident in his own world.

Dude, it was a privilege to have known you. I wish you the best for your future & I hope you fulfill all your dreams in your life!

PS: I know it is not the most boldest or valiant of ways to say - but am truly sorry for the ways I have upset you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
<p>I don't remember when I met him but it has been an awesome experience with him. He is a guy who always gets successful in grabbing people's attention... sometimes because of his skills in carrom and cricket, sometimes because of his godlike gaming, sometimes because of his cute kid like personality and sometimes because of his ULTA T-SHIRT. He is quite knowledgeable and can discuss on almost every topic. I hope his knowledge and hard work will lead him to the peaks of success. All the best bunty.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
