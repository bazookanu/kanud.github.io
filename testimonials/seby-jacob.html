<p>BITS would never be the same without Seby Jacob! The man who was there with me more than half of the time! From being lab partners ( there is no time we did not get the output) for quite sometime now, to playing nite futsal, basketball, badminton, the awesome jam sessions in the music room (Kappa-meen-curry, the about-to-get-famous band we have.. please note people), long nights of talking, hanging out in highly classified locations on campus, the jogging, bird watching, the slo-mo walking, the taxi dance, quick enlightenment to study and the subsequent library sessions (although i just slept there), PS1 memories, vasco trips, the road trips, the outings, sitting in class and just drawing stuff in the notebook, standing in mongi without money (waiting for sum1 hu we know to show up), the pranks and what not.. he was there for everything!! Bloody intelligent, a go-getter, dedicated, hard working,  funny, futsal god, basketball pro, guitar pro and what not?? We also share a common taste in music.. (i usually like his playlists with country music and some acoustic thrown here and there..) and also in being huge fans of SNL!! Thank you man!! Thank you for reminding me to study and do assignments.. or rather for doing my assignements!! Without you I would not have passed EEE or manage labs. And you are the one who inspired me to learn guitar! Apart from all this.. a great mimer too!!! I will never forget the ISRO scene we did together!! Ofcourse i hope to live our dream.. which is living on a countryside after 40.. all f us together! And also wish we could end up together @ work, being EEE mates...!! And also hope our band reaches out to new levels (:P). Really will miss you the next year man!! Wish u the best of luck to reach heights.. (OB u will..)! Always remain same!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charly-poul">Charly Poul</a></p>
<p>Seby( the Canada baby) is one the brightest brains in Bits. He is focused, enthusiastic and in all ways an "All-rounder". A pro footballer, guitarist 9P, a great mime actor, budding basket ball player( Allan chettan be prepared) so goes d list and above all this a good friend. He was the first guy whom i met in this campus and i a happy that we bonded a lot these three yeras. Time spent with seby is always well spent. He teels you all the wierd stories of his school frnds( seby..  u know what i mean) which i cannot say it in public.
The one memory which i will always cherish is the 50 days PS in Klappakam. My PS would have been dull but for this guy. Dinners at Akshaya restaurant(where u get 'snakes' not 'snacks') , Late ni8 movies and ni8 walks, Pondichery trip, MGM "WATER " theme park etc..etc.. Even though we make fun of him( you know how) he always takes it in the right sense and let it go. I always enjoyed discussions and small arguments with him about LOYOLA school and LA-FAEST . He is a perfect blend of responsibility and enjoyment. He helps you in all possible ways and ever dependable. Apart from being a great actor he also contributes through his crazy  innovative ideas. we did many crazy things through out these 3 years and hope will do more crazier things in the coming sem. Hope all our future plans like Banglore bachelor life and 40s country side life comes true..D..1 thing i am sure..for Seby even "sky is not the limit"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>To physically describe Seby:- He is tall, dark, handsome, rugged, well-built, with pate of messy hair on his head. There is not much that he cannot do...he plays the guitar, he is good at all sorts of sports, he is good at mime...and he is good at studies too. He is one heck of a multi-talented personality...for whom nothing is impossible. He has always been a good friend, very jovial and fun-loving. Its difficult to know his true self during the initial interactions...I myself got quite confused, he could be very friendly at one moment and be the exact opposite in the other...but then you realize tht he is just pulling ur leg but his actually very very genuine deep inside. I am glad I met you Seby...its been a pleasure knowing you. You have long way ahead in life!!! Always be the same! All the best Mr Machoman<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/fatima-dilruba">Fatima Dilruba</a></p>

<p>There’s too much to say about Seby. He’s practically good at everything he does. Academics, football, futsal, basketball, mime, fifa, guitar etc. etc. I really don’t know how one person manages to do all of this. It’s been great to have him as a friend. I loved spending time with him because he makes these no sense ‘thara‘ jokes that I really enjoyed:P He and Charlie are like the wrong brothers :PI will never forget his ISRO scene. I still laugh when I think about it XD And both of us share the same interest in football. We did have a lot of rough patches but I always knew he was good at heart and I am glad I could sort it all out with him. We had so many good times. Winning BPL as underdogs in our first year, winning it the next year, PS1, playing football together, playing futsal at night, discussing football, supporting united, doodhsagar, the bogmallo trips etc. etc. Really sad that we have different sem PS. Will miss you. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Seby is one of the most talented guys in campus for sure. He is good or gets good at anything he is into, and manages all his activities responsibly and well enough to get those top grades. Whether it be playing football and basketball, playing guitars or being a mime actor, seby has done it all in his college life. He was also a really great quiz master during his school days :P. Apart from all his talents, he is a real fun guy to hang around with and there is never a dull moment when he is there. Have had lots of fun experiences with him right from the infamous onam dance in the first year, to the football discussions and the afternoon fifa marathons in 2nd year, the jamming sessions, the road trips and bogmalo trips along the way and much more. There will just be too many good memories to take away with once we part. But wait there's still more epic sem left. So in typical mallu style, "Nammukku Porikkande!"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sundar-t-s">Sundar T S</a></p>
<p>Sebyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Has stayed 2 rooms away from me for the past 3 years, yet we havent really interacted as much as one would expect. But I do remember spending these past 3 years being in awe of his limitless talent. Remember myself telling "Seby Jacob can do anything" :P. A multi-talented personality, he is an all-rounder. A very good footballer, an awesome quizzer, excellent at acads, fifa pro, mime club member and a true mallu. Used to top courses with minimum effort, I remember loads of mallus flocking to his room for combined studies (dont think they benefited a lot, but thats a different story :P). Has a unique way of understanding things, but seby, u cant explain shit, very bad at explaining things to others 8-|. We both had the same ps-1, and what an experience that was. Within the 1st week, he worked his magic, and everyone at kalpakkam right from the other students, to our ps instructor, to the IGCAR person-incharge had his name on their lips ( Kanishk and I can take some responsibility for that :P). All of them were in awe of his work, and I am sure the students who go to IGCAR this summer from bits will get to hear tales about his proism from the employees there. And yeah, thanks for lending me your laptop for the useless open-laptop exams the cs faculty members are obsessed with. Owe you one :P. Wish you all the best and always keep in touch. You rock.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-chandramouli">Varun Chandramouli</a></p>
<p>Seby machaa!! funny, friendly, jovial, nerdy and more, this guy is a complete package! A guy who is ready to lend a helping hand anytime. You were there to accompany me in the 'disappearing in the dark' jokes :D Was fun spending all those times with you talking about mallu movie comedies or fagging and drinking in my room or bogmalo :D An avid sports lover, it was fun playing with u all those futsal or badminton games. Even AOE, CS and FIFA we used to play :D Fellow inductees into mime club in 3rd year, I wudnt have been der if u hadnt forced me into coming for the inductions :) It has been an awesome 3 years together. 1 more sem together and after that, all I can say is have fun and keep in touch! :) ATB!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-v-chandran">Aswin V Chandran</a></p>
