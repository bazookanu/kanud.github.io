<h1 class="page-title">Shabbar A  Vejlani</h1><p>It is my honour to be the first one to write testimonial for him. I met him on the first day in common room while playing carrom & soon became my best friend. He is dedicated hard worker who wants to learn everything. A true "EEE God". His dedication towards everything he does is simply praiseworthy and commendable. He has the perseverance and the mental acumen to master anything and everything that he comes across. He is very sincere and has a passion towards learning new things. His success is based on immense hard work and dedication. He is pro in electronics & I am sure no1 in the campus can beat him. He is the most humble person I have ever meet him in life & hopefully will ever meet in future. Apart of from this he also holds many records in the campus. He holds the record of having seen least no. movies after coming to BITS, cumulative least DC download, least no, classes bunked etc.. He is very jovial and never gets angry even if anyone teases him like anything. He is very modest & down to earth.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Shabbar EEE pro! Excellent student and nice person. Apart from all these he is a good friend. I shall miss making fun of him and looking him jump around like a monkey while playing frisbee but not for another semester. :P But seriously this guy always wears a smile and takes every prank very sportively. His hard work and passion in studies is splendid. I won't be surprised with the great success he shall achieve in his life. Good luck buddy!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
<p>Shabbar ! Very humble, Sincere and not to mention his PROness in EEE ! He personifies dedication and perseverance. Apart from the acads, he is a great guy to hang out with ! I was lucky to work with him for IITM and IITK, learnt a lot for him ! I think we first became close in 2-2 when we teamed up for Saastra. And since then its been a wonderful journey. I have never seen him angry. I cherish all gud times that we have had. All the sleepless nights working for the fest, how u were excited in your first flight trip, stay at your place. Hey remember in howrah station, that poor kid would not let you go !:D man, that was soo much fun ! If i get stuck in something, I ll run to him and he would always help me out !. Very jovial guy , always with a smile on his face and likes to talk about electronics ! I m so glad of having known him. And all the best on SAV Solutions ( if i remember right) and i m definietly gonna your client :D !  Its been a hell of a ride with u man ! And no doubt you have a bright future awaiting you ! And dude dont let the corporate world suck u in ! Always stay the SAME ! and stay in touch ! Cheers !

<p>  |||||||||||||||________________ <br />(_______________________) <br />Use one these man. Pretty handy, they turn out to be if used correctly. When coupled with ample foaming semi solid lubricant can efficiently clean your dental belongings & eliminate noxious morning breath. It is also the widest used means the aforesaid purpose. With those out of the way, the years here at Goa have been very memorable, & Kaiko & I have ensured it. But always remember, PANDA is the mastermind. Beneath his mild behaviour is a dark and terrifying sardar waiting to be free. All the times you have been ragged by us will be remembered if not taped. It has been an exhilarating experience playing frisbee in the hostel every now & then and all the times you threw it onto the roof of the common room & how Tripathy would come & spoil it. We have shared many great memories, trips to places, unique experiences and more. Knowing you was fun & we still have a semester to go. I couldn't have asked for better neighbours and our little group is awesome. I am happy that we have always been together and hope that we remain in good contact when we move out. I have always admired your strong concentration towards academics and I respect you for that. You are probably the only person on the campus who tries to see assignments as something more than what others do. That's a bit too sincere of you. You are also the only student here who hasn't acquired the added characteristics of an engineer. We all know you will achieve new heights and I wish you the very best of luck for your goals. Cheers man!!!

<p>Shabbar ( don't really know why we ( rhino, kai, prof ) could not find a name for him ) is a really dedicated, sincere , idealistic, person who is really passionate about electronics ( but prefers to call himself an electronics enthusiast ). He is excellent in academics ( which has helped me a lot in the first two years ) and knows a hell lot of stuff about electronics. He is a person who rarely gets annoyed even though we do tease and troll him a lot in as many ways as one can think of and when he does get annoyed is really easy to reconcile with him). He is someone who values friendship a lot and is always ready to help people out. But even with all this qualities he comes up as a simplistic person who has little knowledge of worldly affairs apart from science and electronics ( of which we have take advantage a lot of times ). Over the past three years we have spent a lot of time together which i am definitely going to miss in future. I wish him luck for whatever he pursues in future and hope to stay in touch after college.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunwar-kanishk-singh">Kunwar Kanishk Singh</a></p>
