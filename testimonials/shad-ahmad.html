<h1 class="page-title">Shad Ahmad</h1><p>He is the bindass banda of campus. I met him in my 1st sem while having "samosas". Since then its been an awesome journey with him. We have studied together and burned the night fuel before exams a lot of times. There is a lot of +ve attitude to take from him. A great person to chat with. I share a lot of common belief about Campus 'girls' with him. He is funny, witty and sometimes gives his very own awesome one-liners..I'll miss the moments spent with you. Wish you best of luck in all your future endeavors..Have a great life...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

<p>Uncle aka Tiger bhai as we lovingly call him is THE DUDE friend of mine.I know him since 1st sem.The fun that we had in the 1st sem rather I should call it as a mission ,going to the library every day for that and returning with the latest info on the target :D is unforgettable and has become a lifelong memory to cherish. Stylish and street smart he knows how to woo the girls :D but that's not it.he is a very good mechie,has been mesa secretary as well as the coordi,is one of the most important and respected members of the aero club and I think he is arguably the best mesa coordinator we have had.He loves flying rc planes and has become very good at it over the years and one of the best flyers on campus.But when it comes to gaming all is forgotten and kept aside,he is a true gaming freak who would go to any length to finish a game once started even if that means screwing an exam next day :P.All the best uncle for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>Shad aka the prince of persia! (he had this insane liking for this game when he came here):P .. one of the first friends I made on campus. I still remember meeting him for the first time and playing uno in his room when i met gujju, jhaad, surya, sachin etc. He has this cool, calm demeanour which I haven't seen him leave even in the most tense of situations we faced together, remember burning the battery in wasi's workshop? He can be found making gliders, quads, helicopters, and other things of his interest in most of his time. His room is more of a museum which houses such relics and antiques which can fly around the campus for you easily doing things like aerial surveillance and other high-tech stuff. When not doing the things like these he can be found trying new ways to burn the graphics cards on his lappy(i tell this because he has succeeded more than once in this) by non stop lan gaming. His charm and ability to woo the subjects of opposite sex almost effortlessly is also a matter of great wonder among us mortals here. :P All that said and done he is one hell of a devotee to the work he does and I think this is going to take him a long way forward in life. Wishing all the very best man, these three years with you will be cherished for life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>
<p>Shad aka Uncle is one of the few people i have met who knows how to get his work done. I admire his advertisement skills which helps him in convincing others in order to get what he wants. We did a lot of chudaap in first sem, those memories i will cherish throughout my life and one of his very good quality is that you will always find him standing beside you in hour of need . He loves to talk and is an indispensable part of our group. I wish him all the best for his future and i know he will do well:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-pathak">HARSHIT PATHAK</a></p>

<p>Shad Ahmad was one of my first friends in college. I met him on a Friday just as both of us were about to go to the mosque for prayers. Call me superstitious, but i always thought that a friendship with such an auspicious beginning had to mean something and mean it did. He has always been there for me, always eager to help in all means possible. I view him as my "motivation guru" coz whenever i felt down or anything like that, i always knew the place where i could get my spirits high AH4-134. He simply oozes optimism and confidence which always made you feel better, no matter what.  He is a total mech geek, not so much in the academic part but totally /\ in aerodynamics and engineering design. I will never forget all the talks that we had regarding life, boxing and what not and I wish him the very best that life has to offer.
