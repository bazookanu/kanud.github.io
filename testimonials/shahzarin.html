<p>Shahzarin! I remember knowing you  since our big break when we danced together and how   you bid me farewell as i was gonna leave for Mesra(:P).I shall always  remember envying you for what i call an awe-inspiring figure :P. It was great fun doing ads and sales together sitting in library discussing it when almost all other batch mates had left the campus.Video shooting part was an experience too. You are one of the those people who will always stay a friend even though we meet less.Wishing you a bright future! :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>
<p>Shahzarin! I remember meeting her in the library for the first time, when were dealing with es1 . Always studying this girl :P. Then we got to spend quality time together during abhigyaan classes. What fun it was!  She is  really dedicated and hardworking. And an awesome person to talk to. Her animated way of conversation really awes me!! 
Glad to know you!!..n yeah. we have one more year !! :D all the best! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita">Ishita</a></p>
<p>Though I do not talk to her that often, when I talk it feels like I am talking to someone already I know. Maybe because of the common friend and the fact that we started learning guitar at the same time. The conversations we have on these common topics and other random stuff have been fun. Looking forward to next year and hoping to know you better :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-yegnamurthy">Neha Yegnamurthy</a></p>
