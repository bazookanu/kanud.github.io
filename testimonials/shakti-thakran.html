<h1 class="page-title">Shakti Thakran</h1><p>awesomest dude i ever met,  a great friend, a genius by mind, a genius in computers and gaming, but most importantly a genius by heart.  May that be discussing girls, bitching about others, doing evil stuff, proclaiming any random guy our mighty God(and of course changing him as often as we change our clothes) or may that be buying loads of stuff off the internet, Shakti's the guy..
all these years spent with you were as crazy and as awesome as they could ever be
all the best for your future man, fodd diyo!

<p>Shakti aka tharkan
Abey tu din bhar room pe karta kya he? 
He is a very reserved person doesn’t speak much but like to observe things and have fun though never leaves a chance to insult baba :D . He has a lot of potential but never utilises it. A gadget geek from whom we take advice before buying anything. He was little late in enjoying the engg.life but when he did—HE WAS A JOGGER (only club people will understand this).
Shakti you have been a saviour during nite outs with the KRACK JACK u always have with you. You have been like a night borkar for me :D. Its been fantastic three years with you and hope to add many more. Cheers!
PS: Plz change the biscuit, I don’t like KRACK-JACK much.

<p>The tech geek who is responsible for more than 50% of gadgets in our group including my laptop :) He is also the gaming god and had prob tried each and every game possible including some really weird ones too. He is a simple, down to earth and practical guy who likes to listen to everyone and possesses a tremendous potential to achieve anything. He has been a great frnd and helping hand for all these years. I still remember the day when he became a “pro jogger” and “our wish became his command” ( I hope even u remember ). Well, I wish him a great and awesome career ahead………….. and stay connected aur life njoy kario !!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>
<p>Met at the vasco station on the 1st day of my BITS life, shared cab to the campus and got adjacent rooms....this is how our journey started and I am so glad that we ended up being neighbours :)  It did not take long for me to realize that Shakti was a complete gadget freak!!! He just loved all of them and was always excited to check the latest one in the market. These 3 years of my BITS life would have been so boring had it not been for Shakti who always gave me a hearty laughter by his talks. I have some of the best memories of you, me and Ladda doing random stuff, making Bhel, playing 'pocket tanks' n 'motocross madness' and watching movies together. He was actually like a Tech newspaper for me informing me about all the new technology that came up  and clarifying my noob PC related issues with which i always bugged him.  He also learnt quite a few terms in Marathi like 'Abe ob e be' and it was really funny when he spoke Marathi in front of us. Studying together with this guy was the best thing......half of the time we would talk about random stuff or compose songs on Ladda .....and this really helped me score ,becoz in a way it helped me de-stress just before the exam. We also acted like alarms for each other during the exam times.....asking each other to check after every 1/2 n hour in the night to see if we were still awake! I still remember the horrible juice or syrup (whatever it was) that Ladda made you purchase and take home......you told me that it was so horrible that  your maid used it to clean the floor ;)  But I hope you still remember the 'paan' I got for you from home.....I hope that wasn't that bad :P I can't help writing the various plans we used to make to irritate Ladda....like the one in which we started making 'rat' noises, becoz Ladda was very afraid of rats.....like the one when we used to lock Ladda in his room......like the one we used to talk loudly purposely when Ladda was asleep to wake him up.......like  the Triple-H style water spray on his door.....and hundreds of other that i can't even remember. And what to say about your clock which was always 1/2 hour ahead and Ladda every time used to see it and get a mild heart-attack ;) All these memories will always stay with me whenever I am reminded of my BITS life......you are the beshhhhtestt neighbour anyone could get......I hope you again land up as my neighbour after your PS. Wish you all the best bro! Keep rocking :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Shakti Thakran ,one of the closest chu friends I have made in this campus. Saala pura chu hain .But has been a guy to turn to whenever you need anything. Always remains cool no matter whats the occasion. Got to know that he had phodufied JEE before coming to BITS. Its only proves my argument that no matter what your CG there is a geek and a phodu inside everyone here. The TV series es we watch, the movies , being Titan admins are a few things we have in common and which has made our bond stronger. Hopefully we will end up in Bangalore or something and remain friends after BITS too. Cheers to our friendship. Have a great life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
