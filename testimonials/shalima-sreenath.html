<h1 class="page-title">Shalima Sreenath</h1><p>One of the sweetest persons I have met. She is gentle, understanding and caring. Somebody who is also very hardoworking and dedicated, whether it came to studies or dancing. PS-1 wouldn’t have been the same without you, Shalima! I remember how formal we were when we met for the first time and look at us now!! Some moments at PS-1 are unforgettable. I remember how I used to make fun of your Hindi ( calling Bhaiya ..Baiyya) , you teaching me Malyalam ( I couldn’t even repeat after you!),  getting irritated at my alarm ( :D ), the time we were chased by an ox, the movies we watched in different languages, the Keralite restaurant and all the secrets we shared!! ( :D). Wish you loads of luck for future…love you loads!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>
<p>One of the sweetest and most genuine person I have ever met...Shalima Sreenath is the best example of divine beauty with brains, extremely talented...no one can match her when she performs on stage...be it Bharatnatyam....Mohiniattam...or even Kathak ( Now that you mastered tht too!!! ) She rarely opens up to people..a bit of an introvert....but once she gets to know you well....its difficult to keep her mouth shut!!! Will always cherish the beautiful moments we spend together, all the talks that we had, all the secrets that we shared..Our endless discussions on food.. men :P...Onam Celeberations....the numerous trips...all the photo sessions!!!....we have had our ups and downs ...but I am glad we overcame them all...and not let them affect our friendship!!! 
So Shalu!!! Alwys be the same warm, sensitive person that you are!!! I am sure you have a long way to go in life!!! And do remember me...once in a while...wherever you are!!!! It was a pleasure to have known you!!! All the best for all your future endeavours!!! :-**

<p>Shalima is the most fun person I know in campus. Beautiful, vibrant, smart, charming, soft spoken.. I could go on and on about her. A great friend, understanding and warm-hearted, someone you can always count on. She is an ardent lover of classical music and dance. She is an awesome Veena player and a very talented dancer. She is hardworking and dedicated to the art form. Kudos for all those mind blowing performances.I have had an amazing time with her the last three years.. all the gossips, inside jokes, non-stop talking for hours and hours ,combined studies, laughing till it hurts your cheeks, small small fights, late night maggi making, our  outings, watching ridiculous telugu movies, our even more ridiculous plans and stories we cook up (btw I’m still thinking about the t.v. series plan). If it weren’t for you my campus life wouldn’t have been this interesting and eventful. Love you a lot!!. I know we will always be friends but I will miss seeing you everyday. I had a wonderful time with you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jyothsna-k-unnikrishnan">Jyothsna K Unnikrishnan</a></p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Shalima is her radiant smile. It just never fails to bring a smile to you face. In my first year I always felt lucky to have her in my same CG range. But in her 2nd year she decided to start living in the library :P She's a great dancer and also an amazing person to hangout with. Had so much fun fooling around especially during last wave :D She's also the only person who I asked out for prom XD Wishing her all the best. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>

She not only excels at academics but also is an immensely talented dancer. She is hardworking, soft spoken , and a person who always brings a smile on your face. I wish you all the best for your future endeavours! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
<p>Shalima-d person who always has a smile ready by the time each of her sentences end- A fellow A1 student- We had great tym poking fun at "some" Chemical Faculty or other-thanks to her observant nature :P :P She is one the few people whose frequency resonates wd myn (d other being Srishti) and so we can get along well when it comes to studies.... She is a talented Classical Dancer.... She is extremely humble and never shows off... (U wouldnt knw she travelled all over Europe and is good at acads and extra-curriculars unless you tried really hard) ..her room is always welcoming wd the smell of agarbatti... May you forever remain the calm and sincere person you are.. D best to you...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>

<p>A very sweet and extremely hard-working girl, a great dancer and above all a wonderful person. It’s always good talking to her. I enjoyed her company in the Chemical classes and also in the project we did (I wish we could have done the next semester project together as well). Stay the way you are and always keep smiling :). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>

<p>Shalima. One of the first few chemical girls I met. She is a really great classical dancer. Didn’t know that until their Onam dance practice in hostel. Her expressions are very communicative. She has very different voice. Loud at times, and very soft at other times (eg. while giving attendance :P her ‘yes sir’ hardly reaches the teacher I guess) My almost neighbour (:P) but we mostly met n interacted in classes (except for pre-exam doubts or paper discussion :P) She was there in PS1 with me in Chennai.. It used to be nice (though sad) to listen to your MMM hostel issues... :P We will meet next sem.. so see you soon :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
