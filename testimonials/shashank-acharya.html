<p>A True Mechanical Engineer, Physics Genius, CFD pro-Shashank is one of the most intelligent persons I have ever met. Fodu Tope _/\_: the door of his room rightly says :). He has aced all his CDC courses. He is very hardworking and helping. He is always fun to be around with his spontaneous Hyderabadi Hindi one liners and jokes. He speaks Hyderabadi hindi just like the characters in the movie Angrez. He speaks Marathi too. We have always had a lot of discussions and brainstorming related to mechanical engineering . He has amazing conceptual clarity and logical thinking abilities. He is always equipped with high tech gadgets i pods,i pad,etc. You give him any electronic gadget and he deciphers the intricacies and high tech apps within no time. He has mastered one of the toughest subjects of mechanical engineering-fluid mechanics. I am glad to have a friend like him! I wish you all the best for your future! Don't ever change, always be the way you are!   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>Shashank Ansys Acharya, loves legs and wishes he was stoned.
Jokes apart, Tope is one of the finest friends of my life. His eccentricities, our common love for Hyderabadi  Hindi,  his misanthropy, everything makes him unique and unforgettable. We’ll surely miss going into his room any minute of the day to see him sitting lazily, and going –“This is randaap!” I still remember my first days of EG, sitting next to him and asking him a million doubts to find the next day he lives 3 doors down. We’ve spent countless days discussing technology, science, TV Shows, films. His love for all things tech is unmatched to anyone. Music, gaming,Engadget, George Harrison, good internet,’mekenikal engineering’, the IPad are his forte. I don’t think I’ve found someone with these many shared  interests as mine and the same level of enthusiasm for them.  I’ve really come to respect and appreciate Tope as a great friend and confidante.  In the course of three years, he’s come to define a few words for us, mainly introvertish, social-awkwardness, homophobia, geek, and friend. We’ll miss his OCD for getting the exact wallpaper size, yet leaving the room key inside an overturned old shoe, his daily struggle  at maintaining his #1 Coke fan position, not pronouncing ‘sex’ and a whole lotta things. I’ve had some great memories with Tope - mostly christening him Tope  :D, watching Supernatural/ Game of Thrones, then dissecting every scene in detail, his love for short forms and the ‘chu’ term, Bogmalo, Velinos’ and many more. It’s been a pleasure knowing this guy, and I hope to sit at Café Del Mar with him some day, sipping Heineken, and trying to ignore the foreigner groupies at his side.

<p>Shank Kraft...though I got to know him well only last sem we've ended up conversing a lot in Mech classes. To be honest, I guess I hadnt seen you till the second year although we stay on the same floor. Shank has got to be one of the most devout followers of Ansys on campus and has had a new found love of acads (to many people's dismay). An asli nerd with expensive gadgetry to boast, it been fun being around Shank especially when he starts talking about his COP and the latest simulations he has done. Way to go, and hope we see you as the CEO of Ansys sometime in the future!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>When I came to know of him first, it was because of his Physics 1 reputation. My first discussion with him (rather, he was talking with someone else) consisted mainly of computers, laptops, manufacturing units in China, little tricks by laptop manufacturing companies. It came as a shock to me when I found out he was A4. Shashank is the Swami of the Mech softwares. I havent seen such dedication and grasping powers elsewhere. Talking with him is always an entertaining experience, especially with his Hyderabadi-Hindi-English.His simple answers to simple questions always amuse you. Shashank lives,eats, and swims in music and technology.He shares my love for George Harrison.Imagining Shashank without any of his pro-tech gadgets is really hard.He is THE super-pro banda. Once we were in his room watching some show, which had a beautiful lady in it. We had eyes (understandably) only for the lady, and this guy says-"Look, she has an iPhone bey!"....He also drinks more coke than anyone else!! A truly unique person, is Shashank! We know you are going to be a swell Mech engineer. All the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Tope is carved from a different stone altogether. His wit, spontaneity and social awkwardness is a deadly combination. His ability to come up with the most brilliant of comparisons leaves everyone in splits. He is truly one of the best and most honest human beings i have met in my life. His child like curiosity and his down-to-earth attitude is something to be admired. Tope's time for "Randaaap" will be something that will always bring a smile to my face. I've had some of the most intellectually stimulating to the most obscure of conversations with this guy and those are conversations i will never forget. Be his "checking out the bitcheez" podcast song or his hip-hop-dawg shirt, Tope's a charmer. He's a real top notch guy and he's going to go very, very far in life(Space even...:P)  Remember my 1% deal when you get rich and build a hotel in Vegas! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>Every quintessential movie/anecdote about college life that has ever been always has that one special character – one who stands out for his uniqueness, his strikingly different qualities and his integrity to stick to them, despite what social norms dictate. These are the ones who usually make it big, whom their few friends associate their fondest college memories with and the ones who make for the most special of friends. Crazy Diamonds, I like to call them (Yes, I know I’m not very original). For my college life, Shashank has been that one person. Tope, as I came to know him (No, seriously, For the first 2 months, after we became friends, I still didn’t know his first name and was too embarrassed to ask. Finally, I read it off his Thermo textbook), has to be one of the most unique characters I’ve ever come across. A fellow 2-D guy and a true, dedicated mechanical engineer and a solid genius. I first met him in Physics-I class, laboring under the misconception of a teacher that was RSP. My first memory of him is him correcting a proof RSP had gone horribly wrong in, within a few minutes. I remember being very envious of his command over basics & concepts. Till today, I am actively jealous of his solid theoretical background in his subjects and his ability to apply that knowledge in practical problems – a manner of structures learning I was always advised to yet never manage to follow. His thirst for knowledge is unquenchable and he’s one person who effectively utilizes the true power of the internet for learning. Tope is responsible for more than half of my knowledge of the Internet and that’s more than enough reason for me be in touch with him and be his friend forever – which is gonna be uphill to say the least, given his love for dwellings. Given the location of his room, its tradition for me to go and trouble him after every meal – which has led to him christening me with a plethora of names: Rat bastard, Churod, V-Man – the power of the universe, to name a few. We share a common love for the Beatles (I’ve still heard more songs than you) and random house music – he’s one person I can have long discussions about music with while he’s studying. To sum it all up, Shashank is easily one of my favorite people on this campus and one I’m gonna really miss hanging out with. I don’t know what I’m going to miss more – his innumerable eccentricities, or his misanthropy, or his general anxiety, or his precocious curiosity, or his iPad, or his Alienware, or his love for Coke and its documentaries, or his love for legs, or his sermons to me about the goings-on in the commercial tech world, or his Hyderabadi Hindi, or his epic analogies, or his super-epic drunk state or just his trademark sigh of exasperation, “This is toh randaap, re bhai.” I know I’ve gone on too long, but then so had Floyd with their tribute in “Shine On…” Cheers, Tope! Keep checking out the bitcheeez…<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Shashank! One of my most favourite people on campus, and possibly, in the world. He has been the best neighbour one could have asked for. We first met right in the first week of campus, when he subtly made it clear that since I wasn't a mechanical student I wasn't good enough to know him :P. The next i saw of him, despite living right next door, was a month or so later, and since then the journey has been insane! RSP's physics classes would've been incomplete without Tope sitting right at the back, playing snake on his Nokia 1100, and pointing out RSP's errors whenever he looked up. I also remember the first time Tope, Praveen (Oak) and I sat in the wrong bus in Vasco and landed up on San Jacinto, before which we had landed a steal of a deal for some epic earphones as well. We've been looking for those ever since, and 
just like the Holy Grail, those earphones elude us. One hell of a trip that was!  We've shared a common love for all kinds of music, and Shashank is always ready to try anything i suggest, even the Manipal song that makes ears bleed. Be the change it seems. Anyways, I think my greatest feat that involves Tope was to convince him to play the role of K.Almadi in our POM skit (how we hated POM and gyanesh :| ), and boy did he slay that and how! Knowing him, i think that's one of the craziest things I've seen him do yet. Everybody's written about how Shashank is such a sharp person, how he's a CFD stud, pro-gamer (I remember whipping his ass at COD: Modern Warfare multiplayer once :P ), insanely spontaneous, one liner-king, a sucker for slapstick comedies such as It's always Sunny in Philadelphia, fellow Cosmo Kramer worshipper, know-it-all when it comes to technology and the list is endless, but  he's also one of my best friends on campus, and needless to say i shall miss his idiosyncrasies very much. I shall also miss just lying in his room for countless number of hours discussing anything and everything, trying to come up with the perfect murder (:P ), laughing at Batman bin Suparman and gazillions of other pointless things, and of course drinking water from his bottle. All our Bogmalo nights, random trips to random places, and birthday parties would never have been the same without him. Tope's got a bright-ass future ahead, and i am very sure he's going to achieve all that he wants. Here's to lifetime of friendship and a lifetime of stalking Tyral Bipath! Cheers! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
