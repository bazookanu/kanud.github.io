title: SHASHI BHUSHAN
---
<h1 class="page-title">SHASHI BHUSHAN</h1><p>Sunil Bhaiya (our hostel assistant) unlocks my room on the first day and asks me for my native. Then he says, “upar me bhi to hai ek patna se”.  I went to that room, there was whole family without any boy of my age. And then uncle started talking to me and after good 15 minutes or so, I ask him,”where is  shashi?” Uncle points to a boy who looks merely class 9 student.  He has enormous potential. He started from zero and went on to be the part of hostel  Table tennis team within 4 months. His drive for college team t shirt made him carom champion :P One thing about close friend is that you don’t know where to stop. I can go on and write about numerous train journey, mongi sittings, his love for guitar and his mischievous plans of buying electric guitar. 
I will wait for his solo album. (btw he also sings well)

<p>well.... we instantly became good friends for obvious reasons......we would be awake till late night...doing almost anything but study....bunking lectures....While others were busy struggling for A and B, we had our own fight...escaping the fate of E.... and trust me...Shashi has mastered the art!!!

I distinctly remember the nite before Thermo compre....v managed laptops from our seniors....and spent the whole night playing CS...it was awesome!!
One of his best quality is that he is very dedicated to what he loves to do....Once he sets his mind over something, he'l not leave until he becomes a master of it...... table tennis, carrom and guitar is it's testimony....
he is also one of the most regular guy i have ever come across.....those who know him must have understood that i am talking about mongi.... :P
1 thing that I'l regret..... that I never got to know the mystery of N.......  :(
.....Undoubtedly he is one of my closest friend....
I can't say that I'l miss this and that without you....coz there is hardly anything in the campus that I have done without you.... you were with me in everything....
Any mongi and NC trip is incomplete without you.....
Thanks for making all those train journeys memorable....
well this is definitely not the farewell for us....b'coz u are not gonna get rid of me so soon......


friends like you make it all the more harder to leave the campus  :'(  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nawaz-nasar">Nawaz Nasar</a></p>
<p>Shashi is a very simple and friendly guy. He can make friends with anybody within minutes of meeting, maybe because of his cute way speaking and his weird phati laughter. He is very passionate about the things he likes (and yes attending lectures are not among them) for example his love of guitar and playing carom. Plays the guitar very well because i thought him how to :P and yeah i'll miss his "saste" jokes and the time we spent in the labs. I wish him the best in whatever he does. Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>Shashi !! Nah.. I prefer calling you rabbit !! ;) One of the cuties I have ever encountered in my life ! I don't remember how exactly we became friends but that was indeed quick :P I would be always be thanking God for that !! One of my best lab buddies !! You are a perfect entertainer with your excellent comic timing and carefree attitude !! You are always ready to extend a helping hand..!! I have enjoyed so much during the ecology assignment we had together..each and every part of it was hilarious..be it the endless photo sessions of all of us instead of what was required or raghav's stupid comments!! :D I like the way you take everything "lite" because I do that too.. :P You never itched when I used to call you rabbit..:P 
Though I think that's a compliment :\ and an insult to rabbit :P :D !! You are a very genuine person who is extremely good at heart !  You have this excellent quality of respecting friendship and being a true friend, imbibed in you !! :D One thing that's still comes to me as a bizzare is that you know me so well !!! Although I hate it when you say "awwww" in that stupid/irritating tone of yours...ewww... !! :P Hehe.. :P And one more thing !! Good music taste.. :) I enjoy the songs you keep on sending me.. :D Haan one advice.. thodi classes attend kar liya kar yar.. :P ;) Anyways.. I wish you all the very besshsht for a bright future ahead (*rabbit* :P )!! :D Cheers !! :D

<p>First thing i noticed  about shashi is he is a damn quick learner ( i’m not  talking about studies here :P ). He is one of the best friend of mine since starting of 3rd year. i will thank vijayshree mam for that ( :P).our journey started with a project (not exactly project ,BITS named it so :P ) then we got a reason to hangout after that we didn’t need any reason .we took an COP this semester some naughty reason (u know ryt :P)  .we used study before the exam night  both don’t know anything in bio but still we managed them  i really enjoyed those combined studies.
He has a great taste in MUSIC . he is very good at playing GUITAR  and he really loves playing it .i ‘ve seen him playing guitar without going to mess ( did i ? :P ).he taught me some strings but i never got them ( i  played  my own strings :P) . he plays table tennis and he is also in our collage carom team . he learnt all those stuff in very short time. He is very helpful and he has very good sense of humour of his own type .whenever i feel like lonely and bored i used to go his room and we had continues endless chat on different topics .all the bio labs and projects are not that much interesting without u  .  I will miss u in next year very much no project,no common hostel :(....i hope u will achieve great heights  in life ...i  will definitely attend ur concert  i have that confidence :)  .

<p>My partner in crime shashi bhai has what it takes to bear a extreme guy like me...having known him since my 1st day  :P shashi has always been a saviour for me....despite of getting single digit marks my mind was always relieved when i remembered that “shashi hai na”......log kahte hai shashi isn’t game for studies........lekin mein nahi manta.......pichle sabhi sem mein D’s ki lari lagan eke baad.... log kahte hai shashi ko D se lagav hai.....lekin mein nahi manta.... usse toh sirf DD se lagav hai......... Log kahte hai guitar aur bihar poles apart...lekin mein yeh nahi manta....pichle 2 sem mein shashi ne guitar aisa sikh liya hai ki (not to forget his melodic vocals) Mere jaise kai hendrixs ko inspire kiya hai isne......log kahte hai padhai kilaasroom mein bahuut badhiya koti hai...hum nahi mante.....hume toh mante hai ki padhai shadhai toh sirf shashi ke room pe hoti hai.....countess nights i have spent with him in his room during exams and shashi ka room ((filled with me him chintan,  sinha sir, jammi n disturbers (nawaz n prathemesh)) has been stuff of legends and every ah5 guys knows it...the real genuine guy he has saved my ass n asses of countless guys like me millions of times(no doubt he loves asses :P)......exams ki dikkat ho ya feeling lonely , ghar ki yaad aaye yaa guitar kharab ho jaye, jeb mein paisa na ho ya dil ka dard bardasht nahi kiya jaye he has solved almost every problem i have ever had....log kahte the shashi ko gussa jaldi aata hai...mein nahi manta...bombarded him everyday with my sick n annoying habits for the last 3 yrs lekin aaj tak kabhi mujhe apne se alag nahi kiya (haan galiyon ki dose zaroor time to time milti rahti hai).....the guy with the golden heart dost ban kar mila tha lekin jana toh pata chala ki bhai se kam nahi...tabhi toh we don’t call him shashi but shashi baiya in short  “shashiya” (though ‘rabbit’ wud also do)......bitiya jindabaad!!!! CG murdabaad!!!!
