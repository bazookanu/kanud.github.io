<p>Shaurya is one of the most vibrant and jolly persons you’ll ever meet..........a clear headed person and an insatiable hunger is how i would describe him :P..........i simply love the passion with which he eats and describes various food items......his organizing skills are simply brilliant..... if you leave the details of a ‘party’ to Shaurya, you can be rest assured that you are going to have a wonderful time........... he has a vast knowledge of many things.....and there is always something that you learn can learn from him.......he’s someone who is always morally and ethically right..........he is damn focussed and knows what he has to do........keep on eating tonnes :P..........and be just the way you are......all the best for your future!!!!!!!!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-verenkar">Akshay Verenkar</a></p>
<p>bhaaaari, Well, one of the very first friend of mine on campus. The first 2 sems were really great with most of our sections being the same and we enjoying a good time together. And then our frequent trips to IC for dinner. Man, it was you who got me going with the food and now i see myself 20 kgs + of what i was in the first year. But then they were all great times. The first movie i watched on the campus in your room, "The knowing". and then that usual "wake me up in the morning" notes that we used to leave at night to each other. Well you were always the one to get up first and wake me and anuj too. All those masti and fun that we have had is finally coming to an end. But it was just great knowing you and lived a room away from your for these three years. Wish you all the best for you future mate which i know is very bright. Just be what you are and you will never have a prblm with anything. All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Shaurya achieved the perfect balance between nerdism and partyism. I guess he's the most chilled out nerd you can find and truly parties as hard as he studies. Technically speaking I knew him since School days, but I truly got to know him here in College. I had an amazing time with him and Sagar, especially at the beach shacks, whether that be in Bogmalo or anywhere else in Goa. I wish I had known him better during School as well. He is also one of the most food-a-holic people I've ever met. His passion for good food almost matches his passion to Ace every test he gives in BITS (which is exactly what he did). Apart from all this, Shaurya is also awesome at Tennis and his talent in the sport has grown ever since he came to campus. It'll be hard to not have you around anymore. I'll surely miss all the times we spent together here in Goa. I hope we meet soon and may our paths cross soon again in the future.
Best of luck for the future, and may you ace everything that comes your way, pretty much how you've been doing till now :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
