title: Shishir Salvatore
---
<h1 class="page-title">Shishir Salvatore</h1><p>His persona conjures up many images in my mind. In the beginning he was just another random guy in E&I, but then mid-way through his 2nd sem a strange metamorphosis transformed him into a cool dude, a poet who can dole out wonderful pieces and a great friend whom you can always trust with anything. Intellectually too he sure can impress you with stuff others just contemplate about achieving (2 projects under Singru, Rockwell Internship :D). On a personal note this poet is The Inspiration behind the tad bit of poetry that I write occasionally. Wish him all the very best for his oh-so-bright future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>The dood of the campus. A very good person at heart. Always ready to help anyone. Totally harmless to all living beings :P. A truthful & a simple person. He is very, very hard working & always gets things done in advance, never waits for the last moments. Had awesome years with him here. He's really a great friend.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>He was my first friend on campus,and I liked his company from that first trip to vasco.Hes a genuine individual,who is always ready to help out someone in need..His fun loving nature is something that everyone around him enjoys..His dedication to pushing forward in life is something thats really great in him..Be it jogging or flirting,he sure is dedicated towards what he wants..He may not come across as a EnI nerd,but he sure has his share of awesome technical projects and more! I really admire his inner strength,which burns bright inspite of the world.Dont change,Shane! ..Wish life takes you some place great..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
<p>hes irritating but fun! real fun! his company guarantees it! :)
one of the first few guys i met in the campus, have to admit, he was the most relaxed and amiable amongst the group (though it changed later, for the good :P ) still remember how we borrowed his laptop in the first sem and watched Death Race and Johnny Gaddar! :D       
large and warm hearted, i have shared countless laughs with him till he got married (not once, twice :P )  
the best part about him is his dedication,(be it his project, or jogging daily );  ek baar jo commitment kar diya, uske baad apni bhains ki bhi nai sunta!
will always cherish the beach trips with him. and the fun we had reading his poetry! (never intended to hurt you :) )

<p>His name conjures up images of a Spanish conquistador, cutting heads of dissenters on a guillotine, blood spilling out from their pulsing aorta, while they wretch in agony in the last few living moments...but he's pretty much the opposite. Shishir won't hurt a mosquito, even if it's those slow moving ones who've already sucked a lot of your blood and are just so appealing to swat. Anyway, too much blood for this post. I won't forget Shishir's poetry attempts (I never understood them), and his fancy sepia toned profile pics, in every imaginable pose. And despite all the fun we poked sometimes, he'd always take them good-naturedly. And as Pritz said, he really is large(both figuratively and literally) and warm hearted. He's been working on some pretty good stuff on his own, like MEMS and PLC's. His dedication is admirable. Once he sets to do something, he pretty much nails it. Wish you best of luck for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>

<p>Shishir Shane Salvatore, a person as cool as his name. He was one of my first friends on campus. Our early days on campus was fueled by movies played on his laptop. From those days to now, when one can at-most catch a glimpse of him near the mess, he has matured a lot. I will always admire the single minded determination he had towards early morning jogs (a practice which I attempted in his company but failed). It is the same will power that has powered him through 2 semesters of projects in MEMS. He dares to take the path less trodden, and it has bore fruits for him. 
I have had some very memorable times with him in our small trips. Though a road trip is still pending...A fun loving, cheerful person to hang around with. All the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
<p>shishir is dude, the. him and his proverbial 'lite lo yaar' have helped me kill many an anxious moments. this guy doesn't throw a lot of jargon your way, he wont complicate things for you, no. not that he cant, just that he doesn't need them to make his point.  kudos to him, for that. shishir knows what he wants, which may/not be unorthodox and he will go after after it. poetry, sports, academics you name it, shishir has it. one piping hot potpourri!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>
<p>Shishir aka @ustin_Powder :D Great friend !! Our good friendship started off in 1-2 with a simple dc chat , then gtalk and then I met him in person.  He is a fun person to talk to. I love his poetry ... and he has got great literary skills. He is a man of determination . He still stands as an  inspiration to many people who want to reduce their weight and this guy has showed it to the world by his case that" Nothing is Impossible when you have the Passion and Determination to do something." All the best for a wonderful Life Shishir :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>SHANE!! This guy is my role model. Amazing speed with which he lost weight.... OMG!! Now this dude from bihar is 'the' ladies man, with great looks, stylish persona, mushy poems and humble personality. This guy has given me so many pep talks on how to lose weight, how to approach chicks..... sadly I never took any advice seriously :( A corridor-mate he has been with me for 3 years and made them truly unforgettable with some epic discussions on philosophical matters. A true friend, he always has your back and is pure from heart. A sporting person, he seeks the inner you in the person and in very impartial. It had been a pleasure spending 3 years with you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Shishir, a name which I had only seen on facebook until I came into my second year....that was when I actually met him and our friendship has grown since then. He is a great person at heart, a great guy to talk to and most importantly someone who will listen very patiently to what you have to say (even if your temper has reached its height and  u end up shouting at him he will never retaliate back but instead keep his calm).... he is a very mature guy....such people are rare to come by in this campus I feel....Shishir is an amazing writer and I totally admire his writing talent....We have had our share of fights and discussions on random topics which have many a times irritated me to the point of having me lose my temper but even then I consider him as a true friend....He will readily give his opinions if u ever need them and quite often they are genuine....He is a total fun loving person and loves to go out and do masti with friends very often....So to conclude in a nutshell...Shishir Shane Salvatore you have been a wonderful friend of mine over the past two years. I must say I had a great experience working with you for Sizzling Sands which somehow never saw the light of the day but I know you had put your heart and soul into it. I will always miss the way u pulled my leg given a chance and all the random conversations we had....I sincerely hope that you get what you want in life. Always stay the same person you are. I hope that we shall be able to keep in touch even after we pass out irrespective of where we are. Good luck to you and Cheers to our friendship!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Our own Sha(a)ne! Yeah, the nick suits him quite well! :P
If there's one guy who's attitude is better than anyone else's, that's Shane! It makes you look at the idea of 'li8' from a totally different perspective! Friendly, kind and open-hearted. He takes criticisms and applause the same way - one thing that I've been trying to learn from him, but never really did! We've cracked jokes on each other, laughed our hearts out on them and yes, the staircase discussions invariably turn out to be the most entertaining of them all! The kind of interest that both of us show in trying out something creative made us better friends! :)
Once I believed that writing poems was probably not my cup of tea and then he painted a whole new picture and told me that it is all about putting in words, what you think or feel....... and more often than not, a way of clearing up the payload of emotions n cloudy tho8s within!!  It all sounded so simple.......... and then we turned out to be bros on FB commenting on each other's poems! :D
I owe you a big thanks for that!
We've shared some good memories indeed! Be the way you are - only get better if you may! :)
All the best! Stay in touch! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>

<p>31 July 2009, It was a rainy day ,i was standing in queue for hostel allotment near SAC. i couldn't believe at first , it was Shishir , my immediate neighbor from  home city.  Determined , smart and hardworking, he is calm composed , composite and makes for a true friend.he is very helpful and caring and will always motivate me whenever i was low. the ultimate jugaadu also knows how to cast his spell on girls, (u have done it number of times :P ). A library keeda from 3rd year knows very well his aim and always strive for it. And when it comes to dedication, shishir is the name, the transformation in him from 1st year to 3rd year will qualify as a miracle. A very mature person with cool head and charisma will surely get whatever he aims in life. All the best !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurav-kumar">Saurav kumar</a></p>
<p>Hmm…kya boloon?? Sab kuch to baaki sab ne keh diya…smart, stud, genuine, (harmless :P :P) etc etc. I am in awe of his so many qualities, his determination, (which sadly I still haven’t learnt from u), his awesome poetry, his mature way to handle the worse of situations, how he rarely ever loses his temper (how the hell do u manage that?? I almost always end up shouting when I’m pissed!!)….all are so admirable… he will always vouch for gender equality, par khana banane ko koi kahega to bolega, “mujhe seekh kar kya karna hai??” :P :P. And he always wakes up so early, even on holidays!! (yaar, Sunday 9 baje tak sona is perfectly normal  :P ). One thing to clarify which is a misconception with a lot of ppl (i.e. girls), when he talks to u politely, doesn’t mean he is flirting wid u!! (:P :P) Mujhe bhi baad mein hi pata chala.. ;) It’s just that he doesn’t know how not to give a damn to someone else’s problems…(really thoughtful, isn’t he??) All in all, shishir is a friend really lucky ones get… U hav to keep in touch wid me..vo to ob hi hai…bt the most important thing is…..DONT grow a moustache again….u look much better without it… :P :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-aggarwal">Megha Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>shishir Salvatore a.k.a shane 
Have known shishir since the day i sold him a club shirt when no1 else was ready in my 1st yr.....and from that time our friendship has blossomed like anything....married twice shishir still manages to keep up with all the commitments he made for us...the dude with the golden chuckle is a perfect blend of brains and browns n thats what makes him so cooool (that he gets all the chicks...)
Jokes apart shane is very genuine person who really loves his buddies and accepts them as they are...bogmalo before exams ho ya lake pe jogging ka plan u can always count on him to execute any impossible plans..... a firm decision maker knows himself well and has a very clear focussed plan in life...very grounded by nature shishir is effortlessly multitalented has some really worthy accomplishments ranging from acads(yeah yeah some really cool cop’s n internships) to physical fitness (reduced 20 kgs in impossibly small time) to interpersonal relationships (has maintained LDR with so many gals  :P) to learning the acoustic  while maintaining a superb room (condition of his water bottle is stuff of legends...) Salvatore has almost always achieved what he set his mind to...a very effective poet brings a very fresh,vibrant n imaginary feel(not to forget the romantic touch) to his poems n essays and i have been moved so many times by his takes on poverty, student life, love and money. Never thinking twice about spending on frnds or going that extra step for them he has saved my ass on so many occasions....1st floor ah4 is anything but u, pritish and bhale  and writing this testimonial i am very sure that a part of my soul will always be with u on those bogmalo trips, those evening lake jogs and long conversations we had on that legendary staircase... all the best comrade wish u all the luck!!!!!!

<p>Shishir. You can love him or hate him, but you can never ignore him. As Kartik Mankad once put it "Kuch to baat hai is bande mein". From having the honour of being the first official d00d of the campus, to doing 2 projects under Singru, getting internship at the prestigious Rockwell Automation to shedding over 20 kgs, Shishir Shane Salvatore has done it all. We've had our differences thanks to his over the board cocky nature and my never ending sarcasm, but the quality that stands out are his purity of heart and his genuine emotions.This testimonial wouldn't be complete if I don't mention a few of what I term as "Shishirisms" like reciting a poem in a TRW presentation or his peculiar style of headbanging in a Waves concert, or him trying to give dating tips to a taxi driver (those who know him would certainly know what I am talking about). Well, it was good to know such a multitalented person and even better when that person is your friend. It was good knowing you Shishir and I hope you continue to remain the person you are. Have a great life d00d :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yafis-sahaf">Yafis Sahaf</a></p>
