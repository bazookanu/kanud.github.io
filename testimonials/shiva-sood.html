<p>He was my first friend in BITS. A hard core Mechanical Geek for many reasons, he has a very different personality. One of his greatest admirable quality - "he just don't give a shit about what people think about him (I guess I'm right). In addition to all, a funny guy in his own ways, and a good friend. We had few fights too, which I think has helped me to know him more and has strengthen our friendship too. I will always remember him, wherever I go and I wish him all the very best for a great future. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>A true giant, he is a great guy with some wittiness. I got to knw him btr during 3rd yr because of MEMS in which we were project partners. Ever since then we have been good frnds. He is probably the only guy in the mech department having contacts with each and every mech faculty. Yaar thoda kam padha kar ( at least xam ke baad 1 week ka rest toh liya kar). Well, he also has a giant heart with down to earth personality. I wish him a very successful and prosperous career ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>
