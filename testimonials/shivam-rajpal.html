<h1 class="page-title">Shivam Rajpal</h1><p>though his first impression was that of a boring nerd, he came across as a really great friend, always willing to help with every ounce of resource he'll have. had some great time with him in phonetics lectures! will cherish those moments :D 
he knows what he's doing and what he has to do (shrewd!) and is always to ready to muster knowledge from any possible source. happened to learn a few things from him :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>Intelligent, scrupulous and a zeal to learn anything new, best define this guy intellectually. On a lighter side, he is jovial company and the one guy who will never let you down if you ask for his help sincerely. A far-sighted guy, never backing down from a challenge, he has I am sure a bright future. That's the "Raju" I have always known and can say after looking at that ID pic finally, "Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman". Hope we remain life-long friends brother.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Best guy to be with if u want to do some last moment jugaad. Har lab mein 10 mins pehle report shuru karna aur full marks laana rajpal se seekho. And koi bhi software seekhne ka mauka mile, (who learns fluidsim!), toh sabse pehle karega. One thing I like about him is that he's always ready to learn something new. Great friend, and u can always trust him to get things done. And had fun in the AOM sessions. Always there to play "one last game".<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>

<p>First impression was of a very quiet introvert who always stays in his room. But I am glad to say that glaze ( his dc nick) has proved me wrong. Once I got to know him he was super fun to hang out with.  When he is not learning new languages ( he virtually learns every other that he can lay his hands on) he is busy doing time pass on fb . He is not a nerd as many might think, he is just a very jugadu person, Through eiit labs i have come to admire his unique ability of writing reports in the lab. Be it as assignment , or an online exam or any other work , raju will get it done through some or the other way. He is also a very avid gamer, often bunking the whole day after a long night seesion of AOM. Who can forget his rockinbeats radio,,!!!!( though he always plays the same genre) Raju is a great friend, always helps you out when you need him. I have had real fun times with you, All the best for the future<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>Radio, AOE, ENI phodu, AOE AOE AOE radio :P This is just a sneak peak into the wonderful mind of Shivam Rajpal. We got to know each other due to POM :) and the amazing activities we had did in class together. A great guy who can win over anyone with his smile, I know for a fact that he will have a great future. All the best and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>a very intelligent,down to earth and a very helpful guy.all the best for ur future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>He's an incredibly honest guy, the kind of which you don't get to see these days. He epitomizes "simple living and high thinking". Brilliant in almost anything he does, be it academics, AOE/AOM, and yeah, did i say he is /\ in electronics also. However, the thing that impresses me the most are his values and the strength of his character. I've never seen him utter an abuse or indulge in senseless gossip. I hope he continues to be the person he is. ( though i wouldn't mind a slightly less nerdy version of him ;) ) I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. 
P.S. 
I heard Rajpal is shifting focus from electronics to coding, so CS guys watch out coz there's some serious  ass kicking heading your way.

<p>He is my neighbor, still we talked in the second year for the first time, strange start huh? but once we opened it was like we were friends from childhood time. A down to earth guy , contagious smile,  simplicity and innocence are the attributes that best define him. no one has ever seen him angry (Ripley's Believe It or Not!). But don't get fooled by his innocence , he will trick you without a sweat. He is one of the rare guys who is talented as well as hardworking. One of the most  prolific coders in campus with a knowledge of more than a dozen languages ( some of which i haven't even heard of other than him e.g. eagle, mindfuck , etc,.)  He can learn a Software in no-time. he always rock acads even without studying ( suspicious :P ), and could have won as best participant of QUARK 2012 (won innumerable prizes), apart from acads he is awesome aoe2  and AOM player (bested by me only in AOM), by the way he is the owner of the most amazing radio of the campus Rockinbeatz radio. What to say more about our "raju". The confidence he bears will surely fetch fruitful results in future<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurav-kumar">Saurav kumar</a></p>

<p>Shivam- the perfect electronics student of our batch, his complete dedication to lighting up LED's on a breadboard is just unparalleled :P Starting as an introvert and gradually moving up on the extrovert scale, he has transformed into a guy, whose laughs and jokes echo through out the B-dome. A C-mess evangelist, his hard work and determination are surely going to bring him laurels in life :) All the best for your bright future Arduino ji:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>
<p>Rajpal.... the only guy i've known who didn't visit any place in goa other than vasco till his 3-1. I guess this is the reason for calling him NERDINO. But this is what he is... when it comes to studies, he is really very dedicated and sincere and he hardly cares about going somewhere but when he is out of the campus, you can see him fighting with bunty on the tracks :D... Though, he is skinny but he is the last person to get up from the dinner table and that too after receiving some looks. It's always nice to have him around. He is one of those fellows who are really knowledgeable and knows what they want to do. All the best for your life ahead.. wish you will keep going out :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>Shivam, The nocturnal (has the knack of always being asleep when the project guide calls). Though we knew each other earlier, I guess we got to know each other well only in 3-2 when both of us teamed up for a LOP. Shivam is that person who never shies away from a challenge. Be it setting insane objectives for a project (you wanted to do 2 projects in CDC semester? really?!) or taking part in random Quark events (and winning most). Ever eager to learn, his ability to tirelessly pursue a goal is appreciable. All the best for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>

<p>I have known Glaze aka Shivam for quite sometime now. We first met through our common love for AOM but after losing against me a bit too many times he left AOM for a while :P. Always took Greeks which I eventually  knew was beacuase he was a well known AOE pro too...Shivam is a very smart and intelligent guy who loves to understand and master new things. Very competitive and a little secretive :P, it's sometmes difficult to truly decipher his true intentions behind many things. A little quiet and a little on the nerdy :P side, he has opened up to having fun and letting it go as time has passed. Good at drawing and writing 'soupy' poems, his radio is quite popular.Recently though he has taken up the task of chatting up and 'pataying' girls(even senior ones!) who listen to it . In essence a sweet,smart,kind and helpful guy who works hard to get what he wants. Here's wishing you all the best for your future. :)
