<h1 class="page-title">Shivam Verma</h1><p>Sheeevam!! I don't have any recollection of the first day we met or how we started talking, it was either the DOSM trips where we hardly talked or the times we met because of Kriti  when again we hardly talked or the multiple times we bumped into each other where again we hardly talked and in the midst of all this no talking i don't know how we became such good friends. Since Sood left it was almost as if you took his place, with your constant jokes, pranks, weird texts and those "take Arushi's-case sessions"!(please at least admit now that you were "the king 300"!) I will always remember our trip to Cubana where you stood up for us and saved us from those DU guys (see i just made you sound so macho! :P). Its always fun to hang around with you. A super witty guy with an awesome sense of humor and one of the cutest and most decent people i have met (i am not writing all this because he has promised to give me an LV bag). Even though you take my case so much, i know at heart you are a great guy who will always have my back. All the best for future and stay in touch. Love you (but not like the love of my life :P)!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Shivam - aap Android Dude hai !!<p>
If it were not for Rahul and that SDPD(Android) course, I would not have probably met him. I have known him for hardly a semester, but I must say he's a fun guy to hangout with. Carefree as a chum, this guy has one awesome sense of humour. Time spent with him is a never-ending barrage of witty one-liners. Jokes aside, he is also pro at android, java and web development. 
The nightouts for android, chai-party in Rahul's room, laughing at his "kattas" , the epic Android Hackathon, and the Samsung Galaxy-Y will always be cherished. 
Wish you best in life. Meanwhile keep 9gaggin', for it surely has our souls :D

<p>had not been for the Android project, I would have never have met him though he is in my branch as he rarely comes to class (none this sem?? :P) ... is an exceptional coder and fun to be with... the time spent while doing the Android project with you and Parth in my room for 2 weeks was awesome and will be remembered for a long long time... also our mongi bets was also fun (i won most of the time :P) ... haven't seen a person more cool headed and calm... has an amazing sense of humor and always makes you laugh... be the way you are and all the best for the future sirji!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
<p>Shivam, our corridor dude is definitely the guy to hangout with. He sleeps during the day and is awake all night He has been a friend and neighbour for the past 3 years. A pro coder and an amazing Android developer, he loves to take part in competetions in the same. He watches a lot of movies and TV shows and is a great lover of music. He is a good singer himself. Birthdays in the corridor, outings , AOE and many other things would not have been the same without you. Although he has become a bit busy off late, he still manages time for us.(:P)  Wish you all the best for your future. Have a great life ahead!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
<p>Shivam! Mera padosi.That guy who came to Goa via Pilani and then Hyderabad! One of my first friends on campus. One of the best people to hang out with, for sure. Cool in his own unique way. A really good coder and an even better Android developer. Won the Android Hackaton quite recently ( I guess you finally found a buyer for that phone :D). Has a really good taste- be it movies, TV series or music. A good singer himself, should I say the 'Hariharan' of our corridor! And yes, an amazing whistler! Very good at AoE (_/\_ with the Byzantines).A proud Bihari(addressing himself as 'Hum' :) ) .We don't meet much nowadays though, thanks to his erratic sleep timings and a presence of a special someone :P. Still I'll always cherish all those times that I've spent with him :)
Wish you the very best in life and DO stay in touch  :)
Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/eeshan-modak">Eeshan Modak</a></p>
<p>Shivam ! By far, the coolest in our corridor. Corridor ka first admin. We share the same sleep timings so late night is the only time we see each other. Amazing to hang out. Takes people's case mercilessly (been a victim many times). Also a fellow mess-hater. Proud teetotaler, Android Pro (Saale next sem treat dede. Ghar baithe baithe intna kama raha hain !). One of the best untrained singers I've heard. Big Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam fan (Love the poster in your room ). Fellow AoE player and is damn good at it.Watches many movies and TV shows and always has some suggestion ready when I ping. One of the few friends who are staying back in 4-1. So here's to an awesome last sem with you and Cheers ! - Fungii<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>
<p>I remember the first time when I met him. He joined BITS at the time of 5th iteration. We became friends very quickly.(He should get the credit for that). I cant forget TT matches played with you in 1-1 till 4 am in the morning. I saw some very great movies with him on his laptop in the first year. AOE buddy. It's always nice to have him on you side in AoE. I also remember eating chings in the night( or at dawn to be precise). A nice person to be with. Now he has become a pro in Android.
I can't remember the last time when he went to mess. Must be somewhere in the 2nd sem :P.
Loves listening to music. He is good at singing too. 
All the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Shivam Pro Verma, a.k.a: Sheebum Baba is one of the coolest doooods you can find in campus. He is truly 'Proness personified'. Since first year, my opinion of him has been of one of the most entrepreneurial people I've met.  Apart from that, he is also a pro in Web Development and Android programming. I doubt ill ever forget all the nonsense we did over gtalk (especially 'Gandu the movie'). I think the reason why we clicked was because of our 'perpetually getting screwed' and last minute late night studying tendencies.  Had a great time with you, loads of fun.
Best of luck for the future. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>To think we actually bonded on some "Psycho" talk! :P Before that you were this other admin on titan called Megadebt! From then i guess there was just no turning back :P Countless chats, Vasco outings, Benaulim trip, night out, storm fest and many more things to come :P I cannot forget the Sushi Festival day when you and Syal had that funny bet ;) and later how we were posing as wolverine with chopsticks! xD You really are a good singer and i'm still upset that you haven't successfully taught me how to whistle :x Club Cubana was awesome and i'm sure you were really enjoying all that attention you were getting being in demand and all :D Storm was another hell of an outing (in more ways than one ;P) Just remember not to point your finger at me and say oye xD Sad that your not a dualite and so will leave a sem early :P Still, we had some amazing times and wishing for more to come :) Also, don't forget me when you make the restaurant app that'll make you a millionaire, treat me at Leela that time :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>
<p>Shivam Verma aka Fellow Bihariiiiiiiiiiii …. :P This guy is li8ness personified. Talked with him initially during EEEP labs (which was the only place he could be seen in B-dome :P) And then in 3-1, we interacted via Rahul. He is pro in web development, Android and Java toh puchoh hi mat ……… :) Very enthusiastic, calm, helpful and always has a smile on his face. Wish you all the best for your future endeavours and hope to keep in touch with you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
