<h1 class="page-title">shivang garg</h1><p>Shivi!! The 'other shivi' of our economics class, I was lucky to be corridor mate of this ultracool guy. His spontaneous jokes have often made our corridor lively. I owe all concepts of economics to this dude, had it not been for him I would have had anyone to discuss economic fundas in intricate detail and would have never understood the subject. This guy has always lent me notes for exams and helped me with doubts at the 11th hour! he has even taught me whole chapter and All the marks I score in economics are due to you, my friend :) Also, this guy is extremely easy-going and amiable, making friends instantly with anyone and everyone. This guy is the reason im able to wake up for exams and write (except once when he didnt wake me and i missed it). A fellow delhi guy, hope to see u this summer and now that we are neighbours in CH1 too, we shall share more epic moments :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
