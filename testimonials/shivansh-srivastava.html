<h1 class="page-title">Shivansh Srivastava</h1><p>The cool Role Model - His intellect and sense of sarcasm far exceeds anyone I have known. When people ridicule the 'ENI' guy - his calmness personifies the accomplishments on campus, all of which makes him the most unique person on campus I know. The Programmer, the sardonic charisma, the sports guy, the knowledge that he encapsulates within him & a li'l bit of singing that I have heard him hum, makes him a complete package!
He stays in his own world, rarely listening to any conversations we had over the years, yet his Devil-may-care attitude is gonna take him further heights he hasnt even dreamt of achieving. 
Always stay in touch!

<p>TV shows, Football, Programming, Satire in his voice, the Devil-may-care attitude - makes him the wholesome package deal. Everyone loves this guy. The sheer timing of his comments was impeccable. Often he dosed off in the middle of many a conversations, & subtly remarking in between to let us know that he is "still very much interested". 
His excuses were undoubtedly out of this world, & his efforts of coming out with such vague, random, unbelievable excuses were worth a watch
His thirst for knowledge makes him hungry for more success. btw..congrats on gsoc!
It was him that made me a Man Utd fan; & ironically it was him that made me hate it!
It was fun to know the nicest & funniest person I have known!

<p>Acquaintance - Friend - Best Friend - Brother (- Lover?) || This isn't where it ends. This isn't farewell. And there won't be a one. Not before Manchester United get relegated from the Premier League.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>This one is the craziest of the three morons residing in 244. A true WIKI donor he is.  I still cant believe he hasn't treated me for the GSOC he got. He is the leader of the "moron GANG". A not so DELHIite this one, always trying to make me feel that I am a south Indian (I AM NOT). It is always fun going to the mess, or ice n spice with him,and seeing the amount of food he will INGEST, considering his size. The first person i know who cuts his hair on his own :P. Ill always remember the boring conversations of Ashesh and Shivansh about their FUTURE :). All in all a good friend, a nice person. Wish you All The Best for your future. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tanmay-binaykiya">Tanmay Binaykiya</a></p>
<p>My very first friend on campus,he is one of the most sincere and hard-working students i have ever met.Our first semester together was a joy ride as we both had common interests in music and gaming(fifa). His dedication to BITSAA is just unbelievable; a humble, down to earth person, coding and computers is his main interest. The last subject we did try to study together was EG(:P) and after that he became a dedicated coder, working right into the nights and sleeping in the early mornings. Gsoc is just another feather in his pocket.A \m/ gamer, he is one of the best in FIFA be it the 2010,11 or 12 versions. He is one guy who helps you, be it anytime or anywhere,makes you laugh and whose company is just enjoyable.I know that things might have been a whole lot different but life is just like that- roads that fork into multiple paths and you have to choose your own way. My sincere regards to your family and all the best for the future ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>
<p>The "Stud" of our campus.I have shared lots of good times with you,the late night talks staring at CH5 and talking non sense,cafe manji,the day when we were robbed,ice n spice,the list is endless....I met you the first day and you still don't remember that,you were standing near higginbothams with your certis and stuff alone so i came and asked "new admission,which branch" and the only good thing i took away from conversation was u were from Delhi :D.I have seen a lot a lot of people in my life but none of them even comes close to being dedicated to their future as much as you.You have taught me lots of valuable lessons and have changed my thinking more than you know.You taught me  FIFA and introduced me to Football in a different way.I am very thankful for all of that.Coming to you just some of you traits "Good-Looking"Excellent Coder"Funny" The Gr8est Manu Fan" and don't worry you will not die alone and will find most awesome girl.I could go and on about you but i think you know how much i will miss you :).So best of luck for the future man i know you can achieve anything just believe in that instinct of yours.
PS:Campus ke baad paisa aa jaye to bhool mat jaio saare pacts MR. Chandler Srivastava :D
Fare Well..............<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/puneet-pratap-singh-chauhan">Puneet Pratap Singh Chauhan</a></p>
<p>He is THE Dude. He easily is one of the coolest and talented persons on the campus. Apart from having a electifying personality, he can be defined as the personification of the saying - suvival of the one who can adapt to change. Battling out unfortunate circumstances, a leader and someone who is very clear in his mind of what he wants(or doesn't wants). The Bitch that he is (:P), but all in all a nice person to know who keeps on learning and doing stuff, climbing on top armed with knowledge on diverse topics.
And of course, the Sarcasm - what can be said!
We have had some great times, and hopefully we'll have it in the future too :D
Man, be the way you are and keep on growing. It's been inspiring to know you, and though i have it very bleak, hope we'll keep in touch.
All the very best in your life, may you go and do what you want :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>I remember him from the first we met when my ankle was broken in my first year and when I was struggling to walk he helped me up stairs even though we didn't know each other till then he said " Don't worry dude, bahut jaldi we'll play football together" . This shows the two most important characteristics of Shivansh football and people skills. The BITSAA secretary (frankly i don't understand why) and the most dedicated person in BITSAA, hardly a gets along for him without BITSAA. He may look very simple, funny, care free and take it easy kinda guy but bahut bada kamina hai yeh, he has achieved a lot in these 3 years but that's given the amount of hard work and dedication he puts into what he really likes. I will kill him if he doesn't give a huge treat if he gets the Gsoc money. Around him no one can stay without laughing their asses off to his jokes and that's why i have enjoyed each and every second I spent with you, harshit, puneet and harshit be it the trips we've been on or the nights we spent chatting or the card games we play or be it FIFA.....what can I say about FIFA ?? If a book was written about us then the name of the book would be FIFA, he was my perfect partner for 2 v 2 because of the shockingly similar game play of our's. We have spent countless hours and days playing FIFA and debating about football and i can't imagine my stay here without those two. A true red devil (or evil ?) and always keeps saying ManU should be winnig UCL and in my mind i keep thinking "seriously ? dafuq" and will be pissed of even if ManU concedes a goal(imagine his state when they lost  1-6). I can write a book about his love for football but this is where I'll sign off bidding him a farewell and wishing him the best in life!! Take care and always stay in touch.

<p>BITSAA cordi, shivansh is one of those rare guys who has hardly changed over the years. Has this brilliant i-dont-give-a-fuck attitude and that has persisted over the years. TThis one loves his laptop and would hardly see that it comes to formatting to fix it. Values HDD space more than gold and has about 2TB of HDDs stashed with god-knows what content, 
The one thing you can count upon this guy is that during any exam, no matter what sem, when you pass his room enroute to water cooler you will hear the TV-series laughter emminating from some show or other he  is rewatching. Quite a relaxer that is.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhaavan-merchant">Bhaavan Merchant</a></p>
<p>Shivansh was one of my first friends on campus. Incidently he and I used to be in the same coaching institute but neither of us had bothered to know the other guy's name. However, in campus we became close friends on the first day itself and I remember the relief I felt on seeing his familiar face. We did share some special moments as friends and although unfortunately, some misunderstandings crept into our friendship, nevertheless I always considered him to be a good person. I wish him the very best that life has to offer.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yafis-sahaf">Yafis Sahaf</a></p>
<p>Shivansh, met him in one of the many carrom encounters of the famous ah4 common room . There was and instant connection which culminated into a strong frienship. This resulted in many all nighters , those in which we did nothing but play nfs. It was you who converted me into a football fan. From cricket to football, the credit goes to you. He is effortlessly multi talented . Be it his oratory skills or interpersonal skills he becomes good at anything he lays his hands on. He is also a pro coder, and good gamer. He might not gel with all the people all the time but you have the courage to accept the truth, a quality which i admire. Congrats for gsoc , all the best for life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurav-kumar">Saurav kumar</a></p>
<p>You've been one of my best friends ever. We've shared so much over the last three years; it's been one hell of a journey.
I have met very few people who can multitask the way you do. I often wonder how you are able to learn so much, and implement it too. I've really admired the way you care so much about what you want and see to it that you do your best no matter what. You've been a great inspiration to me and I've quite often tried to adopt the attitude you have towards what is most important to you. You never give up. 
You've always been good at what you do. Although, it's very difficult to keep track of what you've been up to coz you are doing so much in so little time. I'll always remember all the ManU matches and my very own "Score?" after every defeat, especially this season and how they lost on goal difference even after being what 5 points ahead of City? (Just saying :D). 
I'll also remember all our conversations about getting the hell out of this place, working for a kick-ass software company and end up managing one as well! I'm really proud of what you've achieved in these three years, and I'm sure you will achieve even greater things. GSoC is just the beginning! Wish you the very best. Cheers!
