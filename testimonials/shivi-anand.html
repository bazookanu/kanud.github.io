<h1 class="page-title">Shivi Anand</h1><p>Kiwi!! My music loving singer friend! :D I guess we bonded over my speakers which are collecting dust most of the time now :-\ Happy to have you in my corridor, has made up for many boring times! I can never forget the time you me and Arushi were jamming in your room! That was one hillarious day xD. We have had many fun times and many DJ nights together and i'm hoping for more to come in the future :) Cheers ;) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>
<p>Shivi!! My first friend on campus! I still remember self-inviting myself in that Avril blaring room saying "hey, i like Avril too,can i sit?!" and cliched as it might be, rest is history!  You were somebody that i figured out college life with, whether it was ogling at those seniors in awe, figuring out the streets of Goa, hitch-hiking, screaming our lungs out to linking park and the weirdest of songs possible,entering classes most fashionably late, climbing the campus wall, painting our nails black, trying each other/other people's dresses(if you know what i mean :P) taking acads lite (read night before prob stats compre) we did it all! (sounds like i lived my entire college life in the first year itself!) An amazingly talented singer, this girl, trust me is tougher than half the men out there. Extremely trustworthy, you can tell her anything and be absolutely sure that it will not go to anyone else. You have always been there whenever i have needed a friend and i really hope that will stay forever. I will always remember our countless gossiping/bitching/cribbing sessions. We have had so many fun and adventurous times together, hoping to have many more in the future. All the best for life. :)
P.S Forgot to mention, you are an important reason for me and Kunal being together, i owe you one for that! :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Hey, I read your lesbian article.
My what..?
Your lesbian article. In the LDC magazine. Well written man.
Dude, it wasn't a lesbian article. She just inspired me to write it. 
Oh.
*awkward silence*
I liked it more when I thought it was a lesbian article. Damn.

Little do they know.

I'm glad I like spicy food. Kinda like the root of all this, ain't it? When we brainstormed, and how, about music and movies and dishes and cities, and that's all we had in common. 
Spicy food.
You know, somewhere between the cramps in my neck from falling asleep on your stupid  bed and the exam seasons we spent, devoid of conversation, somewhere between doing your hair for prom-nights and harmonizing the shit out of your songs, between the drunken hugs and the awkward mornings,  I realized, I could never write you a testimonial. It's a way in which people say bye, and show they're ready for you to leave, isn't it? 
Well, yeah, I'm never going to get there.

This was truly some kind of wonderful.

<p>Fivi.. hmm, where do i start ! Ok great this seems a place http://www.rlps.org/photo/shivi_p2.jpg *oooh look what i found !* , One for the Pre "Kekdi" days :D .  One of the first people I ever met on campus , and as it turned out it was a blast from the past , apparently I knew her since over a decade (the pic may perhaps be somewhere close :D ) and yet was a complete stranger , not for long though given the all day trolls  , trips to bogamalo & NOFRA and endless conversations . This one is definitely a cut out different. Yes she's got that 90210 yak yak and outright pretentious piss off put ons that you just want slam out at first, but on the contrary it's  such  great fun that you don't want this Pandora's box to stop (Be warned , it's impossible to even try stopping this woman on a rampage, DO NOT TRY ) . If you are one for the crazy, you can count on her , be it a trek on the rocks or an epic binge fest or one of those super fun but outright insane thing that lingers on for ever , checked off the "TODO" list , This Chick here is the one ! What else, Let's see a great taste in music, a decent singer, perhaps a good one, i'll give you one thing , one of the best takes on "Khaabo Ke Parinde" i have heard , no kidding. As a close friend , its a delight to hang out with her , not a dull moment , moody as hell  and yet dependable as a rock and to put it down as whirlwind of contrasting epiphanies would probably be fair. For one don't change, it that makes you who you are. Shivi it's been a pleasure knowing you and hanging out and spending time with you. I know there is one last instalment of fun left but I will admit, it'll be one of those things I'll probably miss the shit out of once that's over. Toodles and stop being a douche and you'd better stay in touch. In the mean while, go make a dent on the world that's your's to make. Shine on You Crazy Diamond !

<p>Shiweeeeee !!! Exactly as it’s written in so many desks of our classrooms and LTs…ab toh apna naam har table pe likhna bandh kar !! Well…I can’t remember where or when we first met…or I can’t imagine what we used to talk about then…it merely seems like a few days when I got to know you so much better ? what with sharing those never-ending bio, cas and pom classes…Now where do I begin to thank you…every effing dance night or fest night, you were always around and you made it better…singing a stupid song any time was never as bad when you would join in and we would together make fun of each of its lines :P Each of us has learnt one lesson, if not any other, from you shivi, and that’s never to part with your money unless absolutely necessary ! Oh wait…also having 10 meals a day and mooching off others is nothing to be ashamed of…rather it’s an art and only a few are blessed with it ;-) But believe me, now that I understand, I totally second the thought :D I will totally miss each of these tiny little things about you…where do I find a as enthusiastic a dancer as you (some believe she dances like Hritik Roshan in Koi Mil Gaya :P ) …Who would come up to me with the best gossip around and trade it only for a better one…this is not done…people like us, we have to stick tight to each other…be it in Bangalore or some other city, hope we meet and keep partying….after all, what’s a party without you and me in it, eh ?!!!!   
With love, always =)

<p>We haven't known each other much and had very few moments together. What compels me to write this testimonial are some of your qualities that made me think " Scchh I wish I had those things !" Admittingly you are one Free-spirited , Smart , Daring woman I came across. I call it woman because you are more matured according to me to call you a Girl. You have a beautifully modulated voice and you carry yourself with awesome confidence which I like about you the most . Smart , Intelligent you seem to know many things outside the academic (not acads I meant abt the world ). No doubt you have great looks , beautiful face and a style with which you carry yourself. Its been great to know a person like you however superficial it might be. Still you will remain a person whom I remember in my BITS-life.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
