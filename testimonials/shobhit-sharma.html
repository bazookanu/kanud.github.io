<p>Hi physics lover, you are very studious, disciplined, smart (handsome too :P) and a big rock music lover. I feel lucky to have you as my neighbor. You have said me once that your parents are to worried whether you can manage things yourself and will you stay disciplined. I can say you are way beyond their expectations and I feel you are the most disciplined and responsible about things. You are independent and you also love food sometimes (veggy though :P). You have a clear idea about your future and you live the life the way you like. I like the playlist you have created for me and I wish you stay in touch and help me in the songs in future too.....  :D.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>Hey shobhit..You are among the ones who is responsible for successful completion of my M.Sc. Physics :P. You are god of physics man..you understand everything well :)  We had lots of fun and I will miss you next year as neighbor. You are very hard working and I have learnt a lot from you. Your aspirations are very good. Your hard work makes you outstanding. I wish you all the best for the rest of your life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/santosh-ayyagari">Santosh Ayyagari</a></p>
<p>Shobhit, the designer! I first came across this guy when he applied as a designer for DoJMA. He seriously blew my mind with his design, and kept blowing it off during every new issue of BITS Herald. Seriously, I have never met anyone as creative as him. Combined with his grasp of Physics, Shobhit is truly a force to reckon with! I won't forget the times we spent in his room designing and listening to Metallica \m/. I think I am going to be your neighbour in CH1, so I look forward to listening to more your playlist! :D. Good Luck, and see you mate!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>Shobhit!! God of physics !! a ardent music fan plus a lot of hard work plus a lot of intelligence makes this person. He has been a friend to me since the past 3 years and ill miss having you in the corridor :( , one of the first friends i have in this campus, he is very helpful , so down to earth and very friendly. Probably one of the most intelligent persons i have ever seen too.Am pretty much sure this guy will reach great heights. All the best man!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>Shobith..One among the guys whom I respect the most. Extra brilliant, equally good in sports and yet he is humble and down to earth. He is fun loving and time spend with him is worth it. I owe him big time for helping(by helping i mean "doing completely") me with the project.. I will always remember the discussion sessions(chudaap done by me and Asati) when you were working your ass out. Shobhit is one of the coolest guy in campus and I will miss the outings and the fun we had together in 3rd year ..Wishing him all the luck to reach heights ..(ob he will...:D)..and tc... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>
<p>Shobhit Sharma aka Chobit, Cho-cho and the various other lame nicknames I have managed to come up with for him is in his native language, a simply 'bhaukali' person :P . Insanely lazy with regards to attending classes (I quote him when I say that he would be delighted to do a correspondence course from his own room XD ) he nevertheless manages to pwn all his courses simply because he starts studying and then cranks it up to the 'nth' level :D . A diehard music lover, many a time have I been startled awake in the morning with his damn metal music blasting through my walls >.< . A kind and just God should never give you a metalhead as your neighbor. But jokes aside, he is one heck of a neighbor to have (case in point, I have made it my morning ritual to go to his room right after waking up and then moaning about my daily problems :P , you do not do that with an ordinary neighbor ) . To be honest, the first time I saw that he was gonna be my neighbor, I was a little apprehensive because he looked like a proper goon :P . But we started talking, discovered our shared love for music (we do have SOME overlapping genres) and haven't looked back since B| . All I would like to say at the end is that, thanks for being my neighbor, entertaining the shit out of me with your twisted little sense of humor %) and I am insanely proud to call you my friend. I will not say "best of luck for later, I am sure you will do good" etc etc because with you, its a given. Cheers!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>
<p>Shobhit..!! He’s one of the most hard-working guys I’ve ever met. Always ready to help anyone with whatever problems they might have. I’ve known him only since the past one year but I must say he’s one of my closest friends now. Whenever we two are together you’ll always find us laughing and giggling about some thing or other. However tense the situation might be, we both manage to have a tummy-aching laughter. He’s very passionate about physics, everyone knows that. His intuition and hard-work will sure take him to some Ivy-League college(Harvard :P….remember).Also we share a lot of common liking in music (thrash _|_  :P). But seriously he’s a hard-core Metal fan. He can probably work for some Music magazine, this guy has amazing musical knowledge too. He’s also good at creative writing. I hope you have a great time in Seattle dude.  I know we’ll all be in touch.keep in touch no matter what. Best of luck for your future. ? <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-krishna-kant">R Krishna Kant</a></p>

<p>Shobhit... I still remember those EG practicals when i used to sit next to you and copy most of the answers :P. Have known you since and seen you phodophy the courses one after the other. Truly and intelligent fella, still down to earth, cracking jokes, laughing, fooling around and always with a smile on his face. Not much bothered about whats going around but will come for help if anyone needs it. There is just no doubt that you will do wonders with your life. So all i can say is all the best mate... may you get all what you wish for and do stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Shobhit Sharma!! I remember him meeting in 2-1 at Monjinis during registration when he was asking whether we had to take up MOS or not(unfortunately, we had to) With that pyari-si-luckhnow-ish-hindi and that ever present smile on his face its comforting to have him around. Although(at times) he start worrying about exams and etc his presence will always get you thinking that "Everything is Maya… Li8 lo ab.. Kar lenge kuch an kuch" Makes one all the more relaxed and happy. It has been a pleasure to spend those too-tired-of-studying-at-library and  in-between-class breaks at Monjinis. Those Bogmallo and Dudhsagar trips will always remain with me. We have at least one more year to go together mate, computer cdcs!!!  I hope you help me around, just like you always have in those computer projects and those countless-physics-assigments. With that talent and the hardworking-never-say-die and dedicated attitude of yours, you have got quite some heights to scale. Ofcourse we will always remain in touch, but nevertheless I will miss you my friend. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
