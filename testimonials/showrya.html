<p>Showrya is one of my most special friends in the campus. She is also one of the cutest and wonderful person around. Very hard working , she rocks all the subjects. I love to call her toppy (but she doesn't like it :P) She is one of those persons whose lights go off at 10pm :P I have lots of memories of wonderful moments spent with her (especially how you attacked me with cake on your own B'day :P). She is always very jolly and cheerful and loves to help people out. Every semester, there are extra classes of Maths subjects in her room, and trust me she is an awesome teacher :) Will miss you a lot dear. Do keep in touch. Wish you all the best for future :)

<p>showrya ..The first 4nd i got in BITS .I still  remember the first time we met in shop co (SBI bank).she is very kind and pure hearted, very helpful, pleasant minded,  delectable, soft ,agreeable manners  but get too tensed in sm situations.She is cute and flatters evryn1 with her smile.I think  therez nthng left to share btw us. We got close together when we were ragged together for the first time near mongi where I came to know she likes black  and later on our bonding got stronger . I can still remember the days we spent in ur room in first year . We had wonderful time together here. U have a great future ahead . All the best dude..

<p>The “IS reference book”…there can’t be a better name for her…trust me her notes >>> Text buk…she completes atleast one 200page notebook per a course :O :O…She’s too good at acads, especially subjects involving maths( I guess) and yeah she’s also the ACAD-REP of IS _/\_ _/\_, EM of a coding in QUARK-2012. In the beginning I thought you might not be able to handle the event properly, but as time passed by and as we started the 1st round(2nd part) I realised that you have organised that so perfectly….good job to u and ur team :D. Keeping ACADS aside, showrya is a very decent, determined, hardworking, calm, cool (except during exams..super tensed ) girl. She has got a good smile, one should watch her blushing when u call her “NERD”…hahah I used to lyk pulling ur leg all d tym by dng tat :P. Anyways I’m sure that, with the passion you, you’ll have a bright future ahead. All the best. Keep smiling as always :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srinivasa-lahiri">Srinivasa Lahiri</a></p>
<p>Smart, attractive, nerdy, crazy, cute, beautiful...... i met this girl first in maths 2 classes when she used to brilliantly solve the problems, seeking immediate attention of everyone around her. I always found her very sincere... never saw her reading late nights before exams. She has a perfect balence between acads and extra curricular. She always extends her helping hand to the one in need. She is a perfect blend of all emotions; showing extreme love towards the person she loves and doesnt care about the person whom she hates. According to me, she is a very unique person on earth. I wish her all the best for her future endeavours.
