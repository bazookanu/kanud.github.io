<p>Shrenik Khot is one of the friends of mine from Pune. In the first semester his room was the common room for people like Datye, Tanmay, Sahil myself and many more. Later he shifted to the top floor stating Academic reasons, and then he has proven to all what he is capable of. This guy not more than 5ft 4in is one of the guys I respect most on campus. Those days spent in his room playing fifa10 in the first year, the cards and his very own business ( oh man this is making me very sentimental). I know that we havent been able to spend as much time as we used to, but one thing for sure he is among those friends whom I will cherish and remember for years to come. I wish him all the luck and success that is there in the world. Shrenik I am thankful to God that we met!!

<p>Mama...... he is the "small wonder" of our batch but he can beat even Habbu in any competition... he is an example of "size DOESNT matter".  A huge fan of football and F1(he taught me the basics) and he is one of the proest FIFA 10,11 players I have ever seen.  Recently he has become a pro in AOE and CS too.  Through the last hear he has been a great supporter of my "Sachin Tendulkar should retire theory" and he helps me in making Kawley mad. He cant play cards ... so I used to enjoy beating him at that. His room has always been the place where we used to gather and play poker or business etc. Wish you all the best in the world and I hope we stay friends for a long time... CHEERS!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-sathe">Gaurav Sathe</a></p>
<p>Mamujaan......... kans mama.. mama mia.. kya kya bolega ye bhatija es mama ke baarein mein. Shrenik Khot ye naam cum aaur Mama jyaada yehi campus mein mere one of the closest friends ki kahani hain. He is the one of the few persons here who I can rely on anytime anyday.He is the one who "wakes" me up.Mama Kon uthavnaar mala for next months ??? I don't want to Be kumbhakaran bein. :P.. He is pro gamer and the ability of his to grasp things so quickly amazes me everytime. In a short time,he became one of the pro players of AOE in our hostel. Now inspite of playing AOE night in and day out, He manages to score excellent in his acads.That I must credit to his hardworking nature.During Exams, He is so dedicated that he may even skip food for it. His knowledge about different things ( some credit that to this neighbor GOD of course ) makes him one of the few people on campus who are  intelligent brainy. He is a damn awesome cricketer ,footballer,tt player,badminton rackquetier ..in short a perfect sportsman and the one you would love to follow and become one day.  There are so less words to describe this little wonder being.  I Have only one thing to say.. "My MaMa the greatest " .. :) .

<p>Mama - I have no clue why people call him that but he is a great guy. I have known him since my first year and it has been an awesome ride ever since. I will always respect him for truly rocking AMOS, and I'll never forget how nervous he was with his doubts just before the exam. He is pretty chilled out, focused about his future and great fun to be around if he is in the right mood. He often feels that I always end up talking about academics with him, but unfortunately it is true because there isn't much in common between the both of us.I know he is going to have an awesome future and I wish him all the best for that :) Smile more and be happy always :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Mama... I started to know him when we were DEMs of the same event in 1st year. in first year he used to take li8 but when he changed his room and came in the room next to my room ( I really dont know what changed him) he started cracking exams and acing also. A person whose room is always clean. A pro FIFA player. Thinks practically and handles responsibilities effectively. He has very good managerial skills. he loves to make models in Catia. he has made a Hostel common room, water tap and many more. A very good scooty driver :P
Somehow manages to finish his studies before the exam but gets under pressure on the exam day. He has always given me company in making silly mistakes in the exams. Though sometimes these mistakes have caused a damage to hostel property :P
He gets very angry sometimes but then cools down quickly. He is very disciplined and very particular about keeping things in their proper place.( I and rane always tell him that his kids are going to suffer a lot if they don't obey him :P). A person who loves to watch movies with love story in it. 
Most important of all... he wakes up the whole corridor during exams. His door full of sticky notes during exams. All of us would have missed a lot of exams if he wasn't there.
I m sure that he is going to be a strict but effective manager or may start a company of his own. All the best for that....

<p>Chotya ! Mama ! Tingya ! and what not I used to call him, this guy with height less than 5 fts is one of those first friends I made on campus. I still remember when we met, we were playing chess, you were a good player, me noob but yes I won I remember it yet. Come from class drop your bag in Shrenik's room play fifa irritate him then go to mess come back and do tp in his room was my routine for the first sem. Those were the awesome days, then playing TT and having fun. He shifted his room to the epic corridor where his CG increased exponentially. I just llove the way he takes things, his cricket skills are perfect, plays lan games well and used to defeat me in Fifa :(
A Mech Lover who shall make some simplistic car one day !  He's been really helpful and a true friend, a good advice giver and a concerned friend. Thanks Man for being there !

I wish a great future for you and hope you achieve your goals. 

PS. Bhakarwadi whenever you got for me specially, I thank you from bottom of my heart for that, next time also get some :P

<p>Mama. Not many people know that this nick came from a longer one. Shakuni Mama. Because I could see this weird glint in his eyes when he used to play cards. But then, Mama quickly went from being a funny to a really affectionate nick name. He might be short (very) but he's really mature. He strikes fear into me and Rane. A simple glare from him says it all. He has really been like a parent to me on campus :D. He is one of the most regular and disciplined guys I have seen. Apart from all this, he's a prop FIFA, AoE player and Mech guy. Real good at the softwares.Amazing sports person, football, cricket, this guys plays it all. He generally wakes everyone up during exams. Seriously, Mama coming on to our floor has really been amazing and I can't think what I would do without him on this floor. Always remember, "Murti lahaan pan Kirti mahaan" -Fungii<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>
