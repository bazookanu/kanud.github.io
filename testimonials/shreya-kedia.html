<p>"Big surprises come in small packages"  is what comes to my mind when i think of her! She is exceptionally well in studies and can excel in whatever is given to her. Despite her excellent performance in studies, she is an extremely humble person, very helpful(thanks a lot for all the notes :)), really sweet to talk to and very frndly by nature. N ya, i remember all the times when we went out and sumhow, we both ended up sitting together everytime :P n den she wud pass crzy comments which gave me a tough time controlling my laughter :P:D also, all the dj nites when all of us reunited was so much fun :D all the gossiping that we used to do in my room were so much fun! Now that we part our ways and just a few more days left together, i wish you all the very best in future. I am sure you'll achieve the greatest heights possible. Keep up the good work and stay in touch!! :):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Epitome of "Great things come in small packages " :P ( Sorry, couldn't help mention it) ... She is one of those extremely sincere dedicated people around this place... Humble person who helped me out quite a few times this semester ... And i trouble her a lot.. especially during exams to ask for portions and notes and she doesnt mind it (atleast seems so as she readily helps me out again next day ) :P ... her sense of humour is equally great .. i won't forget that April fool's day prank..I was least expecting something like that from you Shreya !! Best of luck for your future life. I'm sure you are going to be an extremely successful person. :)

<p>If you are looking for real brains in a girl, look no further. She has that thing in ample quantity, not to mention a good amount of nervous tension too and  oh so eternal complaints about all the worldy troubles she has to bear such assignments, tests, projects  and what not ..u get d picture :P

She's a quick learner and can go deep if she wants to. Very focussed on her studies, she is sincerely interested towards her field. An ardent fan of Gone With The Wind, she perhaps considers herself as the little version of Scarlett O Hara :P who knows.. She loves novels and reads them with interest and pride :P
A little short tempered, it's not a very good idea to be on her wrong side. Loves gossip and just needs a push and then she can drone for hours on end. Loves her friends and is very helpful when you really need it. All in all a very sweet and smart girl in a cute little package :P

Keep rocking and all the best for ur future :)

<p>Recollecting the day Shreya first came to the Goa Campus to live in room number 104 in my corridor, I honestly feel like laughing at myself for thinking her to be some student’s kid sister. The petite little girl that she is, she is filled with lots of energy and has great potentials in her. She hails from my hometown Kolkata, which is what made us so close during all these years. Talking in Bengali, discussing every little element in Kolkata that makes the place different from other metros has become our everyday thing by now. Now, you may think you know her but understanding her is not all that easy since she is not the person to pour her heart out to you (atleast she won’t open up so candidly to everyone and anyone but people who are close to her). During the small holidays when everyone gets ready to spend a few days at home she is one girl who will  be here (Kolkata being so far) and then it becomes awesome fun to go out to places, just the two of us. We have had some amazing trips to places like Colva, Madgaon, Panjim, Bogmalo and Vasco and most of our trips were the outcome of impromptu plans which we made out of boredom on campus. Each of these trips have been real fun with you Shreya….I missed them over the vacations and now that I am going for my thesis in my first semester while you go in your second semester…I am gonna miss them all the more….Also, can’t forget some absolutely crazy discussions we have had on totally random topics….the movies we watched together….the experiences have been absolutely splendid. The DJ nites on campus and commenting on the weirdest dancers on the floor were awesome with you. Having said all of this, I believe you have always been the more mature one out of the both of us and just the apt person to take advice regarding anything and everything beginning from relationships to lamest stuffs like clothes and cosmetics. I have seen Shreya go through good as well as bad phases during the past three years on campus and to be honest, I haven’t met a more pragmatic personality than her. She knows just the right way to maintain friendships be it with her school friends back at home or us, her friends on campus. Although she may appear so tiny, she has got brains I must say. Extremely intelligent and a very helpful friend, she is just the kind of person anyone would love to be with. She also has a very caring nature towards all the people who are very close to her. There is also this quality in her of being really great with kids…she has a lot of patience with them…that’s what makes her so fit to be a core member of Abhigyaan….must say she was really dedicated to the Abhigyaan activities. Oh yeah…how can I forget the fact that she has a monopoly over the color pink (LOL!!)…literally every item in her room will have some tinge of pink in it :D  Anyway she is actually a very sweet person but at times can really behave like a naughty little kid who plays pranks on people. Sometimes, when she gets irritated with something she can end up getting disappointed with you and this has sometimes (not very often) made us fight with each other…but then these never lasted long….both our anger soothe down in a short while and then we again end up like as though nothing had happened at all. Then again, I believe these little what I call nok jhoks between friends is a part and parcel of life and it just makes the friendship grow stronger between two people…the same applies for us too. Leaving at the end of this sem makes me feel as though we will not meet for god knows how many years. Oh God!! I hope it never comes to this point. Even though I leave at the end of this sem only to come back in 4-2 again when you won’t be there I will always hope to stay in touch with you. You have been an amazing friend to whom I can pour my heart out with the belief and faith that it will remain in confidence and your opinions on the same will always be helpful. I consider myself fortunate to have met you and I believe all good things come to an end and so is our time together in the college coming to an end very soon, so now just to avoid getting senti any further as I pen down these words for u I will just wish you good luck for all your future endeavors and hope that you achieve great success in life in whatever you do. May God bless you!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sneha-choudhury">Sneha Choudhury</a></p>
<p>" Small Wonder ".. As I may put it.. :D .. Got to know her during my 3rd year during the Assignment... One who is known in our batch for taking down ample amount of notes... Writes down each and every word that is uttered by the prof..  (Waste of lots of pens & papers :P)... A very sincere person .. never bunks classes...Extremely brainy... that her brain seems to be larger than herself.. :P. Got infinite amount of storage space in there... Her dedication towards anything has no bounds...Once decided, never leaves a thing... Gets a bit fidgety around deadlines though.. :D..  Pretty much childish most of the times... :D A charming personality ... A fun-to-be-around person.. A very much of a quick thinker she is.. Also witty at times.. Gets to the solution very faaast... A person who loves to take shortcuts.. (and they turn out to be right always.. )... Kudos to you and your efforts... :D.. Glad to meet you... :) I believe with a dedication and that BIG brain of yours... you will build castles in the air.. Keep it up... :) May all your dreams come true..
PS -  Keep on taking down notes.. :D :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-datye">Chaitanya Datye</a></p>

<p>Shreya..when I first met her, I thought that she is somebody’s younger sister and now, when I remember that time, I have a good laugh. Looks like a small kid, but takes very mature decisions. A fun-loving person who aces all the subjects she studies. I remember the time we had all our classes common…workshop time when you always forgot to wait for me ( :P), or the EG time where I could never have studied without you…or fufa time…finance classes would never have been same without you..we had our share of misunderstandings and fights..but I am so glad the things are back to normal now.  Perfect combination of beauty with brains to tu hi…bas you lose temper a bit fast, but then, nobody is perfect in this world….you can see her doing full time pass even when exams are a week after..but then with her focus and hardwork she will perform in every exam possible..love your hair and your choice in buying clothes ( have helped me sooo many times with it )..I hope you achieve everything you desire..ob tu phodegi her cheez..all the best..hope we have another awesome semester…love u!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
