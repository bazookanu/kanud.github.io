<h1 class="page-title">Shreyans Jain</h1><p>Its only words that words that I have for this best buddie of  mine.Dont remember when I met him first,rather I would say that the question is irrelevant as he seems a part of my life since ever..

As a person very industrial whether its his work rate at the football field, dedication to the DePP work and sometimes the normal boring studies.I have rarely come across someone who puts in so much.I would say "Shreya-Everything pays off in the longer run,and you are bound for an awesome future,just keep in the effort.

Too much of serious talk,he is fun to be around whether the common room  rooting for Manchester United,Rajashthan Royals or its the fun trips we have.The way he carries our small modern family,hats off to him.Ya occasionally,he gets upset about things close to his heart,but the fun is getting his mood back to normal.Sorry yaar,given the contrasting time-tables,opposite routines and unending commitments, I have spent much time with you off-late,but the feeling remains.Given a chance would like to re-live the BITSIAN journey with him all over again.Will really miss for the next semester,but would ensure that our 4-2 is the best six months of our campus life.Best for luck for your future assignments,stay happy,keep smiling as you are worth it.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>

We have all had some of the best road trips !! And each and every part of it was just so Awesome !! Loved it !! :-* One with whom you can't study in lib because he will keep on cracking some of the "greatest pjs" ever and you will be bound to laugh ! :P I remember you sending me this song "Brictom" which drove me crazy and I listened to it for like 14-15 times in a loop for 5 days !! :| When shreyans is around one thing you can't miss out on is his "Nautanki" !! He has this great ability of doing it anywhere on this Earth !! :\ "you suck" ! :P Shreyans is Mr. Twitter Fanatic who can spend hours and hours on his cell Tweeting !! :P His general knowledge is highly appreciable !! :) And haan.. You have one "mogu mogu" due for me ..not one actually.. many !! Huh..  :P ;) Anyways, I wish you all the very best for a bright future ahead and I know you will have one because you deserve it all..!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>
<p>The ultimate dude of hostel reasons- He has connections with Nasik ! This chap I remember in the first days of hostel life cribbing about getting IS with Pranky, but defending it gracefully, I hope you have realised IS was better than this. A good football player who loves Manchester United, sadly yes. The personality he carries is charismatic and surely fun to hang out with him in common room during those matches ( dont predict you always fail). A stud galli cricket player who thinks he is the best fielder forgets Bapu ! His shouts or those lame jokes I have heard from him are memories to cherish. Sadly I dint attend any classes so no class memories, but yeah that presentation we had I dont remember the subject name in 3-1, where we sat played KBC, ate lays in class and had fun for a change in Maths class shall be missed. Awesome work in Quark for DePP to make it a grand success, the appreciation your work gets from your juniors speaks volumes for your dedication towards work, sadly I dint get to work with you. 
I hope we have fun next year full of labs and assignments with the Ranchi dude showing off along with us. Do help me with assignments and whatever shit, coz you were awesome telling me to read this and that just moments before exam with which I atleast managed to not get a zero. That performance at Zephyr shall be missed but something new shall come up the next Zephyr :P ( I want to do something next time).  Had a great time with you man, hope you real greater heights and achieve your goals.

PS. Assignments submit karne ke pehle please do check if I did or not for next year.

<p>Shreyans ....I met this guy during the coco orientation for Quark 2012 .........we never spoke much .........but surprisingly whenever we did it was as if we had been good friends for years ..........was very good at his work during quark(no matter what others say ...u did your work very well,.....:))...nowadays we ping each other only for "essential" commodity in the middle of the night ......but now that we will stay in the same hostel on the same floor i expect to have greater interaction with him in the coming sem ........!!All the best for you life ahead ......:)!!!

<p>One of my first football buddies in campus. Had so much fun playing for AH-4 and BITSFC together and wining so much. Will never forget our slam and BPL victories! Off the field he's a great guy, always supportive and helpful. Had fun supporting united together in the common room! Looking forward to the one sem of football left after i come back from PS. Keep in touch man. Wishing you success in your future! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
