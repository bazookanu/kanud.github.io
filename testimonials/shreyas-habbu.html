<p>Habbu - Another person to be summoned by his surname May be I am the one of the few people who calls him Shreyas... A "public figure" he is with respect and honor and gratitude...  Say the name and you get a huge happy looking figure in front of you... Has a unique style and gait (and also size) and can thus be identified from far off... A perfect example of SIZE DOES MATTER... !!! A happy go lucky person who always helps out people in their work... An excellent Vice President for the BITS Goa Campus... Currently I would say the most famous person across the campus... My best Backstage buddy... Had some awesome moments with you in the department... A person who loves Chemistry from the bottom of his heart. (Has a vast knowledge about it).. And he is a big PRO in Organic chemistry... I remember the first year when it was like chemistry classes going on in his room where around 6-7 people used to sit and solve problems and he was there for all the doubts.....One of the people I never fail to visit whenever I am at his hostel... A person whom you can find many a times in the night canteen at A mess... May be you will bump into him every single time you go... A crazy lover of food... Probably loves food more than girls... :P ... A cool friend to hang out with ... I remember those days when we used to play fifa, tt, cards, etc... Oh ... and how can I forget his unique voice which is always at its 100% loudness... Also his epic laughter  which is easily identifiable from anywhere can never be forgotten...A person with high dreams...  A nice friend to sit and chitchat for long hours.. (Even though sometimes he happens to bluff things... :P)... Very calm and cool headed person generous at heart.... (Except that he is not at all generous at giving his food to you... :P) Thanks to be one of the best friends that bumped into my life... You will be never forgotten... !!! All the best for your future...

<p>Shreyas!! One of my +2 friends who made it here with me. Always smiling, extremely hard working, passionate about chemistry. We had a blast during our +2 days... I will never forget all those nights we spent at his place playing poker and teen-patti :D.... Shreyas is also one of the "sankya bashers" along with me :P.... 
Be it hanging around after class, or be it studying, Shreyas has always been there. Always. He is also one of the most helpful people I have had the fortune of knowing. Forever generous and always ready to help. If I started sharing anecdotes, my testimonial will grow too long, so I'll just say this: You have been and always will be one of the awesomest friends I have ever made. Cheers, and Good Luck mate!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>

<p>Habbuuuu...
My Dear Friend, Did not know u much in my frst 2 years. But third year was Awesome.
Couldn't have asked for a Better Vice Prez and a frnd in CSA. Always there to help 
anyone in need, jovial and spreading smiles to others :).
All those meetings, Night Outs (Esp the quark one :P), COCO discusion meetings would have been incomplete without you.You simply Cant say no to frnds can you? :P that's one awesome quality, Dont loose it :) .
.You always stood by me and helped me throughout :) thank you for that. The Encyclopedia of our Campus,U seriously astonish me with your observation skills. Just be strong and optimistic like you always are.
Thank you for everythyn. All the very Best for your future :). And do stay in Touch( You must :p ) . CHeers :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshith-rao-yethapu">Akshith Rao Yethapu</a></p>
<p>A 150kg monster who laughs as if he has conquered the whole world. But this chap is that poor simple kid at heart who loves to help his friends in every aspect of it. He is just like a elder brother to me, be it helping me in acads, taking me to mess for food ( I dint like mess food at times) or even shouting on me for some stupid habits of mine. The perfect momma's boy who respects elders and provides that warmth when you ask him for help. I remember that POM paper, when I had come drunk just a day prior to paper and hadnt studied anything, he saw to it that I sleep in Ashesh's room, woke me 5-6 hrs prior to paper gave me food shouted on me to have bath and made me study, I got good marks in POM changed my grade from C to B, he is like a family to me. Sharing doubts, troubles or good events he gives you the perfect reactions and solutions to them. Being one of the most famous guys on campus, he is down to earth and loves hanging out with people, you can see him sitting with juniors or seniors at Ice n Spice or Jhopdi and with another set of people at Mongi, his friends know him what a truly entertaining person he is. He has always stood for the right be what the consequences be and I appreciate that and request you dont change that attitude. I remember nites before Waves, when I was lazy to get permissions and things working in my favour, he would sit with me help me out and saw to it that things were on time and perfect.
When things werent working fine for me, he would advice me and get my work done, thanks a lot for the help man ! In Waves, when I had to face some serious problems, he stood up and took the responsibility and asked me to rest, this attitude and kindness is what defines Habbu and separates him from the general lot. I can say this with confidence that If not you then this Waves would have been a lot sad coz many things needed help from CSA and you were always ready to help and take up initiatives.. thanks ! 
Life's been awesome till now and I hope you shall achieve all those goals you have set. I want you to be happy always like u are and also get thin MAN ! ( Dont be an inspire to your kids :P ). 
Staying in contact and rest isnt what I ask for, coz we shall be in contact I know that :P . 
I am proud of your work as the Honest VP of campus, you have stood up and worked and showed people its hard work and not some attitude which wins. 
Please lets go out and get drunk once before compre ? :P 
All the best wishes for you and stop eating and concentrate on your belly !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Habbu as called by everyone on campus is one of the most impressive and popular VP seen by BPGC. He works hard or maybe i should say a little too hard. Back when he worked more for backstage he was so dominating that even my batchmates came complaigning "man that guy is too dominating"  ( i would say great work :P ). An evergreen personality with an amusing and humble behaviour and so is loved by all. He is also a great foodie.  Best luck for future habbu :)

<p>HABBU... one of the nicest guys I have ever met... Man this guy knows everything on campus...not all of it may be true :P... but he'll always extend his hand to help you. If you see him u'll feel scared of him but this guy is extremely humble and kind. His room has been the 'general store' of our hostel... books, stationary, medicine, u name it .. he has it. And most importantly ... FOOD which he is never short of because he loves to eat. He can eat more 
food than I eat in a day. I look at him and always feel this guy will make a great politician. He has always been a popular guy on campus and knows everyone... no matter which year they're in. I wish him all the best in the world... Habbu always be the humble and kind and smiling person ur are. Thanks for being a great friend.!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-sathe">Gaurav Sathe</a></p>
<p>Habbu!! His surname is so unique that i forgot his real name and was mentioning him as "Habbu" to faculty and when they corrected me by saying "Shreyas" i couldnt understand until it hit me :P I worked along with him as Mess Convener with him being the VP. He gladly gave me a free role in the mess, while providing me valuable inputs. This guy looks and acts as every bit of a politician. Visible every night in NC, he has been a great friend through these years acting as a source of campus gossip, common-sense approach and he always had my back. We have Mech next year together. Looking forward to an awesome 4th year with you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>Habbu, one of the very good friends i gained during quark 2012. Apparently the hottest chick in the campus finds him cute( :P) , he is always willing to help and a great company. He keeps smiling and makes others smile too. He has a been part of CSA and has done his part in an exemplary way. You have been so co-operative in the last one year and thanks for that!! Keep smiling and stay the way you are!! stay in touch!! . All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>Habbu!! the shan, the jaan of our corridor and of our campus. He was actually the first person I met on campus when we came for the 4th iteration. From that day on I knew as an awesome guy and a very helpful friend(he actually made my first ever coffee in life :P). He is really passionate about the things he like and there's is nothing that bothers him or that can make him sad. He knows how to live life to the fullest. His principles, his positive attitude, his attitude, his nature and his desire are out of this world. I think he can be a very good role model and has proved it during his tenure as the VP (but kutte ne abhi tak HQ mein party nahi diya).  With the skills that he has he can be a very good leader and a good orator. All the best habbu i'll miss you man but don't ever change the way you are and keep in touch....Cheers!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>Shreyas Gururaj Habbu. This guy lived right opposite me and yet I didn't know his name for at least a couple of weeks until I had to ask him at Nescafe. I guess that was because he came in later and we were already hanging out in separate groups. Not to mention his time-table back in those days. I could speak about how he's the information center of the campus, how he knows almost every living soul there is around here, how he is so very friendly with everyone and how he commands a lot of respect from anyone who meets him, but then what's the point of living right opposite a guy if you treat him exactly the same way everyone else does? From being a studious, disciplined guy who'd go to sleep latest by 11 PM and wake up every morning by 5:30 AM to one couldn't even be found in his room at 2 AM, watching him change and gel with college life over these years has been great. From being against any loud sounds to getting his own 2.1 speakers, from spending 2 weeks in the library prior to any tests and exams to multiple pre-compre E's, from no aerated drinks for years to finishing my coke and thums ups all the time, a lot has changed in him since he first came here, except maybe the fact that he's still sweet guy, a child at heart and a great friend! I've been lucky enough to be among the few people who've seen him during his lows and when he lost confidence and it has been an honor that I've been considered close enough. :) 
It was an amazing and intense week campaigning for him and I got one of the biggest adrenaline rushes I've had when this guy became the vice president. And despite what anyone says, I know first hand how he worked his ass off during his tenure and gave as much as he possibly could  to the campus. And even though he's one of the most popular people on campus, once he's in the corridor, he's the same old friend I've always had. Habbus, don't you dare go out of touch once we're outta here and stay the same confident, happy-go-lucky guy you've been until now. I don't need to wish the best for your life ahead, well mainly because there's a hell lot of time we still have to spend here and because I know I'll be there in the future to wish you good luck when you need it. Cheers to AH4 - 249.5! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>Sheryas Habbu or habooobs!! :P My elder brother... he is one of the nicest guyz i have ever met.. hard working,dedicated, and most importantly someone upon whom you can trust blindly and share everything you want to...
always has a smile on his face and ensures that others around him are smiling too... I met him in 2-1 and since then we have become very good friends.. this news maker has all the news of the campus... very passionate guy and there is nothing that can stop him from doing whatever he wants..can go to any extend to help his friends... his work as the Vice President was commendable and I hope someday i will be as dedicated and hard working as he is...  in my first year when i didn't knew him i thought he was the backstage coordi by looking at the amount of work he used to do in organizing any event in the audi... :P 
My mentor, my guru and my God father in each and every sense... thanks for helping us when we needed it the most and thanks being so caring and most importantly thanks for making us smile :)
I hope  the smile remains on your face forever and you achieve success in whatever you do in future... :)
Your lovingly

<p>Me and Shreyas (yes, I belong to the minority of ppl who call him that :P) went to the same coaching class in +2, but I came to know him well only after coming here. I feel his name (habbu) suits very well to his personality :P He was a very apt choice for the role of Ganesha in 1st year MM performance. The time spent in the practice for culturals and also during and after pooja in SAC and then special lunch in A mess is memorable... A very friendly, hardworking and practical person… He has been a very popular (some jnrs call him ‘habbu bhaiya’ :D ) and well deserved VP of our campus. A fond lover of food.. I don’t think he ever denies going to any eatery anytime.. Be it mongi, mess,  shahi or nc ... You will always be remembered, Shreyas! Wish you a very successful and happy life ahead :) P.S.: At least I dint have to travel for hours in passenger train to reach my PS station :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Habbudi, Babbuda Jaddya.... This guy has been one of my closest friends on the campus. And this is before he became the Very Very Popular Vice Prez of the campus. The rolly polly of the campus is truly loved by all and I will tell you why. He is an humble human being, always ready to help,give out some excellent advices(sometimes not needed :P) and be a gentleman (obviously only to the ladies)...  He shares food.. Wait no  Erase that.... He doesnt share it with me in the night canteen especially :P The ever hungry man ,he constantly likes to eat something or the other and you can find a great stock in his room almost every day. I know I m talking about his eating a lot but that does make about 70 percent of his life :P  ... Just kidding.. So what I have learnt about this being is he is a great friend to have because he values his friends very highly and is a person you can bank on whenever in any difficulty. Now, there are perks of being  a vice prez and I would say shamelessly that I used them quite a bit to my own advantage ;).. As a vice prez, though he was wonderful as a coordinator, managing to look after the campus fests with ease, as an administrator with reference to the certain things being brought to the campus couldn't be fulfilled by him. But I won't blame him because he gave his 200 percent effort and the effort is all that matters to me. I do feel sad for him because he himself would be regretting not being able to complete everything on his agenda.. But kudos to him for being the best vice prez of our campus during my stay here. On a ending note, I just love his friendship and I hope it remains the same  no matter what .. And ya Habbu .. just in case u think of being a politician... ." Hum tumhare saath hain,, Aage badho " :P :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohan-heemanshu-kawley">Rohan Heemanshu Kawley</a></p>
<p>Okay i remember meeting you from the mess committee meeting in my first year.. that's where we first met.... And then have always seen you doing something or the other for Backstage....  then we met during our CSA elections and being good friends after that... 

You can easily recognize habbu from miles away ... :P You can find him most of the time hanging around Monginis with a cup of double coffee..... 

The most dedicated guy i must say on campus... whatever he does it is always with full dedication..  100% devotion to what he loves...  This guy know everything happening in campus .. whether it is some thing in administration or  some random gossip amongst the juniors or seniors...  He knows it all.. The campus encyclopedia ...  i always wonder how do you get so much of info... :P

As the Vice president of campus 2011-2012 .. he has done a wonderful job... always ready to take any duty any work at any time.... Had some of the best times with you this entire year in CSA room ... all that random chudaap we used to do... playing Fruit Ninja on Manoj's Ipad or working for the fest.... it was awesome... Ohh and not to forget the CoCo meetings... Awesome time we had ...  All the bogmalo outing we had.... and the coco outings... it was all fun.....
 Thank you for being with us always... i dont remember getting a NO for anything from you.. you would always their to help me out...

And you lucky bastard ... finally you got relieved of Chemistry :P ... 

I wish for the best in your life .. and achieve the utmost success in all your endeavors .. And be in touch always.....  :)

<p>Habbu, my BIGGEST friend. Has always been there whenever needed. He is the first person who will start taking my case about anything at all. He has brilliant gait when he walks (recognizable from across the campus). Its fun talking to him, because he always has some gossip about stuff happening on campus, sometimes even fake but worth listening anyways. He is an extreme food lover. When on a so called diet, he won't take anything in the mess but won't budge to let his hand into your plate and grab a bite. Worked very well during his tenure as the Vice Prez. gave me a few hard times but was worth it. This guy probably knows every living sole on campus be it the faculty, the hostel assistants, the students, even a few guards. Extremely skillful at most things he does. 
Don't change. Be the down-to-earth and awesome human being you are. Never lose your size, that is your brand :P.  Be in touch and All the best for your future. May you achieve whatever you wish in life. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tanmay-binaykiya">Tanmay Binaykiya</a></p>
