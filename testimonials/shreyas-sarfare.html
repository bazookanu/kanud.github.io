<h1 class="page-title">Shreyas Sarfare</h1><p>Before  i say anything else in my opinion this is the only guy in the AOE playing bunch of our batch who i think has a real shot at getting a girl (after i-con of course ):P
Was my PS1 buddy and a fellow mechie. Its always fun to hangout with him. Hoping u have a great future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>Shreyas is one of the most chilled out guys you'll meet in ur life. He takes lite in the true sense of the word. Attends 0 classes, doesnt start studying till there are less than 12 hours left for the exam, and he still does pretty decent for the amount of effort he puts. He's my aoe clan mate, and a damn good aoe player, has won us so many matches single-handedly( _/\_ mayans :D ). One thing about him, to which any1 who knows him will agree is he NEVER says no. Does not mean that he can be forced to do whatever you want or shit, just that he won't say no. So many times, I tried getting him to class, and the reply I used to get was "Tu jaa, main aata hu" or "haan, dekhta hu", but not once did he ever turn up. An ardent watcher of tv-series, he has watched many of them. Once he starts watching one, he completes them at a rate of 1 season per day or something. He has an excellent sense of humour, constantly making ppl around him laugh at something or the other. Wish u all the best for ur future, u better stay in touch with me ( dont $#@* ), else u r dead :P.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-chandramouli">Varun Chandramouli</a></p>
<p>Shreyas aka Galba aka Zarroc aka Sh****r (bura mat maan-na censor kiya hai) is one of the best AOE players of our year. He doesnt attend a single class of any subject ( unless there is some evaluative component :P ) but he will go for every paper distribution :D. He sometimes tells me to wake him up , but often falls asleep immediately after. Every time i call him for class his reply will always be "Tu nikal, main aata hu" and he would never come.
He is the only one i know (besides myself) who watches Tv series continuously, ( watched 1 season of 24 per day :respect: man) . We have had some really awesome times together, be it our regular trips to nc, or the timepass we do in someones room. one of my best friends in BITS. Hope  u have a great future. stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/param-prabhu-alvenkar">Param Prabhu Alvenkar</a></p>
