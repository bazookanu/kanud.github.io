<p>Shruthi Srinivas is a young intelligent woman. She looks more like a professional lawyer. Yeah, never told you that  And that is a compliment! She is a very good friend and always helpful. She is really great as a team member with really awesome ideas. Her creativity and soft skills are really good. Her presentation and designing skills are very stupendous. This I know because she was with me in the CIMA GBC team. The best thing about her is that she is really patient and always ready to work. She is really diligent and no matter how sick she is, she would always find time to work on the important things. Best things - Dedication, Soft skills, Designing, Creativity and of course Intelligence<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Shruthi the best thing about you is you never give up things and fight it till the last moment, people with such qualities are really hard to find and you manage your things extremely well.You really have a great patience, i still remember those CIMA days where you used to listen to our craziest ideas without loosing your cool  and tolerate those music wars never irritated you, you are a superb person to work with and a really trust worthy friend . You are one of the finest telugu girls i had ever met in my life .Keep going in the same same way no matter what ppl say , wish you all the success in future :)))

<p>It was during the FUFA classes that I came to know Shruthi was in economics ( I hardly attended POE classes so i din't knew :P ). I had heard from my fellow Eco friends that she had taken a shift to Eco.....so obviously very high CG.....and after hearing that I thought you must be one of those 'Nerdy' types :P But I was so wrong!! During the Palolem trip I realized what a fun and jolly person she was to be around. She keeps a perfect balance between Studies and Enjoyment - a very tough job for everyone to accomplish. I am sure a bright future awaits you :) P.S. -  You have got a great smile :) Always keep that smile on and  stay in touch even after Eco is over! All the Best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Shruthi is extremely graceful & has a fantastic smile!.. She has the  "intelligent " genes & extremely high determination to driving her to success in  everything....! Multitasking & acing things is a habit for her!...... She is jolly ,friendly & fun to be around !Palolem trip was great fun........! She helps whenever in need ! Respect increases for her when you see that she also takes out time for social work! the respect will further increase if she  gives atleast one of the many pending treats :P :)  ....Hope next year is even more awsum &  more fun !

<p>Beautiful, charming, intelligent, sophisticated, Hardworking, consistent, dedicated, determined, humble - one almost runs out of adjectives while describing Shruthi.  I Have known her for nearly 5 years, and there have been quite a few unforgettable (for lack of a better word :P) incidents. Resembles Priyanka Chopra but would never accept it. After almost every exam, she would claim it didnâ€™t go well yet invariably ends up acing it. An extremely genuine and innocent person at heart, she can be really sensitive when you need someone to talk to. I wish u all the very best for your future and hope that we stay in touch. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arjun-mathew-eranacal">Arjun Mathew Eranacal</a></p>

<p>Shruthi is one of the most intelligent and hardworking girls I came across in BITS !!! Its very evident from her performance in Thermo in 1-1. Sweet  and charming she can make  a place in anyone's heart instantly. In my first year I used to confuse you with gargi :P I will miss all the late night talks we had about various topics :P ,the awesome trips we had and the birthdays we celebrated. The first time I evr went to Vasco was on ur B'day and we had great fun der. All the Best for your future ahead and with you will definitely make it big in life. Keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sonali-bhadra">Sonali Bhadra</a></p>
<p>Shruthi! I met her on the second day of my arrival on campus. We roamed the streets of BPGC chatting around. She was in Bio then. Then came the 4th or 5th iteration. She got B4! I am proud to say that I was a part of her 'OMG-which-branch-is-B4? What-is-the-B4? moment' We kept on guessing, but to no avail. Thank God it wasn't Physics ;)
Then she got B3 at the end of the year. And Whoo! we sure had a lot of fun in Eco since then! Whether it was assignments or solving random doubts or just gossiping away about 
random stuff or re-iterating 'Tell me YOUR story! :P' It was fun each time. Every time. Shruthi is one of the most helpful and nicest people I know. We share the same sorrow of inward facing rooms. Indiafest and Palolem trips were great fun, weren't they?
Stay the same and don't change at all!
