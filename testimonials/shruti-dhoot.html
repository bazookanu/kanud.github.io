<h1 class="page-title">Shruti Dhoot</h1><p>Here I quote from a conversation with a Dear Friend 
"There are many fish in the sea, but a pearl is rare."
This person is here is one of the rarest gems you will ever find. 
There is always that look of curiousity, the enthusiasm to learn and also sometimes  
a little twitch on the nose when something seems to be out of place.
She is a person who epitomizes consistent hard work and continues it irrespective
of the circumstances. There is always that beautiful smile which just says to you,
"Isn't the world a wonderful place." That I believe is one emotion which comes from
a complete understanding of life's worth and strong belief in one's values. She has
very strong principles, which is evident from her approach towards life, a quality which seems to become rarer in the world by the day.
I am thankful to Almighty for giving me an oppurtunity to know such a great person.
I will always cherish the memory of this wonderful human being.

<p>A lot of people know about the hard-working side of Shruti, so lemme highlight some other aspects of her life which i know and cherish....she is level-headed and mature when it comes to studies but sometimes she has this childlike personality which I simply adore; getting excited over simple things, being insanely happy when all we friends get together, thrilled to do girly stuff :) ...shes also one of the few people who laugh at my jokes :D ....She's ready to try various things....tends to be timid at times....she has plans and sticks to them....she's a great inspiration to me...Way To Go!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-repal">Neha Repal</a></p>
<p>Shruti Dhoot, one of my best frenz on campus.. 1st v met ws in LC-101, during our registrations but  our good old habit of last minute study during exams brought us close. It was back in 1-2 whn she helped me in every possible way academically, n slowly the friendship grew. Since then, i ve known shruti as MY best fren! Although she is awarded th Nerd Queen of the '09 batch, I'd put her the in the category of studious n hard working, yet fun ( only if u r lucky enuf 2 kno her in person ). Shruti is the sweetest fren i ve eva had! Altho v r best frenz, she is very very formal (evn wit me,yes!) and well mannered(somethin i shud learn from her). She is very passionate about wateva she does ( n to those ignorant ppl who call her a nerd, she s crazy about TV series n watches em non stop)! Dance lover! and I must mention tat she is a patient listener. Probably, thats one reason, v get along so well! Her english vocabulary is amazing and she writes very well ( I give her credits to all my essays submitted for various applications).. V ve shared good times n bad times 2geder.. I've hurt u at times n probably ve been der 4 u whneva i cud, bt u r the BEST fren i cud possibly make on campus n m truly gonna miss these days spent wit u.. Will never forget the fun v had while doing little things lik tryin 2 walk 2 vasco, or our crazy bogamo trips or th times whn v shared rooms ( bed bugs :X) Cheers to all those memories!! Love you :*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ranjita-pai-kasturi">Ranjita Pai Kasturi</a></p>

<p>Shruti -It takes hours to search a dictionary to find words to describe her.The dictionary has words like passionate,focused,hard working but it fails to find a proper blend of all these attributes rightly intact in a single one,perhaps they could do away with a new one-"Shrutied"!! Kudos to her efforts,in setting higher benchmarks for herself and leaving no stone unturned in fulfilling those dreams,she just aces everything that comes in her path to success. As a friend ,she is amazing, I have never seen such a keen listener,you can go on and on and she wouldn't complaint.At times when u are off the track,she would act as a teacher with a cane-ready to point out your mistakes ,so that you improve the next time and I just love this quality.She is fun to hang with,no one else appreciates my jokes as much she does(They really are bad and awful).Sweetness,gentleness,humbleness-she is a down to earth person,who has great respect for her companions. Shruti-Even the sky isnt the limit for you,wish you great success in life.Keep smiling,All the best :)   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
<p>Shruti! Even though i didn't get to hang around with you as much, or spend that much time with you but every time i did, it was truly amazing. I still remember that one time when i was extremely bored at the Mumbai airport and we bumped into each other  and the whole while we waited for the plane we had an awesome gossiping session. You are an extremely sweet, caring, helpful person  & truly a girl next door ;).  All the best for future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-sharma">Arushi Sharma</a></p>
<p>Think of Shruti, and you will most probably be reminded of her childlike exuberant persona, her infectious smile and her sweetly engaging conversational abilities. However, dig deep into this facade, and you will find a whole new dimension of wonderful solid personality- generous and caring, imminently likable and humble, completely open hearted, emphatic and charming. Not to mention, her complete (and testified :P) utter genius and ability to sweat it out!
I met her one year ago in PS-1. Though we have never been the most talkative of people,  I feel that I share a warm camaraderie with her. She can just "connect" so well with anybody- with nothing more than her innocence-personified-in-sound voice, her happydent approved smile and one of her well timed emphatic "i knowwwww"s ! One conversation with her and you'll either forget your worries, or feel so good about them that they won't remain worries at all !
I just hope to carry forward this valuable friendship throughout our lives, no matter where we go and what we become !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-palnitkar">Aditya Palnitkar</a></p>
<p>Shruti - its been a pleasure getting to know her. She's a really sweet and down-to-earth person. She's the most helpful person i know of, would have flunked most of my cdcs without her notes :P Not very good with words, so wont go on for long. I hope we stay in touch. Best of luck for all your endeavours.  God bless :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniruddha-gangopadhyay">Aniruddha Gangopadhyay</a></p>
