<p>One of the special friends of mine. Someone with whom i haven't interacted to a great extent but whatever opportunity we had to spent some time together was just great. The ever present smile on her face and her bubbly nature is admirable indeed. Calm, composed and also someone who works hard to achieve her goals, she is truly amazing and what is even more amazing is the way she enjoys the little things in life which in today's life is such a great quality to posses. That 4-5 min chat on Delhi airport is something i won't forget, the excitement and happiness on your face that day to be home was so cute :P. I just wish with one more year left on the campus, may be we get some more time to spend together :). Knowing you has just been great and i wish all the best for your future and i am sure you will scale the heights of success one day. God Bless!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>Shruti is one of my most unique friends gifted with bubbling enthusiasm. She is a strong willed person , once she sets a goal to achieve she would stop until she gets there. Her enthusiasm and bubbly nature is always a turn on for people around her. She is a person I should say has evolved so much from a childish momma's baby ;) to a super confident girl.  Wherever you go you'll have great future . Wish you all the best and will certainly remember your homely treats :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Shruti is the 1st friend i have made on this campus :D ... The gal who was crazy about cartoons and chocolates! Bedsheet se lekar tshirt tak everything had cartoons over it :D and drawer used to be full of chocolates!! whenever i used to go to her room... she used to cutely tell me "hey i know i should share this chocolate with you... par yaar, ek hi hai; aur mujhe aadha shaam ko khana hai. Sorry" Very colorful nature. Within the whole chaos... something she never misses is having fun! She is unexhausting factory of doubts... wont leave you till she understands every bit of the damn topic. You can never get bored around her. She is 24 hours pumped with life .... radiating mirthful energy around her :) At times kiddish.. but a keen learner. Keeps adding quality to her thoughts.. knowledge .. every moment. Be the way you are Shruti .... and i am sure... success, happiness and prosperity will follow you:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/archana-naphade">Archana Naphade</a></p>
<p>She is the most enthusiastic and the CRAZIEST (:-*) of all my friends in campus. Life would have been so boring and monotonous had she not been there. She can talk all day about anything and everything on Earth. She is very good at heart, helping, a little childish and values friendship to a great extent (especially mine :P ). Shruti, my bio lectures would never have been the same without you. You would go on writing those small, cute and crazy stuff ( about our love :-*) in my notebook and I would reply only for the sake of it ( :P)! I love those expressions you used to give me! And the one u you used to give when I would go on shaking my legs and accidently ( or maybe intentionally) kick you…I can never forget it. It’s the most memorable one for me. Somebody who will wild away most of her time (don’t mind) and sits down to study at the last moment but still manages to score pretty well ?. She loves watching tv series, listening to music, dancing, going out and can capture every second of her life in camera if she could! A very humble person who is ready to accept her mistakes and change herself as per your needs      ( this is her best quality). Acknowledges others and is very social, and tries teaching me the same but ob it doesn’t work out and we end up in the arguments which are forgotten in seconds ?. Also a big fan of makeup and dressing up. Will hardly step out of the room without her kajal, sunscreen and deo. We have had loads of funny, silly arguments but double the number of hugs!! ? will miss both of them.. I really do treasure our friendship and love ....love you..take care..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>
<p>Friendly. Bubbly. Caring. Ever-smiling. Childish. She is also of the warmest persons I know on the campus. The amount of energy she has is in her those big eyes is infectious. She is fun to be around and has such a carefree attitude, which again makes her look like she is just gonna burst with energy. She is a chattebox but a good listner too :) You can have talks with her with just about anything for whatever time you want.
It's a pleasure to be her friend, and I wish you All The Best for your future. 
May you go and do what you want :)
PS.: Phir milenge. pucca :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>I first met you in Delhi while PS1. It was a great fun hanging out in Delhi and doing projects there. On campus we've not talked much. You're very friendly, extrovert and willing to mix up with people around you. I wish you best of luck for all your future endeavors.. Have a great life ahead..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

<p>Shrutiiiiiii..... dunno where to start from... it all started with my trying to save your life (from a  lizard :P ).. it has been amazing having you in my life....I will never forget the endless gossips, disturbing you while you were watching "Vampire Diaries", playing ninjump on your phone(am yet to make the high score though :D ),the awesome trips with you, getting shocked finding about another similarity between us and so much more.. You are so sweet,childish in your own way , a little mature in a few things, and so loud all the time (I really pity your neighbours ;) ) But you are an amazing person and extremely innocent and good at heart. You know what is right for you and you will surely do great in life...and am not wishing you all the best for your future etc etc because I know  I will be with you whenever you will need it,... :-* Just stay cheerful, and happy always. 
P.S.- Atleast,till the time our bora bora plan doesn't get executed, m not leaving you.. ;) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srishti-maitre">Srishti Maitre</a></p>
<p>One girl that can beat me in talking is shruti... very chirpy, cute, happy, and way too far from common people... She has her small world, in which everything is sweet and nice... mama’s girl...  loves her family a lot... got to know her in 1-1, which was not soo gud.. ( rem you always used to make fun of me.. ob.. u still do..)... n I was so whiny... She is always very excited about everything, loves to be in photos, loves crowd, dancing and masti... she is very pretty ( just love her big expressive eyes)... had an awesome time together in preeti’s room, loved the way you used to get things specially for us from your home... ( Kaju ki barfi, mathri and everything..)... One person who has seriously grown in these three years is shruti... much more mature and sophisticated now... Her cleanliness campaign PLAN starts everyday (or better to say every night)... and next day you go to her room, its still the same... Lost in LOST and vampire diaries, loves page 3 news, and loves to wear rings... Extremely sensitive.. fun-loving person.. Remember our Palolem trip... ( an awesome experience... including bus.. :P)... gets conscious of little things... a typical girl...as Preeti said.. never comes out of her room without her kaajal, deo and etc, etc.. things... loves shopping... She finds happiness in everything (the video you made for your brother was amazing)... very optimistic... Shruti is fun-to-be with, you have to talk about anything... shruti is one person you can count upon....  A child at heart... ( and behaviour as well.. :P)... shruti is one who can keep secrets... Smart, cheerful, Happy-go-lucky (kabhi kabhi..)... the list just goes on... be happy and the way as you are.... an amazing friend... and an amazing person... Love you... take care... :).. :-*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>

<p>Shruti aka drosophila (recently changed her name  :P) .  we first met in workshop  since then she is one of my  best friend ( really ? :P :D ). I remembered the date  april 13 ,2010 in the workshop , we were doing fitting exp and  priyanka  was waving her hands at  me to wish u (that’s ur b’day :P)  and  omkar  was waving his hands at  priyanka to wish me (yaa its my b’day  too :P ) that was best moment and  i will never forget  that  incident .we had lot fun during the workshop me and pradyumn used to tease (not eve teasing if u r mistaken :P)  u too girls (sir ,again under dimension :P :P ) .
 At any given point of time u can find either find her  laughing (not smiling only loud laughing :P) or sad  for no reason  :D . if u want to try new jokes u can choose shruti as ur experimental material (:P) she will never mind . very fun loving and determined (only at studies :P ). Soon she is going change her address to Punjab and her bank account to Punjab national bank (:P) (do call us  for ur wedding :P ) .very less sense of humour and very high sense of irritating ppl ( :P ). I really  enjoyed all  the fun (and non fun :P ) talking with  you all the time in mess, labs ,g talk :D . she is very good at taking advices and implementing  them in real life .
I know u will never forget me and vice versa . Because we born on same day and  we will be celebrating same day at diff places every year   (u will at least remember me  once a year :D).
All the best for your future  ... keep smiling ...and as always said take li8 some issues u will be more happy   :D .

<p>Shruti is such a lovely person to know, always smiling and cheerful. I have known her since my first year and since then its been a beautiful journey. I have seen her grow as a person from being the one who would panic always and will be such a cry baby to such a confident person as she is now. And her smile is a winner...Keep it always. Wish you all the best sweetheart :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Shruttiiii!!! Hahahaha! Yaar ye bandi gajjab hai! Bas hasati hai! Extremely innocent and very chirpy, combine that with an awesome smile and u have shruti garg! Iske bare mein kya bol sakte hain, bas character hai bahot badi, thodi confused si hoti hai, yet she has a lot to do in life. Has quite high morals in life and also values friends a lot. Iske aas paas ho to hamesha iske saath kuch keede karne ka mann hota hai, fir ghumkar hasegi aur bolegi “kya kar rha hai? Maaru kya?” aur style maarne ki koshish karegi, in vain though. She has a very soft heart aur shayad hi zindagi mein ek machhar bhi maara hoga :P but jab hasti hai, ekdum mast lagti hai! So always keep smiling! And best of luck for life! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-h-narielwala">Parth H Narielwala</a></p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK! ... whos there?.... a pot full of gossip and fun! 
Thats Shruti for you guys! 
She comes, she sees, she snatches it from your hand and has her way with it :P Now that i think about it, what haven’t we done together? Trying your stilettos and strutting our asses off! The bitching, the cribbing and the ranting. One or two epic DJ nights and every single of the birthday parties! The epic love–letter prank me and Gargi played on you! You name it, we have been there, done that.
It is one of the ironies of life that we become close and then it is time to move on, I’ll probably never come to terms with it. But I know you will just be a ping away! All the best for your future!

<p>Shruti! I think of her and a big smile spreads over my face :) . Exuberant, fun-loving and always happy, her cheerful mood is very infectious and even if one is feeling down, talking to her will definitely cheer them up. There is absolutely no scope of boredom, when she is around. Bold and daring, she makes friends after doing a lot of filtering process, but once they are her friends…..she cares  for them unconditionally….it was very heart touching, when you came with your mom to meet me……remember the talk we had …. (n that realization u had about me  :) , I seriously want you to be the next person experiencing that ?:) ). The thing which I love most about her is her pure, unselfish heart….She would not hesitate to call a spade a spade and wouldn’t mind being frank at you face, a virtue which is quite rare these days…….love u …will cherish all my moments spent with u  ……all the best for your future ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akansha-suneria">Akansha Suneria</a></p>
