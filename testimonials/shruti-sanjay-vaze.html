<h1 class="page-title">Shruti Sanjay Vaze</h1><p>Like many of the testimonials, let me start with where I met my friend.. I first met her in CC in the registration queue, and i was so glad I finally found someone from chemical.. hardly did i know back then that this person will become my best buddy in campus. She is hard-working, caring, good at acads (not a nerd!!) and has this weird quality(i admire it though) of getting up at any time and studying in the night (during exam)... She will spend lot of time with friends, watching movies, tv series or just 'tp'ing, and still manage to study more than me (always!! :O).. Coming to exams.. she gets tensed during exams even though she knows everything.. She will say her paper was 'ok' (she hardly uses 'good', coz she thinks that she would have definitely made some mistake :P) and if she tops the subjects, her reaction is.. 'paper was easy, i dint do anything great'.. She is very very trust-worthy and a very sensible person.. A very down to earth, simple n sweet friend..  And how can i forget, one of the most active Nirmaan Goa members (Manjuri ma'am is always searching for her :D :D) So used to her company that it feels weird if she plans to bunk and i m attending (rarely happens coz we bunk together :D).. On weekends, it takes some time to realize that she has gone home and I dnt have to call her for lunch/dinner..  She finds any random thing funny and laughs her heart out at it (just like me :P :D).. We have had insane laughs for no reason (sometimes even during lectures :P)... and we just start laughing bcoz the other person is laughing.. and the loop continues till our stomach n cheeks start hurting... We still have a semester together and if we are lucky enough we may get one more and i am sure we will enjoy it to the fullest... This testimonial cannot express completely what our friendship is (or i m not able to express)... Thats all for nw :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Vaze, as she is fondly called by everyone, is one of the most amazing persons i have met on campus. Friendly, cheerful, calm, composed, trust-worthy .... (the list will never end) are few qualities that set her apart! The days i have spent on campus with her , especially as a part of Nirmaan goa will be cherished forever! Somehow manages to strike a perfect balance between acads and other activities. 
She is more than a senior.. She is a sister!
Wishing you a very bright future ahead!! All the best!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/venkata-yaji">Venkata Yaji</a></p>
<p>Shruti is one of the sweetest and nicest persons on campus. Most of our interactions were in the Electrical Lab, where she seemed to be perpetually afraid I might blow something up. That was pretty hilarious, on one hand there was the instructor screaming at me and on the other hand was Shruti politely asking me to “shut up”. Thank you for making those labs a bit bearable!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>Nobby..!!!...its time you begin accepting this nick, seriously...:P :P...just the magnitude of reaction i get for calling her that makes it worth it..:D.....she is my only real fight-buddy on campus...if we see eye-to-eye on a matter, something's def wrong...:P....there's no greater pleasure than annoying her with my jokes and getting that laugh in the end..!!!....she's bari's library kida-buddy...:D....works insanely hard...be it for acads or Nirmaan....very down to earth, very simple, very helpful, very honest, very good puncher (i still remember the shopco incident...P).....thanks for adding those awesome moments to my life in bits....all the very best...yo!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-repal">Neha Repal</a></p>
<p>One of my best friends, Shruti is amazingly dedicated and hardworking. It has been great knowing her, not just on campus but before that as well. She’s mostly cheerful and will go into peals of laughter at the smallest of jokes and looking at her laughing even you start to laugh. It’s been great fun watching movies and having “midnight chats” with her. She spends most of her time studying (or laughing :P) yet if you need a friend to talk to she will always be available. She is very caring and sometimes even takes on a mother like demeanour. She is also extremely dedicated to her work at Nirmaan and managed it so well. She has been to Zari so many times tht the ladies there look upon her as someone their own. They even celebrated her birthday in quite a grand way! A phodu in acads, she will never turn down the tons of people coming to her room for doubts before any exam. Even after doing so well in everything, she has always remained humble and down-to-earth, one of the qualities I really admire in her. I am sure she will do excellently in the future too. All the best my dear!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>

<p>Shruti .. The name itself reminds me of her cute little hands ..i love them so much :P . Shruti is such a sweet, simple ,conceptual, hardworking and extremely sincere fodu girl who keeps smiling at things. I m a fan of her innocence and her hard work.

<p>The girl with the smallest palm possible (but can slap people easily :P :P) … the one with the motherly vibes … the lover of “pink ”:P …the only person other than me who can laugh for silliest of the things ..  n just go on laughing without a reason ….  here is suttiiii … one of the people who I feel has the same taste as me .. be it in dressing … or movies … or songs … or be it something silly … ( like cute grandfathers :P) ( remember the debate we had wid ruju :P :D)
Do not remember when exactly we became friends … but always felt there was sumthing common between us ( some kind of a resonance  :P ) .. one of the toppers of chemical .. (who everytym feels unsatisfied bot her performance but turns out to top that course :P ). I think in 2nd year we had loads of fun in the library … laughing 99% of the time … for silly lame reasons … and eyes goin all watery due to too much laughing :P … I really enjoyed all the late night talking, watching movies, and oh yeah “friends” partners ( difficult 4 me 2 watch  friends alone :P) … I will never forget the stay at your place … during Diwali and in 2nd year too … bursting crackers … eating awsm food (esp the pani puri u made :P) … it felt very homely .. and it was difficult to go back to campus after that :P … 
Shruti is a very selfless .. warmhearted … caring … and a very helpful person (have bugged her many times with small problems :P) she can be as caring as a mother and make you feel better anytime … one of the most  HARDWORKING AND DEDICATED persons on campus .. be it nirmaan or acads she puts in her best … Spending these three years with you has been wonderful … Wishing you a bright future … do stay in touch … will miss you next sem ?

<p>Shruuuuuti! (i somehw just cnt say shruti :P )
One of the warmest and most caring people i know, not just in campus but anywhere. 
I think i first came to know her after i started going to library. (She is one of the regulars there and one of the reasons i feel like going there to study :P) I have become so used to her being around that it feels wierd and uncomfortable when she's not. Lunch has never been a solemn meal ever since i shifted to A mess and started having lunch with shruti and others. I remember when i once got C mess coz i forgot to lock my mess option and i went with some people from c mess i knew and when they saw me so miserable and askd, i started screaming i want shruti >.< i cant eat!! :D Don't know how i m going to manage an entire sem without her!!O.o She's always there to help no matter what time it is. Scolds me like an elder sister and always caring and giving off those motherly vibes that can make you feel so calm and secure. I am not particularly agreeable to hugs but I must admit(albeit reluctantly >.<) there have been times when i was feeling very down and i just wanted to go to her room and hug her. 
She is extremely hard working. Will give her all to whatever she does whether it is academics or Nirmaan. You just have to glimpse at the group once and you can tell how much the nirmaan juniors all love her. Someone i can really and completely count on and someone who can always cheer me up. She can be mature and sensible when she is needed to just as easily as she can be completely crazy and open to any kind of antics otherwise :P
Her smile and laughter are truly infectious and i can never ever forget them. I am sure our trip is going to be awesome!
There is this general sense of sadness among everyone that its ending and that goodbyes are inevitable and although i feel the same about many people, i just can't feel that way about shruti. It's like,somewhere in the back of my mind i know that i'll never have to miss her and nor will she.:)
I can completely picturise myself showing up wherever she is every now and then, in my open jeep and kidnapping her and the others to have some fun time, while she grins away in her typical adorable way :P
So here's to the great times we've had and even greater times to come! cheers! :)

<p>Suttiiii!!!!!ok.. That's what I call you know. Let me flashback! 9 years ago I was introduced to you by our mutual friend. Remember? ;) Little did i know that you would become one of my besties in the years to come. We were college-sorry-higher secondary school mates :D (thanx to lele sir ;-) ), tution mates, bench mates(with anu), bus-mates(while travelling to margaon alternate sundays),town(provorim) mates :P and now end up in opposite room which makes us corridor mates too :D. Its just more than a co-incidence! It has been wonderful to know her all these years. She is very mature, sincere, dedicated, hard-working, determined,fun-loving,dance-hating :P and the list is endless!She has a generous heart and forgive people very easily.. Remember my "apology" letter and the gift u gave me after that? ;). Such silly beings we were back then :D. After coming to bits you have changed a lot.. and changed for good :). Whatever we did , we had done it together(except for abhigyaan when i joined 1 sem early), went for Nirmaan inductions together in the 1st yr,rejected together and joined together again in the 2nd yr :P :D.Jokes apart, I had a superb time with you her these years. Especially the current sem. The large number of outings we had with our group of friends and fellow nirmaanites(especially the one to Japanese Gardens) are definitely worth remembering. She is very caring! I remember the number of times I fell sick and each time you made sure i was fine. I really do not know how to pay you back for that!!You have potential to achieve whatever you want because you have the right attitude! Keep laughing :D as always and continue to teach me Marathi in the coming years :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
<p>Vaze!!!!when i saw your face i thought you are a PYSHCHO!!!!..May be i saw you when there was no smile on your face...I do not even know that she was a part of nirmaan until 2-2..Vaze can you recapitulate the situation we met??.i can't!!!!!trying hard but could not...But i remember one situation...we both were in same SPM section and i was sleeping and you were laughing at me..It was an afternoon class...But this wonderful person became a good friend of mine in 3-1...She was one of the employment operations vertical head in nirmaan and an apt person to be so..Her unparalleled tactics in dealing with women of zari and resolving their conflicts are amazing...Starting from taking paper bag orders to distributing the money to the zari women(for all the 3 fests) vaze (and venu of course) your contribution is impeccable...All those late night discussions in C-wing balcony during Ex-comm meetings of nirmaan... and me disturbing you for no reason in midst of discussions...Calling vaze!!! loudly and asking you  "give me a five" again for no reason.. ridiculous but yaa memorable ones they are...the photo in which you are trying to hit me is the best memorable pic amongst my collection...U may think why i am i writing all these which are out of context...What to do!!!!Your friends have already revealed about you!!!! ! :P :P..What else can i say about a 9 pointer...?? But i can say definitely that you are not a nerd!!! :P im in your favour in this context( this is my opinion)... "Live life to the fullest" is what i guess you believe in and this is what i have learnt from you...Oh my god!!! i forgot to add...her hands!!!!!so small they are!!!!....Everyone used to compare their hands and this is where vaze used to say "STOP IT!!!!"that too again with small fingers....funny!!!!!!!!!is it not.?? Now that the time has come to depart..i would  like to give a tip... "Vaze..u have a great smile....never loose it,nevertheless the reason could be anything and maintain those high spirits which you have been maintaining"..All the very best for your future!!! and Good luck!!!!!  :)  :)...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>"Thank You", "Shut up", "I will kill you" - These are the 3 phrases in English that you use the most. :P Dedicated to her work, sincere and very tactful in dealing things! You have an everlasting smile on your face! The way you laugh for every petty thing characterizes you :D. It was an amazing time working with you and Venu for Nirmaan. Apart from Nirmaan, you've been a great friend to be around with. The first person I get into mind when I need some help on how to study :P. And, you surely know how to irritate people >.<.  The "Shu shu" incident in Birla can never be forgotten :P. The call you made on a day when I was going through sleepless nights made a lot of difference and pumped the confidence in me! :) Thanks for all those treats and the diary too! See, hyper-thanking-amea is contagious!  I will pray hard that you overcome this disease of yours :D. Good luck Shushi! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chandrahas-muvvala">Chandrahas Muvvala</a></p>
<p>Vaz Vaze :D :D, the cutie pie(yaya the alien creature in 10th class CBSE English tb  :P ;) ) of NIRMAAN :P….hahah jokes apart, vaze is the funniest, sweetest, shortest(:P) girl in the campus. She always has that everlasting smile on her face (must be some kinda madness :D). I like to make her laugh with my stupid expressions and by teasing her. She is always a good company when we all go out together.
Hey do u remember “vaze heights”…hahah can never forget tat building :D. ayyo and how can I forget her little palms…I still hav tat pic of ur palm and my palm comparison :D
Apart from sweet and cute, she’s THE NERD of NIRMAAN(av*4-3..vaze got the fun part??), hardworking and totally dedicated to her acads. Her love for SaJe is irreplaceable :P. Vaze is the woman behind success of zari SHG(Self Help Groups)..may it be settling conflicts, getting orders, talking to them for training..it was Vaze who was always in contact with the zari women and made communication easier for us all. Keep up with the good work.
All the best for the bright future ahead and do stay in touch…ur sriniVAZ :P :D

<p>Vaze!!! The sweetest girl in Nirmaan!!! Give her just 5mins and she'll capture your heart by then, with her innocent face and cutest smile. But when it comes to work, she is one among those who like to carry out the responsibility with utmost dedication, hard work and diligence.  She is very friendly and never hesitates to help others when they are in trouble. Always humble and puts across her point with a soft yet determined voice. Loves sending SMSs (:P), saying "Thank You " again and again, random chit chats and spending time in lib. Shruti, I'll never forget the time, we spent together decorating the bags during 2nd yr waves, roaming in Panjim trying to get orders for the bags, our routine discussions, trips, B'day celebrations.... and so on.. I admire the way how you handled all the conflicts in Zari, how you were so close to the women there and still maintained objectivity while taking decisions and the way how both Venu and you took our SHG's forward. :) I am sorry that this is our last sem together. You will be missed!! A lot!!!.... Wish you All the Best Shruti. :D Stay in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
<p>Vaze... as people call her.. which I don't like at all... extremely sweet, quiet n yet so talkative,... but ob..less than me... her sincerity, determination and hard-work stands out... total chemical material... pro in all subject and aces it all... the hard times, in which you were there, the funniest moments we could have, the departing sorrow, and the joy of meeting you... are moments anyone will want to live, and i am really happy that I have lived them all... Being with you in abhigyaan was fun, her work for Nirmaan, her dedication for SHG because of which it is succeeding leaps and bounds... hats off to her!!!... she is also the doubt-solver for our corridor, be it the subject of this sem, or the last sem... she is the best teacher at it... her love for all of us, can't be described... she keeps on helping people... and is exceptionally shruti...

<p>Shruti... One of my Sweet little sisters (SLS). She is one of the nicest person i know. The way she had worked for zari SHG is awesome. She is one of the person on whom u can depend and also very trustworthy. One thing you can clearly tell by seeing her that what ever she will do she will give her 100% to achieve whatever she wants. She's sincere, extremely hard working, dedicated, soft spoken and possesses an enthusiasm for all that she believes in, be it academics or work related to Nirmaan. She's always ready to help out anyone in need and without giving a second thought she will do what ever is required to help others. Topper of Chemical, most of the times you can see her studying in lib and still she will say that she was not studying. It's really great to have sister like her.
Hope you have a great future ahead....
