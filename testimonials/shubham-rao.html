<h1 class="page-title">Shubham Rao</h1><p>Shubham aka KID as we call him in lab. Apart from whining for lab reports, subba is a cool guy. Fun to hang out with and good at what he does best (you can guess that). Shubham has a great future ahead. All the best!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>"arree yaar main toh jaa raha thaa aur phir.................."
kid always is concerned about something but he is very diligent and completes every task. A very good friend of mine, "hum dono nee milke bahut logo ki - - ki hai". Music lover, downloads songs daily donno from where(only some of them are good rest are useless). Sitting with him in class is fun if nothing is going into our head coz then aur conversation starts about every thing in life[ girls, movies, faculty teaching,.....long list]. Had fun with him in all the BIO trips that we had and many more to come 8-D. 

P.S.: I am the one who named him "KID"   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>

<p>Shubham aka Subba aka shubham.rao …………… Kya bolu iske baarein mein …. He is really humble, jovial, dedicated, hard-working and known for his trademark phrase ‘Kathin Hai’ ..... Right <a href="http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/221"> Rastogi </a> ?…… He is a pro in his Bio CDCs and is probably the only one who studies them seriously (or do you ? :P) He is a pro in CS, FIFA too. Played a hell lot of matches with him in 2-1 and 2-2. He is a big fan of KFC and also Shahi ka Shorma :P Thanks for always calling me:) Will always remember that trip when you and I went to Panjim just to eat in KFC. And I will also remember that trip when you ditched me in Chicalim and took a lift :-/ ...... He gives me a tough competition in eating fast and gets seriously pissed off if you eat your food very slowly (especially during exams :P) Love teasing him about Jabalpur, Allahabad and many other things (Jabalpur mein mall hai kya ???? :P) <br> <br> Just be like the way you are Subba. Wish you all the best for your future and do keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>Subba, the proud Rajput (Why? Some incidents are better off not disclosed!) Nicknamed <strong> the tension boy </strong> in the early days of our college life, you were actually very tensed during test times! Earlier, you would go to C Mess alone (during tests and compre), have your meal and be back as fast as Flash! <br>
My first impression about you was totally opposite to what you are :D We had common extra classes (5th iteration admissions) and I thought you were some 'dood' with girlfriends and all :P OK, I wasn't totally wrong, isn't? <br>
Mr.Gold, pro CS, AoE, FIFA player, and yes, I will miss those DC emoticons as much as you would! Dood, share that free fund money sometime :D for which BITS Goa has been kind on you! <br>
You are very modest but hard-working. Abe lectures ke liye kaun padhta hai, and that too <strong> workshop </strong> Bio GOD, among the toppers always, apne EEE CDCs bhi aise hi phodna! <br> <br>
And don't over-think things, just do it ;) Wish you all the success in life, keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yachit-mahajan">Yachit Mahajan</a></p>
<p>"Aur launde!! kya likhu tere baare mein.. :P". Shubham aka kid is a very humble and down to earth person. He is intelligent, dedicated and hardworking. It was nice to have you in my lab group (you were working throughout the labs keeping me out of worries for the results). We share same taste when it comes to tv series and movies viz. dexter and game of thrones.He has a dedication to attend classes in spite of how horrible they can be. Aur next sem jog karne jaana hai launde woh bhi lake pe... :P. Able to manage his activities with elegance, success is soon to follow him. wish him all the best for the future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
<p><center> Bam Bam </center> <br>I welcome you all to an eye opener. I have been the sidey of Shubam Rao/Bam bam/Subba for the past three years. So long mate. He is like an onion. Now don't get me wrong. Wait for it ra, will tell you why i say so. First of all his taste for music. Has a really varying taste or music, likes the band-baaja-typical-hindi songs, the katy-perry-type-pop songs, the pitbull-party types  and on a lucky day, a few good rock songs (I have got to bear with his speakers you see) Thanks to the power fluctuations, his speakers finally gave way, so i no longer have to listen to fireworks or kiya kiya or ainvayi anivayi on an infinite loop spree. If i had to define a small unit of time to be used in daly life, then i would define 1 Subba=Amount of time he takes to finish his dinner in normal circumstances. (of course this time is very less when there is someone undesirable sitting next to him ;). You know whom does he love the most? Its him.. He really loves himself. Which i guess is not a bad thing at all. He loves himself for what he is. Goes berserk during exams, can hear frequent yells of  "Kya Chudaap hain be" or "Kathin hai be" during exams. But then there are some set of exams that he will rape anyways and there are some which he will flunk inevitably. There are people whom he really loves and respects but never mentions that(that is how it should it be). And there are people whom he doesn't love that much ;) but never forgets to mention that :p. Now to the onion thingy. It has several layers, right? Thats the same with you. There are so many layers to you. And its after all this time that i know that what you truly are. There is the first layer that makes you like him and then the next that makes you think that he is selfish, then the one that makes you think not so selfish and then you start liking him again and on and on.. But then when you reach at the center, the real spirit of you, I find that you are just an innocent kid. An innocent kid who love his friends more than he knows. (You should hear him go about "Kya chudaap duniya hain and all that shit" but as i said that is one of the layers and not him)He loves the world more than he knows. He loves life more than he knows. It was great to have you around. Ofcourse we will be wing mates in CH1 and ofcourse a longer route awaits. But nevertheless i cant find a better way to end this testimonial than, I love you subba and I will miss you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Shubham bhai..a person who is a great friend of mine. He has an immense ability to take bahut zyaada tension. But has the capability to work out his way out of that as well.He is always ready to help you...bahut lagayi hai iski doubts puch puch kar. He is good at academics.."only one" to answer in the class(when sir asks about the questions asked previous day). He reminds you for classes and reports. We have one more year to go my friend.  No need to mention hum ek dusre ke saath bina bole he touch mein rahenge. Wishing you great luck for your future life. :) Love you :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-dadu">Aditya Dadu</a></p>
