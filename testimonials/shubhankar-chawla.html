<h1 class="page-title">Shubhankar Chawla</h1><p>Chawla Saab !! Sat Sri Akal ... :) 
My fellow chemical'ian and punjabi veer , had my first conversation with him in 3-1 and I regret it for it would have been so much fun if I knew him before... Always jocular,sanguine, filled with aplomb and a genius loci. Had a great time with him for 2 Semesters and hope the fun element will continue !!! He is for sure a Polymath, a great friend and ladies' man :) .. 
May god bless him with best of his bounties and he realizes whatever he wishes for.. 
God Bless !!!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-trehan">Sahil Trehan</a></p>
<p>Savvy! The real "kamal ka banda" i know. Man with amazing enthusiasm and spirit, he is an excellent friend and really gr8 to hang out with. I really cherish the times in 2-1 we spent taking random trips to Panjim for no apparent reason. And wat else.... I really don get ur punjabi status msgs but i am sure they r good :P. Hope to keep in touch with you for long time and wish you good luck for all your endeavors. Keep rocking! Here is for the friend we all miss "Gal baat!" <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mitesh-tulsiyan">Mitesh Tulsiyan</a></p>
