<h1 class="page-title">Shubhankar</h1><p>Shubhankar aka Baba
I still remember how you got your nick Baba which I can’t share with everyone but m sure I might forget your name Shubhankar but not baba and now a new one Playbuuooyy.  
Baba I might have never told you but I have enormous respect for the passion you have for dance and not caring what people say when you walk with some dance moves in between. Baba you are a great dancer whatever we might say to make fun of you, please just keep dancing.
You have a real big heart because we would all the time laugh at your cost and you won’t hold any grudges against any of us and come back again the next day with the same enthusiasm to be the topic of discussion. I just wonder if you were not our friend what would have we done for 60% of our life in BITS.
Baba thank you for the wonderful  memories and I hope we keep creating new ones.

<p>Confident and a charming personality. I still remember the first day we met (in the mess) and the long walk around the campus along with tharki,rohit,abhijeet (well dnt remember othr ppl who were there) were ‘SHUBHANKAR’ earned his name ‘BABA’. Although the walk was cut short due to our fattu tomar, the trend of BABA didn’t stop. He is the BIHARI dude of our group and he surely lives life like a true BIHARI :D …. Despite of whatever I have said about you I feel you are a good guy, pure at heart and devoid of planning and plotting and chaal and fareb…….  Over the past 3 yrs, he and his tehelka activities have been the hot topic of our group and it seriously became a fav pass time for me at least :) ……… one more thing plz yaar ladki ka naam lete hue apne emotions control kiya kar warna sabko pitwayega ek din and also don’t stop being yourself for anyone. Thanks for the priceless moments I had with you and of course with HJ,Tharki, Tomar…  u hv been one of my best frnd in this campus and thnks for bringing me to this group at the start. I wish you u a very happy and successful life ahead…… always be in touch warna *** **** doonga…….. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>
<p>BABA first let me be clear .. all that chudaap .. leaving you behind in everything.. leaving you for dinner, never going to your  C mess nc.. all of that was purely co-incidental and not intentional...
okey some of that was intentional ... but it was never that i had any hard feelings .. it was just that i used to like the way you will come after me when i used to leave you and it would start a never ending streak of BARE LOGS and chote logs.. and aurat making a big nasty topic out of it... and for that i am guilty... but its the ways things are between us.. i dunno what it is.. maybe its a different level of chudaap we both share leaving aside rest of the chu club... btw you are the only true supporter of my awesome singing talent. and the thing which i never said after any of your dance nit.. you dance really well .. but stop dancing on roads at least leave b'rooms and hostel corridors... surely gonna miss you ... playbuoyyy oh bhul gaya  wishing you very best in your life ... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rohit-tomar">ROHIT TOMAR</a></p>
<p>one of the most irritating person :P..but THE sweetest, most friendly, patient, innocent person i know... :D ...this is SUBBU BHAIIII for me... he loves the thing he does..and he makes sure he completes it with full dedication..he loved hip-hop dance so he did it(your musafir was awesome)...of course our first waves performance, our 2nd waves salsa, our flashback and classics, our 3 winning competitions together, projector dance and finally the epic bhangra... all were memorable :D ...BABA our friendship was vry important and precious to me..a very enthusiastic, hard working and a fab dancer he is...may u achieve all ur goals in life...loved working wid u...ll miss u..all the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-bhalerao">AMIT BHALERAO</a></p>
<p>shubhankar srivastava aka BABA aka playybwuouy.. one of the most philosophical persons.. he has his own philosophy for everything (known as baba's version :D).. although that is not the reason his nick is baba (the reason is censored :P).. you are the greatest SRK 'guy fan' i have ever met (even girls are not such diehard fans :D).. there are so many incidents about u that i remember and i cant write all of them here but the funniest one that comes to mind is the 'gajar halwa' chudaap.. apart from that, we have done endless chudaap together and u have always been there for me (jyada udti thi to tu hi escape tha :P).. making fun of your dance will always be a fine memory but jokes aside, you are a great dancer and you have the desire to dance which is found in very less people, so keep dancing (but not on the roads :D)..   we have had our little arguments (and dont listen to the chus bcoz i have no grudge) and sometimes i have over-reacted, but u had the heart to forget that and 'take li8'.. i always jokingly say 'li8 le baba' but that quality of yours is one of the best in u.. just be that way and keep enjoying life..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jain-himanshu-hemant">JAIN HIMANSHU HEMANT</a></p>

<p>The first time I saw you dance I knew that you would do something big in life. Now seeing you dance in birthday parties and weddings I think I was  correct in my prediction. I sincerely think you are the most awesome guy in the Chu Club and you have a unique yet awesome way of doing everything- The way you dance, the way you talk, the way  you walk. Everything's godlike. You should aim much higher in life. BITS is ruining you. Sky is the limit for you talents. Its been an honour writing your testimonial. God bless you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>BABA, Only a club member would know how he got this nick, but believe me it was inevitable for it to be tied to him sooner or later :D. It is no secret that I don’t leave any opportunity  to poke and tease him, this only because I know he has a good heart and clear conscience and he won’t mind it even though he may complain for a little while (who listens anyway :D). He is a good dancer, no doubt, but you are bound to be shocked when you bump into people standing and shaking in weird poses half asleep early in the morning :P. Amongst the most passionate people I have known in my life, he also carries bravery (to face the constant bombardment by the club members). I have little to no doubt he would do good in his future and wish him luck for whenever or wherever he might need some… :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shakti-thakran">Shakti Thakran</a></p>

<p>I have known shubhankar since my first year and got to interact a lot with him in dance club.  A really nice and helpful guy, I will never forget how we rocked in our 2nd year zephyr - when our entire hostel was roaring with us. It was by far the best experience I have had dancing. The amount of satisfaction and happiness i derived from that performance was immeasurable. For that i thank you... Will also never forget the duos we did together which always turned out to be near debacles but were fun all the same. Thanks for being there whenever I needed help (especially in third year :P). I wish you all the very best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
