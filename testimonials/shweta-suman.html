<h1 class="page-title">Shweta Suman</h1><p>Shweta is one of the most motivated and enthusiastic persons I know. The way she has managed acads and co-curriculars has been amazing. Plus, she will never say no to a request for help. She has a “Never Say Die” attitude and will bounce back higher after every setback. I remember how we would code for the CP labs during the PAship in 2-2. And then after a break of a semester we got together again. An excellent coder, my “PLCC buddy” finds it really hard to stop talking. The times we spent coding (and recoding) every time the question changed really brought us very close and I kind of missed not having more assignments :P The mime artist of our (joint) corridor, she has entertained us several times with her excellent and memorable performances, leaving us gasping for breath. Always smiling with that cute and bubbly face, she has never failed to cheer me up. A true friend, she’s the reason I regret not going for 1st sem PS because I won’t be seeing her that frequently again :( All the best my dear! Hope you have a great future. You deserve it!  :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/apoorva-prabhu-verlekar">Apoorva Prabhu Verlekar</a></p>
<p>Shweta is one of the most genius person I have ever met, She has all the qualities anyone will want. She is enthusiastic, cute, hard-working, brainy and with good managerial skills. The way she managed, Director's tea-party single handedly, Hats-off to her... Being an extremely dedicated member of BITSAA and  DOPY , she managed her acads and project very well. I really feel proud that she is my best friend. I wish I could write all the moments we had, be it fun, sorrow, emotions, help, everything. One thing I really want to say that she is the epitome of her name.  A gtalk freak (:P), cutest kid, mama's girl, mature, lively, helping and a person who can die for her friends....  she  is one of the reasons that made me smile. Non-sense talks, sharing and caring have made our bonding special and stronger, I strongly believe she will reach the zenith of success, everything she wants, because even God knows you deserve it.... Love you yaar and will miss u a lot... tc... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>I met Shweta in my 2-1 and from then she became one of my gud friends in the campus. She is very talented, friendly, enthusiastic and fun loving person. She is very dedicated towards programming and stuff, I know how much she works hard for her projects and acads. She never used to go for sleep until she completes her project work for dat day.  The best thing about her which I noticed was, she helps others without expecting a thanks in return from them. She is very sweet hearted and she used to inspire and encourage me whenever I gave a bad exam and gets pissed off with acads. She was always there for her friends everytime when they need her support.  She has great future plans regarding both professional and personal life :P . Apart from studies, she is a very good music lover and she likes to watch movies with new ideas. I feel very happy to have a great friend like shweta in my Bits life and will miss her next sem in the campus. All the best for your future shweta and I hope u will reach great heights with ur dedication and passion towards your work :) keep smiling and may god bless u with happiness in ur entire life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raj-shekar">Raj shekar</a></p>
<p>Shweta, when i heard your name for the first time, I thot its just so apt for you, your face is so pure and serene, but when I got to know the real meaning, goddess Saraswati, I felt you are the epitome of your name.... You are genius, hard-working... Dedicated towards your family, studies and obviously your Project (:P)... Bubbly and cutie-pie, you are one of the reasons that make me smile, your drama, mimicry, acting... imitations, you are a complete package for an actor... wahan vi tu rocking hoti.... Your PS stories, gtalk sessions and teri lagaana... everything is going to be missed... You were always there for me, happiness, chides, sorrow, loneliness, shopping.... Meeting you in 1-1 was the best thing god could have done for me... Away from my family, You guys (You, Akansha and Preeti) were a new family for me... with all the love, affection and chiding that you have given me... You have changed so much... a grown up girl who takes care of her friends, wow... I can’t even think of shweta this way, when I met you for the first time..... 2-1 Diwali, it was just the two of us, and we still made it special... your cleaning campaign after exams, your inspirational updates, notes... you are one person that makes me proud.... An extremely work alcoholic, dedicated, conceptual girl... who is Physics pro... Your dedication reflects in your Co-curricular as well, BITSAA, DoPY, designing the BITSAAD site... _/\_ to your managerial-skills.... The only one untouched by Akansha’s effect (:P), motivational updates, notes, those comments, watching movies with you, everything is gonna be missed ... Your connectivity with your mom and the way you could connect to her.... has somehow made the relation between me and my mom better...thanks to you... Non-sense talks, sharing and caring have made our bonding special and stronger; I strongly believe she will reach the zenith of success, everything she wants, because even God knows you deserve it.... I feel my part will be missing when I won’t see you... Love you yaar and will miss u a lot... tc... :)

<p>One of the most unique people I have met in my life and closest to my heart. Sincere, hardworking , dedicated, ambitious, passionate and  SOOO PHOTOGENIC ( my photos folders are loaded with her pics!!).  Formatting her laptop and uninstalling gtalk ( so that she stops chatting :P)  and re-installing it are her favourite hobbies. The harder she tries keeping her room clean, the messier it gets. Coding, Biju Sir, OS, lab, library , onlines are the words at the tip of her tongue …but deep down..a very sentimental, affectionate  and warm person. Somebody who was always there for me no matter what happened and someone whom I really trusted. Inspite of her busy schedule (the heavy and the high level projects under Biju Sir) she always had time for me, understood my problems without me having to tell her and  gave me just the right advice,space and time I needed.  The hours we have spent together in my room( coz yours had no space :P ) talking the most random things on Earth and the  walks around the campus are just priceless. Tea or coffee  at monginis will never be the same without you. I will miss the knock on my door you used to give everytime you went for filling water. May you achieve whatever you wish for!..Will miss you loadsssssssss….Love you ?..take care..nd don't you dare forget me!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/preeti-kumari">PREETI KUMARI</a></p>
<p>I haven't known you much, but earlier I got the impression that you were a big nerd.. but on interacting with you, I realized what a wonderful person you are...+ Acads fodu!! Won't write much, just wanna say Achieve great heights & keep rocking! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yash-sinha">Yash Sinha</a></p>
<p>From what I know of her, she is someone who has figured out her field of interest and works with a lot of dedication towards it. She won a KVPY scholarship back in time before joining college and had other achievements. It is incredible that she didn't put a stop there and still continues to be motivated to achieve in life. She doesn't belong to this group of people who work madly to get only grades, rather she takes real interest in things and does well. Apart from academics, she is this chirpy person with a very cute smile and a dimple. Talking to her is fun and takes tension away. She can be funny and make you laugh, especially with the mimicry she does. Your presence around will be missed when you go off for PS. I wish you all the good luck in life so that you can achieve you goals<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/neha-yegnamurthy">Neha Yegnamurthy</a></p>

<p>Shweta is one of my PS1 colleagues who worked with me on the same project. That is when I realized how intelligent she is and how good she is at coding & other CS stuff. Her problem solving skills and the passion for computer science are amazing. She is very good at striking a balance between work and relaxation. (So, on the whole, she is a geek but not a nerd.) Infact, she was a strong reason for the 'relaxation' attitude getting added to my workoholic life. She loves to roam, visit places and thanks to her, even I started liking roaming and sightseeing. She is very innocent and EXTREMELY sensitive. Loves her mom a lot. In the 
deepest of her hearts, Shweta strongly desires to fulfil her mom's dreams about her career and life. She is an extremely grateful person, fun-loving, modest, trustworthy, mature and well-composed in character, always ready to help whatever the situation may be. Her philosophies and advices about life helped me recover from the stalls in my life and move on. Thanks a ton for being my friend Shweta and I thank my PS1 for that too. Wish you all success!!! Hope you achieve your targets and fulfil your dreams. All the best :) :) :)

<p> Shweta ….the girl with a spark who is cute,sweet and bubbly....always smiling and always ready for a photograph (:P)..a girl with her own principles, she is epitome of goodness and sincerity…very very very responsible. Her dedication and perseverance towards her goals and aspirations is amazing. Stalwart member of bitsaa, she manages time very well. Watching horror movies with her always turns out to be a funny experience?, her comments and expressions are just too good. Her excited expression (hand gesture) is \m/. A fairy of her own wonderland….i never saw her studying for grades…she will always say…. “Try to get the concept and grades will come on its own”. Fan of Ayn Rand, she symbolizes idealness. Her coffee drinking speed is so fast…by the time I start she is almost done….btw she is the reason I eat so fast in mess (:P) .We had loads of fun together being neighbours. I will never forget our long talk sessions about random things and the laughs we shared. You have made my bits life special and memorable. Hope we have a gr8 time together in the coming years. Wishing u loads of luck and happiness<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akansha-suneria">Akansha Suneria</a></p>
<p>Whenever I see Shweta around, she is just running, she 
probably has forgotten that there is a concept called walking and 
also that there exists a state called relaxation. Here is a person
who wants to do everything that can be done, and I must say she is doing it and doing it with perfection.
I will not comment on her academic abilities because I believe I simply
possess no credentials to do so. All I know is that she is extremely good at everything she does. Her love for her work and her abilities are awe-inspiring.
This young woman has a great love for talking, which is I believe one of the characteristics I share with her. She can simply talk about anything and everything, her knowledge continues to astound me every time. She can switch over from talking about AI in complete technical jargon and then switch over immediately to talking about the cool evening weather before I can even catch up. She has put herself into a wonderful cycle of learning and growing, which inspires me everyday.
Her heart is so pure and clean. I believe she has never held any bad thoughts about anyone, all she talks about is goodness in everyone.
This comes from within oneself. When one is so good on the inside, it is impossible to hold anything against anyone.
All her qualities, her principles and her strong values have set her on a path towards great achievements in life. A combination of these along with a kind and loving heart is what makes her a complete person.
I will always cherish the memory of this wonderful human being. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritesh-gudge">Pritesh Gudge</a></p>
<p>You are one of those rare people with whom one can just hit it off the first time itself.Being your friend was the easiest thing that I've done in my life.In these 3 years of college life you are as much a part of daily schedule as the classes...no actually more than them.My classes are never satisfactory and complete until you are sitting next to me(and sleeping :P). Until you come,my head automatically turns towards the door whenever someone enters.
Right from our first sem we've done everything together (almost)-whether it was crying over the workshop disasters,taking a project(and then crying over its workload),and now ps.In between the sad and happy times we've shared I didn't realize how much attached  I became with you. 
Although you are the messiest person I've seen,your heart is just the opposite - absolutely clean and pure.
You've always been there for me,whenever I needed you.  I can never thank you enough for what you did for me in our first year....I needed a friend....you gave me more than I could ask for.
To tell you the truth you've inspired me a lot to work..and enjoy my life.Bas tension thoda zyaada leti hai :P. I just want to say that I cherish our friendship a lot and will always be there for you whenever you need me.
You made this journey worth living.
P.S - Teri deadline se pehle likh liya :P :P...and yes... I completely forgot...you are the one source which connects me to the world(you have info about every gossip and every important thing) ,and you are the person who taught me the word 'LITE'(how can I be a true bitsian without it).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/meghna-mehta">Meghna Mehta</a></p>
<p>Hmm….wondering how do I start the description of my experiences with her….should I start with the mad times together…the insane talks…the incessant laughs we have shared…the ‘calories’ talks…or the heart rendering talks…the emotional talks…the times when we have hardly had to talk to express what we feel…and yet all was understood…..well….she's with me through all of that!... never hesitates to call a spade a spade .. …will laugh heartily over silly jokes!...
lets start with her charming looks..a really very very cute girl...with a smile glued to her face permanently... Her personality is just a reflection of her looks... a total charmer, the sweetest girl I have ever met and a very cheerful person.... an all rounder .. she loves to dance and is absolutely brilliant when it comes to academics. Deep rooted Indian, loves her family above anything else.
I am sure you will have an amazing future :) . I will always cherish all the moments we spent together. Our friendship is not one of those which ends here.... we will always be in touch no matter where life leads us :)

<p>Said a lill hi while she was with a friend of ours. Our introduction. From then, topics of discussion between us knew no range. Hours on gtalk, and years passed without realization. Now when i look at the image of her in my mind, I see a pretty successfull person in life. She is one of the most hardworking fellas on campus i have met, and she doesnt regret it(the best part). She enjoys it. Pretty hard to deter such a person from the path of success and satisfacion in life. Her personality is one of the most intriguing and interesting. One of the most coveted positions on campus for CS people is a project under Biju and obviously she got it. Being a good friend of her i came to know her real interests and was astounded to find that it is not CS !!!! . I just wonder what she can do in there. Lots of stories I know of her(I am honoured). I like "Street Demons". Shweta is also a person who feels responsible for others a lot. I would like to tell u "ur life ur way, u responsible for u :)". Lots of smiles we have shared lots of memories we have etched, lots of time we have frozen, and frozen they will be forever. Always stay in touch and success cant run away from u!! Cheers !!    <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/souvik-dutta">Souvik Dutta</a></p>
<p>Shweta Sweet, humble, intelligent I think these 3 words explains you enough. As no interest in CS I took you as my deco lab partner so that you will do all the work but you proved me wrong and opposite happened :P Although all that would not be possible without your help and motivation and IC testing done by you. :P I have a lot of respect for your ideology and courage to take step forward in the direction where you want to go whether it’s difficult or easy. _/\_ 
My good wishes are always with you. May god gives you all the strength to realize your dreams. Always keeps a smile on your face because that suits you a lot. All the best. :)

<p>\m/.. Shweta!!! The bubbly girl with a cute smile..The one with beautiful eyes..The girl with a strong will power and determination!. A busy one 

indeed, with her library schedule and BITSAA work.. The 9p of our corriodor.. The girl who can never walk :P.. always has the habit of running 

:D and the one who uninstalls gtalk during/just before exams :P :P.. "Ab bas karo :P" would be her reaction.. Jokes apart, she is very intelligent 

and hard-working... Once she sets her target on something she strives to achieve it under whatever circumstances she may be in! When it comes to 

thinking, she is very mature( this might be one of the potential reasons why finds everyone like a "bachcha(i)" :D).. very good at taking decisions.. 

You can count upon her if you are in a dilemma.. She analyzes the situation very well and very quickly and gives sensible and practical 

decisions/advices..Coming to the fun part of her, she loves posing for pictures :D and is very diet conscious :P.. Our occasional dances in the 

corridor when she unintentionally tickles me wil be missed :P.. The best part about her is that she loves or rather appreciates my jokes :D.. In 

total, shweta , you are a wonderful person to be with.. Do stay in touch :).. All the very best for your future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranita-morisetty">Pranita Morisetty</a></p>
