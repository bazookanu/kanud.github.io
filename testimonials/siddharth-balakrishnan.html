<h1 class="page-title">Siddharth Balakrishnan</h1><p>I used to hate mech labs, but the good thing happened there is Siddharth became my friend. He is a quiet, calm and a friendly guy with a amazing sense of humor. He is the only guy I met who actually sleeps at 11 and get up at 6 _/\_. Although I dont know him personally much, but I wish all success for him in life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Sincere, awesome, humble , nerdy and the list of adjectives just doesn't seem to end when I start thinking about this guy. I got to know him better after Maths-3 because at that time unlike now I attended classes regularly. He is so damn meticulous, I kind of wonder how he does it all. Going to classes, having an awesome CG, meddling with his S2!  :P A great guy overall and a good friend who I can count on for notes any day if Krati falls sick :P He is destined for a bright future and I sincerely wish him all the best. Keep smiling and chill out :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>The first thing you would notice 

about SBK is his height. At 6 feet 

above ground level, he towers over 

the rest of us in the group (and most 

certainly over me :D). The second 

thing you would notice is his 

exclusive membership of the early-

to-bed-early-to-rise club on campus. 

If a machine were to be programmed to 

walk around like a human, it would 

probably look like Siddharth. Even 

Mumbai local trains don't stick to 

their timetables like he does; at 

6AM, he will be up, at 7.30AM, he 

will be in C mess. And certainly 

don't expect a response from a knock 

on his door after 11PM :D One of the 

most sincere guys I have ever met, 

SBK is a brilliant, diligent and 

industrious person who  puts in an 

amazing amount of dedication to 

whatever he's doing; acads, TV series 

or his S2. Immense knowledge about 

abything with wheels. Still remember 

him as a shy guy whom I befriended in 

the first few days after joining 

BITS. Probably the only guy in our 

group (or I think in the entire 

world) who laughs even at Uppal's 

jokes. Another integral part of our 

mess time conversations, his complete 

disdain for being discreet and his 

loud, booming laughter have sort of 

defined our group. Him being in mech, 

I honestly miss all those times that 

we spent in 1st year classes 

together, poking fun at all the 

proffs.  He has been an absolutely 

\m/ friend throughout these 3 years, 

more a brother than just a mere 

friend.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>Siddharth BalaKrishnan or SBK is one of those remarkable persons who simply refuses to change his sleep timings despite 3 years into Engineering (He still sleeps at 11 and wakes up at 6:00 am). Ever smiling, he has a carefree attitude which is just infectious. You can always expect him to laugh at a joke, however silly it may be. You can always expect him to give a review on the latest movie or strike up a conversation about literally any TV series. He is diligent, hardworking and very knowledgeable about anything on wheels. As a fellow gaming enthusiast, I have always loved discussing about games with him. And despite his carefree nature and a certain reluctance to mix with people, you can always count on him to give you mature advices. Be it his extraordinary height or his peculiar gait, Siddharth is definitely a person you can never miss out on, a truly loyal and steadfast friend. My best wishes to you Siddharth :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>I first met his father in the train while coming to BITS. We were MSc Physics that time. 
He attends all lectures (which is a great achievement according to me). He also plays a lot of PC games.( at least that's what he says.. :P). His sincerity was at its peak during first 2 years. I think I influenced him in 3-1 :P. Always happy. I have never seen him angry. I always enjoy sitting next to him in the class ( very few incidents though ). He keeps cracking jokes about the prof during the lecture. I enjoy that. An open minded fellow. A good friend indeed.
Wish you All the Best ( I m sure that you don't need these wishes. you are a PRO already)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
