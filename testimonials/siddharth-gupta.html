<h1 class="page-title">Siddharth Gupta</h1><p>Siddhart aka bhaiji, too much to write and too little space.. a phodu mathematician , with exceptional leadership skills. He certainly knows what it means to be a real friend, can do almost anything when his fiends need them. An ambitious person, to whom one can always look up to in hour of need, coz "are tumhe nahi aata,ruko... bhaiji to kar hi denge.. " ..a jack of all trades, and a buddy who made my experiences of college life intersting by being a part of it..... Il truly miss you chotu.. hope you do well in all your endeavours... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-agarwal">Nishant Agarwal</a></p>
<p>My chotu, a very sweet, kind hearted person...Very fast learner and remembers everything. If you want to know anything about placements, faculty, CSA, alumni,...........Politics, Mars or anything else, he is the right person to talk to. No kidding, he is a wonderful friend,a GEM everyone would like to retain. 
 Be it booking a bus for a trip or teaching others 2 hours before the Compre bhaiji you have always been 1 step ahead from all of us and have always been ready to help friends. In the truest sense your name 'BHAIJI' suits you. You will make a very good leader. Just remember that you have many more good qualities and much more potential than what u estimate of urself. My college life would have have been a little empty without u.... I will miss u....Hope u achieve what u desire and fate and success always be on your side. ..All the best..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>
<p>Siddharth, better known as bhaijee, is one of my very good friend in campus. It doesn't matters how much time you spend together, rather quality time spent together becomes memorable.Same is our case.
Very trustworthy person.Whenever I felt low, I would go and share my feelings with him.

He is one of the few whose interest is in accordance with their branch, which is quite evident from his Maths grades  :)
As a friend he is always there to help. I would turn to him in the last moment with my books saying "bhaijee bacha lo", and he never refused.

those long nite chats....few special nite canteen trips....last moment crash course....well these give me all the more reason to miss you...
and I surely will.....
I know u'l excel in your life, still  ALL THE BEST  :)  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nawaz-nasar">Nawaz Nasar</a></p>
<p>Hey Bhaijij ,
hum ab bhi nhi bhule jab tum ES1 exam ke 1 din pahle apna preparation chorr kar hum sabko  pspice sikhaye the. ya fir mos ke exam ki subah 1 poora chapter padhaye the,ya fir maths3 exam dene jaate waqt raastey me hi 1 proof (jo us exam me mujhe 10 marks dilwaya tha) batlaaye the. ohhh agar yuhi likhta rha toh shayad ye testimonial ka page hi khatam ho jaaye, par i just wanna tell you bhaiji that u r the biggest asset that we guys have as a friend.U r a true friend who i know will alwayz be there with us in all type of situations.
Apart from ur generous nature u r also famous for  ur "bhayankar gussa" which we all know is very short lived as u have a very kind heart inside and thats why i give u this punchline of 
"Bahar se Garam aur Andar se Naram." hamara apna bhai ji.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nilabh-sinha">NILABH SINHA</a></p>

The cutie pie of our group , he is one of my very close frnds in campus.I am glad to have such a friend .He is always ready to have fun ,help me out during exam time. The best quality i like about him is that he does nt give a damn to what others think abt him and do what he likes to do.He also posses good leadership quality and in many of our  trips  he is the one who looks after the cash flow.A gr8 fan of sachin tendulkar and Amitabh Bachan.He has a deep love for very thng he posses and always cherishes it.Siddharth thnx for all the awesome moments you have shared with me ,be it be the long bike trip,cricket matches(playing or watching),playing poker and all those halke fulke moments that we spend in our very own ground floor corridor. Bhaijee u will always have  special place in my heart and life...and will be missing you.best of luck for ur future endevours.And now stop being sad becoz we have one more sem together and we are going to make it more memorable and fucking awesome.

<p>Well ....it's hell difficult to decide where to start from when it comes to talk about Siddharth... Whether it's his helping nature or an always smiling face or a heart with honest feelings for everyone..or just that he is an awsome friend...who knows a lot of nakhra tooo....but ya exactly knows how to handle me and my anger when it goes beyond control.....only thing i felt bad about is that why did'nt i meet him before my PS...it would have been much more fun....he helped me alot at PS1 and since then we are good friends.....actually amazing friends...can trust him with anything.....I know you are going to be successful and will definitely get what you want or dream of... just keep smiling...and always be in touch...:):):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/divya-gupta">divya gupta</a></p>
