<p>Siddharth Sahu aka S!d aka "something written on his door". :) Well what can I say ? Lines are not at all enough to describe him. To start with, he is a typical mumbaikar with his typical mumbaiyya accent. He is my the best friend in the campus, always ready for fun and adventures. I am very lucky to have him as a batch mate, project mate. He is the coolest dude, very supportive, charming, and "always smiling" ;) .  He is a hard working guy, loves music, and die hard F1 fan. I will never forget our campus walks, late night teas, all fests and all the amazing trips we had. Wish you very happy and successful life ahead. :) 

P.s. bas cheque bhijwa dena....upar jo  achha achha likha hai uske liye. ;)

<p>SID - the dude of ME, having happy go lucky nature. (for some people he is very similar to Chandlar's character from FRIENDS.........:) ) A genuine person and someone on which you can depend. He is the first person whom I used to ask for anchoring in events n he had always managed it very nicely. We have lots of fun during organizing events. I will always remember the scene during the blood donation camp organized by Nirmaan and will always keep in mind the value of your donated blood. During our last sem on campus I will try to help you to achieve your goal provided it is feasible.... :) (n i hope this time u will take feasible word seriously...) Thanks for being such a nice friend. 
I wish him ALL THE VERY BEST for future.......<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-peshwe">Paritosh Peshwe</a></p>
<p>When I first met Sid, I thought he's all that studious kinda guy..and guess wht, I was right! :P
Oh who am I kidding sahu...u are the coolest Mumbaikar ever! \m/
Also called '$tifler' (although i have no idea wht the hell that means!), sid is that person who u dont wanna miss out on fun! At first i thought he's reticent..later i came to know it was the silence b4 storm! He's a wild customer :D Love the way he cracks those witty jokes every now n then, loves F1 more than anyone. This guy's life is an open book..although ironically he  behaves extremely mysterious sometimes. All in all...sid.. ur one of the most hard working, funny, charming, catchy and as i said..coooolest guys i have ever been with! Lucky to have a buddy like u..have a gr8 future ahead! Some advice.. that guitar u bought is crying inside it's bag, take her out; don't let the wild yet cool persn inside u die ever and yes..learn to play CS better! :P

<p>One of the people who ll end up giving this country its new National Language.. 'The Bombayya (Read Tapori :P) Hindi'.. "Matlab waat lag gayi naa apun ki.." :P 

Always cheerful.. V good at heart.. Tough decisions come when it he has to choose between posing for a photograph and having an extra piece of the Birthday cake.. 

N when he chooses the later one, that's when ur jaws drop.. All the gals who have fallen 4 his smile.. Wait till u know him.. you ll fall down n roll over kicking your feet 

up in the air.. 'Matlab waise karegi naa tu' followed by a nod of deep understanding and his patent smile.. When u hav a completely bad day if u meet dis guy.. b sure 

that u r totally going 2 forget all ur worries n start believing Megan fox can becum d US president one day!.. U need him.. He ll b thr 4 u one night b4 compre.. V 

creative.. esp when he has some  mishief on his mind.. and after dat 'Achhe se lagaa di naa' feeling he ll seal it with a smile dat says 'Mischief Managed'! D second he 

catches ur attention.. B sure.. He ll sweep u off your feet (preety sure by pulling the carpet beneath them!! :P :P) U rock dude! :)
