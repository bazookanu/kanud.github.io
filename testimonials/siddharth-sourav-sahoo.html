<h1 class="page-title">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</h1><p>As the nick name suggests, "Rhyno", minus the horn :P
An alrounder in life; an awesome student and a good friend. Thats all abt the good stuff, now lets look at the dirt. 
Never try to think what he is planning going by his mischievous and devious smile, coz u can never imagine. Making full use of his athletic abilities in his pranks, he can drive anybody nuts. To a third person its really funny but Lord have mercy on whom its being played on. :) :D 
Now seriously, an awesome friend, amazing footballer and owner of a witty sense of humor. I will miss the long hours spent in Zari and Vasco for no real reason.
Truly man, may you achieve all the success you dream of. :-)

<p>RHYNO- He’s probably the most energetic guy I’ve ever met. An all-rounder in every sense, /\ coder, /\ footballer, /\ artist, /\ math-solver,/\ gamer, the list goes on…Its been 3 years and I must say there have been a lot of memorable moments with this guy. He somehow has time for everything, never once did he say no to any fun thing I might have proposed. Also he’s a true Professional(:P).!The times we spent in Shabbar’s room troubling him will never be forgotten. And yeah, to whomsoever this might concern, be careful whenever you’re doing something stupid when he’s around coz this guy has a habit of recording funny videos all the time(and deleting them perhaps.. :P). He’s sure to succeed in anything  he wishes to do. And please always be the rhino that you are. I know we’ll always stay in touch. Best of luck..!

<p>Sir _/\_  Siddharth Sourav Sahoo(famously known as Rhyno) is a football player, an acads pro, a pro coder, an artist, a pro gamer, an assignment doer(unlike others who borrow assignments, he does it on his own....he might be the source of one of your assignments) and a great friend. He is an enthusiastic and confident guy. You will always see him full of energy and life. He is usually involved in pranks played on entra and shabbar but he always has their best interests at heart. He is a dedicated guy and will succeed in whatever he wishes to do. All the best for your life ahead and have a great one.

<p>Rhyno!! its sad that i only got to know him as a friend in the 3rd year... A phodu banda, to the true sense of the word... Excels at everything- acads, sports, art, LAN gaming, doing random tp, trips to velino, u just name it, and he has mastered it. I dont know wat i would have done without him in those dull analog labs and power electronics.One of the most energetic i've met here, ready to do anything, and a great person to hang out with. As u said, its sad this is our last sem together buddy. All the best for ur future. i know u'll do good :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ahut-gupta">Ahut Gupta</a></p>
<p>However many people may start calling him “Daya”, he’ll always be the same “Rhynooo!!!” to me,  who still charges like a bullet at you, stops at the very last second and freaks the hell out of you. He is one chilled out guy and an awesome neighbor and friend, more than what I could have hoped for. You just can’t stop laughing when he’s around. He always cracks the funniest one, however humiliating, controversial or true it might be. Getting to understand and COPY every EnI assignment or otherwise was just one of the few perks of staying close to him. He’s a genius, yes, and has a commendable sense of routine which I wish I could ever imbibe. We have had awesome three years now and you will be missed dearly man! I can only imagine how lucky those people will be who have a chance of knowing you as well as I did  :-)
All the best for everything you decide to do =)

<p>Siddharth ( a name which hardly ANYONE uses ), known popularly as Rhyno and Daya( darwaza todo!! ) because of his ever energetic antics like charging people like a bull and racing towards mess at lightening speed, has been my neighbour for the past three years. He is one person who is confident about anything and everthing in life and has complete faith in his capabilities. He has rock solid determination which is quite evident fom the fact that he makes his name in anything he tries be it studies, sports, computer games, sketching. Has a very good sense of  humour and you won't find anyone who believes more than him in calling a spade a spade at your face. Hope to stay in touch always. And all the best for  future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunwar-kanishk-singh">Kunwar Kanishk Singh</a></p>
