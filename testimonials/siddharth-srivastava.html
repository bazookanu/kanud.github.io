<h1 class="page-title">Siddharth Srivastava</h1><p>I got to know him in late 2-2 through Saksham. He is calm, composed, caring and humble. Soft spoke, polite and extremely helpful.  His unique personality and height immediately capture everyone's attention. He is cool headed and a very good listener. I am glad to have known you. I wish him all the best for his future.. Be in touch... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>I met you in my E-Mech lab and ever since you've been a good friend of mine. You're fun to hang-out with. I still remember your insane comments about KVRB Prasad and Murti. Thanks for making those long lab hours bearable.. I had a great time with you. Have a great life ahead... Best of Luck for future...!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>I met this gentle giant for the first time at the cricket nets and his unusual wrong footed action stood out. We started speaking more towards the end of 1-1 when he feared dearly for our C.G.P.A. He is very very soft spoken and has brilliant presentation skills. I vividly remember his TRW presentation. It has been great knowing you and hanging out once  in a long while. All the best for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Siddy!! What comes to your mind when you see a 6 feet 4 inches (right?) tall guy with such a build. Sheer intimidation right?? Yup.. But that was only till we had not meet, Only till we did not talk for hours with topics ranging from Arundhati Roy and Jhumpa Lahiri to the "cheese" we used to eye at Monji ;-). Only till we had not gone to countless bogmallo trips. Only till I did not take "shots" with you (that was losing virginity wasn't it?)  and spent those several hours at Monji with you. Can never forget the way you speak, that calm and soothing voice. We all know how well natured, matured and soft spoken a guy you are. And saying anything more on those lines would be just redundant. I just want to say, a friend is one with whom you can be "your self". By that logic Siddy is the best friend one can have. And dont get me "Gay", but you have one of the most radiant smiles that i have seen anyone with. I have never seen him envy anyone. There are just a handful of guys who rejoice at others' achievements  as their own. You are one of them. I remember the first time when we had a really long discussion, we were coming for the lib at night, and we were telling :ek dusre ki zindagi ki kahaaniya: and man.. I say.. Here is one matured intelligent person. And I dont know how to make this sound real, since every testimonial has this, but with the close range(thanks for giving me that privilege) that i have known you, you are an immensely talented person and I know that you will hold true to whatever do. And will stand up to what you think you should. And all that about wishing you a very successful life and all.. Total bull shit.. We are friends for life aren't we? Salo baat to log aise karte hain ki jaise life mein kabhi milne nahi wale... PS: DP change kar saale..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>CD...... The Mount Everest of our group......intuitive, artistic, creative, smart.......I can just go on and on but I don’t think countless words together can describe this wonderful friend of mine.......a guy with amazing vision, full of dreams and will to go on. I have been friends with Sid since my first sem here......since then we have shared amazing moments….from silly Basketball bets to huge economic and political discussions….from senti  trips to Bogmalo(high on life :D) to Birdwatching sessions at Mongi. Our discussions at Dinner table, your undying love for Jhumpa Lehri, your half a km wide wide Ball, Doodh Sagar trip, beautiful videos (:P) of you and Tomar, godlike DJ nights, your every night performance on Bedardi Raja :P and many more memories that made my college life the best one. With his calm and composed voice and soothing words he can make anyone his fan….I know I am one of them. You were there to advise me when I needed a brother and slap me when I was stupid. Well I promise you I will always be there troubling you….a toast to our Friendship. ”MAY” nope….I know you will be successful in all your future endeavors. With this wonderful past……I know Future is gonna be legendary.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-mathur">Rahul Mathur</a></p>
<p>Though his imposing looks say otherwise, Sid is surprisingly soft-spoken and polite. I've known him since the past two years, and I've enjoyed every bit of the time we've spent together. This guy is an intellectual. You'd find him in the library during exams, reading some thick non-fiction work with an unpronouncible (or hilarious) author's name, instead of his CDC's. Each time, there's something new in your conversation, something to learn about. You're always ready to try something different. (like a certain substance we'd planned to try in 4-2). You question society. You think independently. And you do what you like, not what we're all supposed to do out here. It always amazes me to see how much you know on absolutely everything, from greek mythology, to China's tibetan policy. I admire your straightforwardness and openness, how you'll always mean what you say. I admire how much you respect other people. You're one of the most mature people I've met. Most of all, you're a real friend (and I totally mean it). You've always had my back. You listen, and respect my opinions, even some of the stupider ones, like the grow beards in office thing. Wait, that's not stupid. Anyway, it's hard to find friends who put other people over themselves, but you're one of them. You're selfless. Others matter to as much as yourself. You have the potential to do really big things. Just as soon as you find your own "I can fuck people" tee. I really hope we keep in touch, wherever we go, cuz it's hard to friends as awesome as you. And yeah, let's make that to-do list sometime soon. (And as Milind said, change ur DP. You look like you were just slapped.)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Siddharth, Sidi, Bheem... no matter what u call him, the odds are - u'll always look up to him :P
You have always made me feel a lil bit awkward wen we guys walk together (kitta bada hai yaar). I remember the journey began in the first week in campus wid our chit chat sessions on the hostel stairs and u were gonna perform as Bheem in a play (man that role seemed very apt for u dat time :P). To be very frank, initially i was intimidated by you and i guesss that's the case with most of the ppl but once they get to know a lil better, things change drastically.I have always admired you for the qualities that you have and trust me buddy, the looking up to u isnt because of ur height.Exceptional debating skills, that rafi like voice of urs( i srsly feel u shud try singing properly). I'm sure even aftr the high frequency of wide balls, cricket team ppl who have faced u will never forget to come on pitch without that guard :P ;). You are one of the best mimicry guy dat i hv come across in my life and the fun we hv had wen u hv made other ppl's life hell by that :D. Then even ur mime performances have been brilliant esp the undershaker one which got trickled down to the cricket team as well :P. U are perhaps the only prsn i'm scared on the dinner table coz u are a bastard and never miss a chance to take my case :x. That also reminds me of the very refined sense of humor that u have. I'll need a whole book to mention the number of times we hv had special fun together, be it the majorda trip in 1st yr, or the verna go karting where u almost finished the job :P, those numerous bogmalo trips and the new yr's bash we had this sem, i cant forget all these even if i want to. Above all these things, the most important thing is perhaps the kind and pure heart that you have which will always make you a very special person in the lives of the people around you.There have been thousands of times when i ws down and out due to some stupid reason and you hav always been there to push me up and say some amazingly positive thing which re ignites the spark and makes the phoenix rise again from the ashes. Such things make us remember the good times of our college life 10 years in the job and everyone associated with you will have happy tears in their eyes for sure.One more thing, the fun that we hv had on the dj nites will always be a part of my memories.One request though, try to cut down the agression a lil bit while playing :P darr lagta hai bhai tere se ;). The fact that u along with others wont be there next sem makes me feel ultra sad and even though i dont wanna think about it but it is inevitable, but it is gonna create a huge void and life wont be same.Trust me even my campus life gets over this sem itself. U'll do sumthing great in your life, something unconventional i believe , best wishes for that .Keep ROCKING :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhiraj-tomar">Abhiraj Tomar</a></p>
<p>This person is always smiling except in photos :P He has unique sense of the world, he understands the subtleties of human emotions and actions. A voracious reader, full of knowledge on all topics. 
He is deeply philosophical. I enjoy all the conversations I have with him. He understands what you want to say before you even say it.
He is a very good listener, and always has genuine interest in what you talk to him about. His huge stature is at first overwhelming, but when you begin to know him it all clears away. It is not long before one realizes what a wonderful person he is. He is the one person whose advice I always take when I am choosing an approach to make my decisions. He has a deep understanding of how things work in this work in this world. It is always a pleasure to listen to explain various topics, concepts . The way he describes events, like a thriller story, always includes gradual build up to an awesome climax. He can do for anything he is talking about. :D I can't measure what enormous amount of knowledge I have gained from all the discussions I have had with him. He is the one person who will never give up on you no matter what you do. He will always look into your side of the problem, the reasons for your actions. I have learned a lot from him which for which I will always owe him immense gratitude. It is the only thing I can offer him....
For all that you have done for me............ I love you Sid.
