<h1 class="page-title">SIDHARTH MEHTA</h1><p>Well,we became friends in second sem....and soon very good friends.At first I didn't like him much but soon he became one of my favourite. He's a "chill" type of guy. Never take tensions,except an hour before exam when realization dawns upon him.With speakers and disco lights on all the time in his room ,makes a good hangout place.He's very fond of getting late,you are all ready and you knock his room,thats when he realise he has to get ready.....conformation fact:brushes his teeth 5min before exam. And never trust him with any work until you want to mess it up! :P Thanks man for being a good friend...will miss all the good times together.May you  get all you desire.A happy life ahead.Good luck :) and be my friend forever!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shad-ahmad">Shad Ahmad</a></p>
<p>He is one of the most mast bandaas i know!! He and his boyfrnd can make me laugh for hours, their jodi is kamaal ki!! He is generally very lost, overly affectionate at times ( gtalk :P) Can't forget the niteout together, one of the most awesome nites (laughing for 5 mins, jaadu and basanti  :D ) and mahabaleshwar!!! I have shared two of my most unforgettable trips with this guy. A very fun person to be around, can be a little protective and very sweet at times and other times can be a total bitch!! :P He is a total party person and will never miss the chance of having fun..... His love for hukkah is bordering on obsession! and his speakers and disco lights are so awesome!! I always have fun with you and there are still a lot of chances for us to literally "hang out" :P !! mehte :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>
