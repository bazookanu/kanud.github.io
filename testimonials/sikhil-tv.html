<h1 class="page-title">SIKHIL TV</h1><p>Mama!! Now here's areally cool person. I got to know Sikhil mainly in 3-2, him being my lab partner.(In the first year, I actually called him 'Nikhil' a couple of times). He is a prominent person in AH3's right hand corridor, or as I like to call it, the 'Kovalam Strip'. Insanely witty, this guy is a genius. As the co-ordinator of the prestigious mime club, he is resourceful, a good leader, and an outstanding comedian..He shares my love for automobiles, and most of our lab talks revolve around the same topic :-D. Nice knowing you Mama. Keep in touch! All the Best !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>One of my best friends on campus.I think i met him for the first time during one of the ragging sessions. A really great guy to hang around with. Fun,helpful,modest and the heartthrob of a lot of girls on campus. He was one of the best coordinators of the mime club and gave it some of its best performances. But the thing i will always remember him for is the PJ's he used to crack and laugh all by himself  :P . Always keep in touch,even if u don't i will. Hope u always get the best the future has to offer.Have fun <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>

I thought i would give u a touching testimonial :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/seby-jacob">Seby Jacob</a></p>
<p>Sikhil TEEVEE!! The man with whom i got nominated for "best gay couple".. Many a times i have told this chap not to show his love in public :P... well jokes apart, an awesome friend, hearthrobe of most gals, very very ambitious, a lil hard working (ambition>>hard work), a lil bit too sleepy, a lil bald and interestingly slow hair growth rate, an amazing leader and much more.. that's sikhil. The first time I met him.. well don't call this gay.. is on bed.. when i woke up someday, this guy is sitting beside me in white tshirt, red track pants and talking with someone else! Whoever thought that this ass would be in each and every part of my BITS life! Inducted into mime club in our 1st year itself, he used to be my companion for going to meetings.  Although a little more serious than me, a small push was all he needed and you would see him playing around with others in the meetings. But he changed with the advices from seniors for good!! He became one of the best coordinators of the mime club!.. and a great actor too for that matter!! We have seen the toughest and the best times of the mime club together!! Same CG and where do we end up??.. same PS1 station!! another 54 days we spent in same appt and we hav seen all the cow dungs, all the mosquitoes, the ever fluctuating chennai current, the cruel Xavier (the guy @ the company), the most sensible and awesome tea guy, the shittiest food, the crowdiest places on earth, the hottest climate..together... yet reminiscing (yes this awesome word is in my vocab.. dankO dankO) about it!! Also his ambition to learn stuff and get good at it is commendable. Even with a million people standing and making fun of him or demotivating him, he would not get downtrodden by the discouraging visscitudes. He is also passionate about cars and automobiles (so is any LKG kid :P). Another amazing quality i have seen in him is that he will teach you anything really well if he has learned it... and yes he will teach it to you like teaching a kid. I will never forget this guy or the three quarters of my BITS life wandering with him!! Some bad qualities in him include making fun of me, making others make fun of me, lazy ass sleeping, not ever remembering to wake others up even if we tell him to, attracting girls (im sorry .. some of it was my contribution), stupidest jokes and subsequent self laugh etc. Although ill miss him the next sem.. we have one sem to rock with our piled up stipends :P and i will be kicking some ass if he sleeps a lot that last sem! Always remain same.. jus like ur hair!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charly-poul">Charly Poul</a></p>

<p>Sikhil - one of the most level headed guy among us (Well "level" headed literally also :D), he came to campus from hyderabad, and had escaped most of the ragging sessions. He is also from trivandrum, but our bonding began late in the EG practicals. He has been a superb friend ever since, always caring and helpful. He always thinks ten times before he acts.With his glamour, i am amazed that he hasnt accepted any of the thousands of proposals shot at him from girls of almost all years. His ambition is at the top. and he works hard towards that end. He works his ass off on anything he is interested in.
The mime club coordi, he is a great leader. We have pulled off many a hit shows under his leadership. His sense of humour is incorrigible, followed by his own stupid laughter (:D).  He has got the ability to keep almost all conversations alive with his ideas. :P. He is usually the person who teams up with mani to talk sense into us... :D. Weve had some great moments together. The long night-outs, the PK's rooms, the mime meetings,the kochi episode,  nothing will ever be forgotten. I hope we will always be in touch.Wishing u a lifetime of success and happiness.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/seby-jacob">Seby Jacob</a></p>

I think at least half my time in BITS was spent in the company of Sikhil, and it has never been boring. From 2-2 we’ve had all common subjects. He’s the first person I call every time I need help with something. The only reason I start studying before exams is because he constantly reminds me that exams are coming. And every time(which is almost always)  I fall sick he’s there to take me to the MED-C, bring me food, clean my vomit and shit XD etc. etc. And every time I bored I just walk into his room which is also our ‘common room’ (where people have seen us in questionable postures). It is just amazing to have him a friend. I love meddling with his mobile and FB acc. He give sme credit for making him a lot of friends :P He’s the only one in our group who’s been anywhere close to going for prom. We are all proud of him. He’s probably one of the best mime coordinators ever and put on some unforgettable shows. And the PJ’s may not be funny but it’s always a joy to watch that smug smile on his face after the jokes. So many memories, your cousin stories, the rapes in your room, your onam dance, the videos, the outings, nethravali, PS in that shithole, gossips, relaxing in your room, half night-outs in your room etc. etc. I just hope we’ll have PS together. Then after that we have one more sem to enjoy. After that , Keep in touch!
