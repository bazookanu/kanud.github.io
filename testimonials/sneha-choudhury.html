<h1 class="page-title">Sneha Choudhury</h1><p>I've known Sneha from MT2 labs. She is a very nice person to work with and is extremely helpful (i copied nearly all my reports from her :D). She is intelligent & knowledgeable and she is very caring in nature. I'll miss the time spent with her and i wish that she gets whatever she wants to achieve :)   BEST OF LUCK for the future sneha.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>Determined to get whatever she wants, emotional to the extent that can drive you crazy sometimes, she is one fireball :D How should I put this lightly..... she's very lively and full of energy to the point of becoming restless. (Now that's not a bad thing, I've seen her working on her project with incessant effort until she got her result.) Met her during the second year   and our friendship has grown stronger since. She's fun to hang around, you won't get bored around her for sure. She's a great friend, will listen to your problem very patiently( that's the only time when she shows this quality :P) We have had some epic discussions over totally random topics. She lives life on her own terms. She can be very mature at times and at times she'll behave like a 7 year old. I have had some great times with you. All the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>Sneha! A friend since 10th Grade. 6 Long years which just flew by. From the very beginning she has been very focused and determined towards her goals. Very studious (should say ;]) since eternity. She's been an amazing friend ever since the school year upto the today. Very helpful and should say extremely caring,(I remember my days in MED  C). Me not being dat sincere with acads always used her great help be it in our MT lab together or back in the school days. We had an amazing outing together in our 1st year to palolim. So to sum it all, I have had a great time with you all these years and would hope it to remain the same in future. Kudos to you for keeping our friendship alive for so long keeping in mind the kind of person i am ;) . Hope you achieve your goals for the future and do the best in your life which am quite sure you will with your dedication and determination to complete things! Stay the same friend you have been all these days! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pranay-agrawal">Pranay Agrawal</a></p>
<p>I've known Sneha since my first year. I got to know her through the Wall Street Club. We have worked together on organizing the Wall Street Fete, for Waves, and also for the Bengali New Year Dinner, every year. But apart from being just a 'colleague', she has been an awesome friend. We've had loads of fun together, in the campus, and at Bogmalo. ;-) And she's such a sweet, caring and fun person, it's been a pleasure, and an absolute joy to have been her friend. I wish her all the best and loads of success, in all her future endeavors.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/null">NULL</a></p>
<p>Sneha di.... The first word that comes in my mind is diligent. I have worked with her in organizing Wall Street Fete for Waves  and she is brilliant in organizing things and making events successful. A memorable experience of having her as a friend. A person who is extremely sweet at heart, and very helpful, I wish her all the very best for her future and hope she achieves success throughout her life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sanya-abbey">Sanya Abbey</a></p>
<p>Known Sneha as a fellow Bengali, she is the only one i have ever heard speaking bengali in the campus. Dont remember how we became friends (Was it advait or maanit as the common friend? i wonder). She is excellent in academics, a genius, hardworking and genuine girl. I hope her attitude takes her places. Good Luck. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Sneha is a very intelligent girl, and talk about hardworking.. oh my god. She is very helpful, caring, beautiful and talented. It's always lovely to have a chat with her. Working with Sneha is great (from the mt2 experience :P). Keep that attitude alive.. always. I wish you great luck for the journey ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-kumar-jha">Amit Kumar Jha</a></p>
<p>Ninni- the woman with the most pullable leg ever! Remember her the first time we met, it was like "are you sneha, the person who's got a contact in Nestle??" (It sort of started off on a DoSM-ish note, u know). Its been great knowing her since then, especially during that summer when guess we were the only ones who knew each other in the comp classes. Gtalk chats with her have always been epic, providing me with an outlet to use my wicked sarcasm in its full splendor. On a less sarcastic note, Ninni is a really sweet, surprisingly smart person (:P) and an extremely helpful person albeit a bit of a drama queen. Its been great knowing you over my BITS Life. Best of luck for the future and stay the way you are (which translates into "keep letting me pull your leg"). Cheers.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>Sneha is one of the most lively person i have ever meet. Just start talking  to her and you will feel like she knows you from years :). I got in touch with her in Wallstreet club and worked with her  in organizing  Wallstreet events in Waves  both the years. I will never understand how she manages to do soooo much of work with a smile on her face all the time,  seriously???  She is very caring, smart , frank and someone who is great to work with. It is really a great  to have you as a friend and a very supportive senior.Best of luck for your journey ahead. I don't think that I need to  wish you good luck in  life because no one can stop you form being successful...I just hope you will remember us all :)  BEST OF LUCK .

STAY IN TOUCH!!!! :)

<p>I have known this girl since school days. Everyone knows she is focused, hard working and determined and all that, but she is also childish, funny and fun-loving at the same time. It was totally unexpected that I would bump into her on coming to BITS. We actually grew very close and got to know each other much more than what we knew about each other before. I remember being terribly homesick in 1-1, but somehow in Sneha’s presence I would feel much less homesick… those group studies, watching movies together, sharing all our thoughts and feelings and dreams, consoling each other in bad times, all these memories have been etched at the back of my mind. Remember making charts to decorate your room with, Sneha? And cutting out pieces of cardboard for your wallstreet event? How well we came to know each other after all that! Sneha loves doing work (and getting work done :P). She always speaks her mind, and cannot keep a secret :P. She always has something to say, always has an opinion to give, about everything. She is confident in giving anyone an advice. Her opinions may change with time, but at that time she is very firm about whatever she does. She is an awesome entertainer… a very good mimic… sometimes she leaves you in splits… an upcoming hairstylist, (we both had planned to start a parlor some day :P, remember?)… she loves keeping long nails and painting them. That just shows her fetish for classiness… she has a sophisticated taste and loves dressing up. While she is giving you a serious advice she may seem very mature and intimidating, but she has a lovable child lurking inside her somewhere… those kiddish PJs, crying and whining over stupid things and stupid arguments with anyone over just anything possible, :) you will always remain a child Sneha. She has a sense of art that I admire; she loves music and has a sweet voice herself. I am so going to miss you Sneha… always keep in touch… Keep smiling and laughing, stay as crazy as you already are, I will always be there for you whenever you need me… Best wishes for everything and hope you get everything you want from life.        <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nisheeta-desai">Nisheeta Desai</a></p>
<p>Sneha…ninni…shoneha….kahaan se start karoon?? It’s such a long story…I first met sneha in SAC during room allotment, and I was a little intimidated by her. Here I was, hardly talking to anyone and there she was, who already knew half of the campus…cuz so many ppl from her school and classes ended up here only. Sneha is one of the very few people I know who know (and the only one amongst us, I’m still not sure what I want to do in future :P) what they want from their lives. When we were just new in the campus and getting used to our new surrounding and our newly found freedom, sneha already knew that she wanted to get into research and go for MS and all that. (I remember when she used to cry that she had to get into EEE to pursue her line of interest, and now look at you, almost set on your way to US) And the even more amazing thing was that she had already started preparing herself for that in various ways. It’s hard to find such a diligent, hard-working person who is so persistent in her efforts. 
Acads apart, she is an awesome person to be with, koi bhi impromptu plan ho, always count on her to back u up on that, never shies away from doing the craziest things and is always always ready to have fun. She is the only girl I know till now who has tried most of the varieties of alcohol (thts the level of bindaas I’m talking about), and thanks to her, I have, too, a few (:P). She was the first one of us to get a laptop in 1st sem, and we had the most amazing times watching movies on it. Our horror movie sessions became really famous in the hostel (as me and disha would scream our heads off throughout the movie). She is one person u should go to if u want to watch a new movie (she knows all the releases, old and new and whichever genre you want, god knows how!!) Her collection of accessories and sort has always come to my rescue in time of need (thank god for ur fashion passion :P :P). Bas Sneha se kabhi jhagda mat karna, OMG, uske baad to vo aisi hyper ho jaati hai ki corridor ke end tak u can hear her… Thank god I was never at the receiving end of her wrath (:P).  Her Hindi has improved a lot since she first came here (specially the gender distinction :P) thanks to me and kinu.. ;) nhi to uske gender confusion se hum confuse ho jaate the!! Agar kabhi uspe gussa bhi aaye to she’ll give u such a cute little baby smile ki kisi ka bhi gussa gayab ho jaayega.
 Sneha…u are such a darling. Bas mujhe bhool mat jana US jane ke baad aur hi-fi PhD researcher banane ke baad. Always keep in touch.. love u… Keep smiling ? ?

<p>A girl with a fixed goal set in her mind unlike many of us who choose to just go with the flow. I have never met anyone as dedicated and hard-working as her. One can learn a lot of things from her. A bold personality who has an amazing quality of managing people. I will always remember how before every exam she said “Akriti portion bahut hai, mera complete nahi ho payega” and she would be the first one to finish it. At last a word of caution: Never ever make her laugh during 2am – 4 am (peak time), it’s way too difficult to stop her after that :P. I will surely miss you in next semester. All the best for your life ahead and stay in touch :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akriti">Akriti</a></p>
<p>Snehaa..my beloved oppyy…That time is now a forgotten memory when I was sad because of not getting admission in Pilani campus. It could never have been possible without a friend like Sneha. She is the first person I met after coming to Goa campus and since then our friendship has blossomed. And I still remember her dad telling me “ don’t be sad, sneha will take care of you” and she never failed at it. An early impression that I formed of her was- she likes waking up early in morning everyday (including Sundays :P) and I became scared thinking how am I ever going to  fit in here living with people like her around me( :P)..but..but..after sometime I realized that we both had the same amount of love for sleep (:P :P). We both got a slide up to chemical engg, which was one of the most amazing thing that happened to me after coming to this campus. She was a close friend, my oppyy and now we were in same branch too, what more could I hope for?? A quality of hers that leaves an impact on you is her focus  on what she wants in life…well informed about everything,will surf the internet for hours searching for colleges for M.S. I really respect her for that.She is the only person I know who had firmly decided upon what she would be doing after college and is stuck to that today too. (how do you manage to  that!!)..Kudos to her!! I will never forget how she would always comment in the very beginning of the each  semester in a very cute manner-“ ye semester kitna kharab h”(:P)  ..how  her expressions are sometimes funny and the exact opposite of what you expect for the situation ( :P) ..the way she will crib about a course at the start and will end up acing it. Not at all nerdy and always has a bindass attitude, but when it comes to acads, she is very dedicated and hardworking. She has a natural talent for mimicry and is awesome at it( I wonder why she is not there in drama club)..from singing, dancing ,studying (even crying abt acads for that matter :P), hair-styling to organizing events for wall street and what not,no one can beat this girl!! She is good at almost everything she does.  Another good quality she has is that she is frank and will never hesitate to put her opinion forth…..when looses temper, she can shout on you nicely and I am sure you will regret making such a lovely person angry( try it at ur own risk ( :P ) chemical classes that we attented  together, combined study(where some times she never stops laughing –remember, PDD :P :P) to gossips, watching vampire diaries or movies, laughing and crying together, we had our share of wonderful time and I will never forget that. Cant imagine anyone else living in the room in front of me..God, I am so used to waking up and knocking on ur door!! My journey in Bits would  neverhave been same without you. Wont say stay in touch coz vo to hum rahenge hi. I sincerely hope she gets the college of her choice and her hard work pays. I know she will be very successful in life.love you loads..
Ps : don’t turn into a kharoos prof if you take up teaching sometime!! (:P)
