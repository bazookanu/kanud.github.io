<h1 class="page-title">Snehil Srivastava</h1><p>GUNA ka Hero :) He is indeed. I don't know much about Snehil except for the fact that he is one of those awesome people who do well in exams and do they do it silently. He is dedicated and works persistently to achieve his goals. I have enjoyed his company and I wish him all the best for his future. Enjoy & keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Snehil has been one of my first and closest friends on campus. Very easy to go and fun loving person who has given me really good company when it came to acads( you know wat i mean :P). Have soo many fantastic memories with him, be it playing TT in common room and representing the hostel during slam or our 2v2 matches of FIFA or the more recent and the most epic of all, playing BFME on lan. One thing I will really miss about you in the future is having those loong discussions about football, debating about teams and their respective chances and what not in the corridor along with Saikat. I wish you all the best for your future, do stay in contact and be the way you are :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>snehil came across as a  simple, modest, a really grounded and down to earth fellow. a victim of destiny (like me!), he isn't quite clear what he really wants from life! :D :D
very soft spoken, he can mingle with anyone and charm them with his sweet smile. 
he loves football and a fan of Hollywood gangsta flicks. i loved discussing those with him. he's one of those fellows who doesn't have their set of ego problems and thus holds no grudges.
though he has his set of conspiracies and stories (Bata store and Baroda) ;P 
i'd cherish the countless moments spent laughing with him, be it in Saikat's room (he wont let us enter his), or the beach excursions to Palolem, Agonda, Uttorda et. or Vasco and esp Doodhsagar! :) 
All the luck for your future. we'll rock 4-2!
P.S.: yea  i'll remember ur birthday, but do u remember mine? :P

<p>Snehil Srivastava. Immensely simple and down to earth and a very modest person. A dear friend and someone who will always give a ear to listen to no matter what you have to say. I realised him as a friend very late though (i think in 3-1 only) when we started doing our CDC's together. Someone who is extremely hard-working and will do all in his capacity to achieve a goal he has set for himself. Snehil is a popular guy owing to his sweet charming smile and soft-spokenness. I will remember the combined study sessions we had in our 3rd year (which pretty much often ended up being disastrous for us the next day in the exam ;).  I must say that by now I am pretty much tired of writing "You  have a long way to go" and all that for everyone else :P. So let me be frank. Being a little late bloomer here at BITS I must say that I was pretty amazed to see that you came this far :P :P. (Just kidding :D) He is a real gem of a mechanical engineer and he sure will do great. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
