title: Sonali Bhadra

<h1 class="page-title">Sonali Bhadra</h1><p>There's an overwhelming amount of memories that come dashing through my skull, so I'm not able to fix on a start. So it all started when I started helping you out with your JEE Math huh :D Man, what a journey this has been.
You've been a lifeline for me here, the reason I started attending classes (to a smaller extent) and bunking (to a larger extent, thanks to your cryptic notes :D). Now I've always had this view of an ideal girl I'd wanted : straight hair, avg height, calm and sweet, someone with a taste for music, non-nerd etc.Weirdly, not even one of them is present in you, yet you've defined my life at BITS :)
I know I've never said this but you're sweet in your own way (when you ask for cadbury shots :D), and you've been mighty helpful with all the acads (the CN assignments, the explanations before exams, giving notes etc :D).
There are a lot of memorable moments I've had the pleasure of having, because of you. 
Monginis mein pastries	
IC ke dinners	
Dominos treats	
Night Canteen	
Bench near C Mess	
Bench near my hostel	
HQ under extreme poverty conditions :P	
Daily Bread ka burger and sandwich	
Kashi ka paav bhaji	
Ginza ka ghatiya pasta :D	
Library :D	
Gosh. Every place in the campus reminds me of you :D Leaving you will be all emotional and senti :( I so wish campus life never ends. But paise kaun kamaayega tujhe treats dene :X	
Apart from all these, you are a big nerd (:P), sweet, caring, wonderful, lootne-wali (:P), bekaar jokes pe hasne waali (:P), beautiful inside out :D
And for God's sake, please improve your Hindi :P.	
" Paach baje lib mein milenge :P "   
"Chcheen baje tak SE khatam kar lete hain"   
"Mein aa jaoogi"
"Haaaayn" (ur Bengali haan :P)	

You've been an absolute pleasure, and my limited vocab is running out of superlatives to describe the time we've spent. I am, and will, stay on your side. Always.

Love,

<p>Well, you can recognize her in a dark pitch night by her voice. She is just a lovely person to be with and a very hard working one too. Its always a joy to get to spend some time with her as her contagious smile is something that will diffuse any tension you are having in your mind. She is great with acads and every other things she does. All the best dear, may you have really great and successful life ahead. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>

<p>Sonali is a very hardworking girl as is known to everyone.I need not elaborate again about her acads or her dedicated work for BITSAA.
We had some very good memories together in EPS class.She used to speak at lightning speed and ma'am used to remind her again and again to work on "intonation"! :D It took us a lot of time to find out what that word means. Also after every T1 and T2 she used to visit me asking for my papers so that she could see where she went wrong.At the end of the semester she had mastered her speed of speech immensely.This shows her sincerity even in a subject like EPS......Like some1 above, I too feel that she has beautiful features and a lovely smile...... She is very innocent and lively..... And I still remember the incident of  "pea paratha(pun intended)" at Kashi.... don't you Sonali?It still makes me laugh!!.... hope you keep up d spirit of your hardwork!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>

<p>Sonalii!! She is a really sweet person. Both of us belong to the same family-IS family. She is always ready to help and we share the same corridor. All our corridor chit-chats, cursing teachers, asking if there was a test in a class and then realising both of us missed that class :P, our IS trips to doodhsagar and arambol were sum of the moments shared with her. She has a always been a great person to tok to and not to miss, she is excellent when it comes to acads. A very hard working and sincere person. It was great coming across a person like you. Wishing you all the very best in future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Bhadra!!! One of those few “Nerd Queens”, but with a well active social life than any of them. She’s one of those funniest girl in IS, with an everlasting smile. The 1st time I saw her, I thought who’s this girl with this weird looking hair..aarrgghh….then slowly I realised that she’s the super nerd queen(in my 1-2). It was in 2-1 that I realized I’ve made many bad assumptions about this girl!!!On the contrary, of what I thought, she’s an extremely outgoing girl, friends with many ppl on the campus. It was QUARK-2011 that made us friends…I can never forget that Event(One thing I’m extremely happy about is tat one)…ryt from it’s proposal..cancellation…reconsider…long hours of brain storming…at the end aaww…the final success…thanks to you!!! It was during that time when we used to discuss about many other things, which mainly included Vampire Diaries..she’s a diehard fan of VD, I think she’s still watching it for Daemon Salvatore (:P). Just like me, she also has that vampire expression on her face sometyms(I still hav tat pic :P). Sometimes I used to mention her as “air hostess” because of the way she speaks(it’s lyk 10Xthe speed at which “normal” human being speaks :P )…but yeah these days she’s far better(I must have got used :P). The way she code is amazing, it’s so structured and proper. Bhadra is a very helpful girl, she is always ready to give her notes when u need it(take it at ur own risk, u can’t understand the handwriting :P). It was really wonderful having you as a friend, and I just hope this goes on forever..do stay in touch :). And come to campus next sem, we can go on that never existing trip of ours :D :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srinivasa-lahiri">Srinivasa Lahiri</a></p>
