<h1 class="page-title">Sourav Banerjee</h1><p>Sourav!! What can I say about this guy? I have personally known him for 17 years at the time of writing this testimonial. Even in school he was an alpha nerd and he has kept it up in college. A very endearing and down to Earth guy who laughs, plays and eats a lot (a LOT). I hope he has a great life and career ahead of him.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>

<p>Sourav... A guy who is always cheerful and ever ready to make fun of any and everyone he finds around him... he is the kind of guy who everyone loves and i am sure no one minds (not many anyway :P ) ... he is extremely easy to start a conversation with ...start one in hindi and you are sure to be entertained for quite some time... his ever smiling face is what i will always remember... Despite the fact that i have known him for quite some time now...i have not once seen him lose his temper... he maintains him calm even when the whole of chemistry is stressing over vivas and reports... All in all it has been a pleasure knowing you sourav... and i hope all your dreams come true!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>Banerjee the sweet smiling bong innocent looking ( at first sight he reminded me of the priest at the kali temple back home :P ) but these three years definitely prove that he is not all that innocent ; but yeah an eccentric bong to the core from relishing soccer to the many his many ballads of extravagant  peth pujas this manush does everything in style ! BUT you should see him in the library in the early class hours ; he will be in focus with his self claimed dreaded subject Chemistry ! The B- school embroyo in him probably using those the enthalpies of those complex reactions to grow :) From him making fun of my futile attempts of ridiculing him in Bengali to me ridiculing him for oscillating between his 'sohag' and my kaarti ( it took some while for him to reduce the' my' content) these three years have been insane and shall be cherished ! let the good times roll for ever :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>
<p>Sourav is one of the most polite guys I've ever known. Though we haven't interacted much but I cherish the moments we have spend together playing football. A good defender and a gifted futsal keeper, its been great being his team mate during one futsal tournament. I wish you all the very best for the future.
