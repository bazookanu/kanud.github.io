And I am soo happy for him that he got a right one to walk hand in hand with for life time.  :)  Its been really good to have such a thoughtful, philosophical intelligent and ambitious friend ( really proud you know) .

<p>Physics is perhaps the 1st thing that comes to ur mind when u see him.But for me he's more than just that.He's a thinker( such people r a scarcity ).Even better than his understanding f physics is his understanding of human nature and emotions. He always has the right words to boost ur morale, to get u going. He's a true friend and he'll be by ur side always to encourage and inspire u to achieve great things. He’s been a defining factor in whatever I’ve done and achieved in last few yrs.I can rightly say that u hv changed my life and vision completely(might have even saved me from getting lost in the web of hopelessness & despair)(and yeah hope includes Count Of Monte Cristo, and I’m thinking abt reading Fountainhead).Infact, if not for u, I might not have even come to BITS.I once said to him that I wished I could emulate him, and I think I’m still trying that(although in a different way now). And i recently discovered that he's got a hell lot f creativity too(if u know wht i mean, D). He's one f those few persons who believe that nothing is impossible.5 yrs wid him have been one helluva ride. We had countless moments of stomach wrenching laughter( u sure remember all that we did in +2, D), and i wish many more to come……<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhishek-kumar">Abhishek Kumar</a></p>
<p>This is one testimonial, writing which I had to think. Not think what to write but where to start..!! To start off, let me tell you that I’ve known this guy only for 1 year ( so what im going to write might be all wrong .. :P jk). Guys like Souvik are very hard to find- Intelligent, caring, trust-worthy, cheerful, philosophical and super-talented. I had known him earlier as just some 9-pointer, but there’s more ,there’s a hell lot more in this guy but I guess only his close friends would know that. Just think of the most intelligent person you’ve known in your life- he’s more intelligent than that; think of the most fun-to-be-with guy you know, he’s better than that. He’s a complete person. A lot of amazing times I’ve spent with him (kayaking in palolem with that Brazilian babe :P, uttorda and how can I forget Doodhsagar..!!). I know many more such outings await us. Had some long philosophical talks with him, He’s probably the only guy who I can share things on so many levels. I won’t talk about his love for Physics, even people who don’t know him can say that stuff. He cares a lot for his friends and puts a honest effort to solve their problems. He understands people’s emotions so well that you cant hide anything from him. That’s all for the serious part man. He has a newfound love for metal & rock music and has already developed some great taste. Also a big fitness freak, does a lot of exercises in his room, eats in a very calculated manner (>.<). Another one of our AAOC study-partner.. Amazing times we had man this one year.  I know you’ll make it real big in whatever you pursue and also I know you’ll keep in touch no matter what. Stay Awesome..!! ?  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-krishna-kant">R Krishna Kant</a></p>
<p>Souvik Dutta aka dutta pawle aka dutta down the line 6 years living happily with his two loves. One mrs dutta, other ob physics. I still remember my 1st week in bits when I need shoes for workshop lab and I need to go out to buy and I need someone to accompany me and every person I know till that time had made an excuse of swine flu. One person whom I met in mess at dinner just one night before going to Panjim got agreed to go out with me. That person is no one other than Dutta. I am still thankful to Dutta for that trip. Times passes, we realized that our frequency matches a lot and he becomes one of my best friends with whom I shared each and every moment of life either happy or sad. He always been a motivation for me in studies as he is phodu with phodu C.G. He is man with lot of courage and I have lot of respect for his courage and intelligence. This chapter of my life has a full bag of memories and moments spend with dutta which I will cherish all my life and will never forget including a finest trip of North India and various sexy bike trips of 200km in goa and how can i forget our dinners at martin's corner. He is a man who follows his passion and lives for his passion. His philosophy towards life is quiet admirable and I really appreciate that and that’s why he is going to convince my future father-in-law and my father for my marriage. :P I really love you buddy. You made my life. Without you this bits life can’t be possible and I got some of my life’s long friends here in bits and one of them u. you really rocks. My all goof wishes with you for your happy future and may god give you strength to sustain EEE CDC's.:P Will really miss you a lot. All the best..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-goel">Amit Goel</a></p>
<p>Dutta, man... what to say about you. Your knowledge and passion for physics is just simply great. Still a very humble, calm and low profile image is what you carry. You love the things you do and thats just the way it should be. Always willing to help out frns and be with them in times of need. Knowing you was great.. All the best mate, may you scale the heights of success with your hard work and passion.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
