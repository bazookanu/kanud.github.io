<p>SK my neighbour...our hostel's, no, 

our campus' very own Anna Hazare. Any 

CSA-related initiative being spammed 

on DC, you can safely bet your money 

on this guy being behind it, whatever 

nick he's hiding behind at that time. 

MangoMan has been an excellent 

neighbour, lives peacefully and lets 

live peacefully. Always has returned 

my kettle on time, so that's a big 

+ve about him. His room has been a 

great source of sweets, cloves and 

other edibles for a long time. One of 

my favourite pastimes include popping 

into his room and talking loads of 

random stuff about any damn thing on 

this earth - politics, girls, acads, 

campus stuff, girls, you get the 

drift. A great follower of yoga, sri sri sri ravi shanker (or whoever), Yes+, No- etc etc., he is fast on his way to join Baba Ramdev's camp at present speeds. He has always been a source of 

informed opinion, mostly well-thought 

of, and he generally keeps himself 

well informed of all the stuff that 

goes around. His ridiculous white-

and-red paedophile Santa towel 

notwithstanding, he has been a value addition to this corridor and has helped in making some of my memories about this place special.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>talkative!! he is one person who can start a talk with anyone...widout even knowing them...!! actually i really admire the ease with which u start a conversation with any stranger and the sort of connect u build with them.... :) crakes silly jokes, speaks his heart out, argues a lot :P ,extremely helpful...(goes out of his way to help others...) and a kid at heart...

<p>SK, ppl used to call him like dat when they saw me calling him like dat..But this was not new to me since we were classmates from +2 ,our +2 college mates used to call him like dat..He was there with me from almost mre dan 5 years...I know him as person who helps others, and more interested about politics , civils and stuff..People generally dsnt find me and him hanging out together much, although we were classmates from 12th. But internally we know about each other very well and we support each other secretly, but many others dsnt knw abt it :P The way of life which we love is a bit different, dats y i feel we dnt actually roam together but we r there for each other from many years..Actually i feel he wnt leave me, like hutch add, whereever i go he follows me :P As an example i can say my rum no for next sem is ch1 146 nd his was 147..presently it was AH4 202 nd 203 :P I see him as a leader , who actually was the major reason for the participation of many ppl in yes+ course..He is a completely different person and i feel he wants to see him very differntly from others..The best thing which i like in him is , his love towards the country and he evrytime feels he has to do smething for the nation.. I hope i will see him as a great inspiring citizen for the country and all the best for his carrier which ever might be the field he opts..And i dont want to ask him plz be in touch :P cause sure he will be there with me  throught my life as i already said where ever i go he follows :P keep smiling :) and great future ahead my dear :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raj-shekar">Raj shekar</a></p>
<p>The man who can talk through an entire GD by himself. Sai is a one of a kind person who enjoys what he enjoys and ignores everything else. He is an enjoyable person to be around and always has a funny wise-crack to offer. I hope he enjoys himself in whatever he does.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/udit-dewan">Udit Dewan</a></p>
<p>SK... everybody calls him SK... even our teachers.. he is a fun loving person who never fails to make you smile... half the time he is completely clueless about whats going on and it is a complete pleasure to see that innocent cute look on his face :) ... his way of speaking hindi is totally hilarious... he can never sit idle.. he just has to be doing something...always ready to face the challenge... SK loves talking...and has his own views about everything under the sun, which makes it really easy to talk to him... also he is an extremely down to earth guy.. who gets emotional easily ( he even takes the chemistry teachers seriously when they tell us how useless we are :P ) ... You, my friend are one of the most humble people i have met.. u deserve the best in life...All the best !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>

<p>SK ....he is one of the most dynamic guys i have met. Keeps himself up to date with all the happenings worldwide. Is one of the most talkative persons and there is never a dull moment when he is around. He made those boring CE labs(which he takes very seriously) fun with his inimitable sense of humour. He can come up with some of the most brilliant ideas when it comes to CW. Someone who enjoys every moment and is a wonderful person. Looking forward to spending another fun filled year with you .!! wish you all the best!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/omkar-kaskar">Omkar Kaskar</a></p>
<p>SK, and more popularly known as Posani, courtesy Ugadi 2012, I am really glad to have met this dynamic person whose creativity knows no limits and can make you laugh even when you want to cry! Even though we knew each other from the beginning, it was being partners in crime and Ugadi celebrations that sealed our friendship. I will never forget the post farewell discussion and photo-session in my life, in spite of receiving not one but two death threats, for I am sure, if I die, he will be giving me company and I can imagine HP and the Lady IPS plotting the murder this very instant!

<p>SK... I feel like I met him yesterday. He is very caring, loving like a big brother..(ya hits like a big brother..:P). He is very dedicated in what ever he is doing. Always love the long chats, gossips etc with him.. He is a total time pass guy who will help you in any situation. I owe big time to SK for waking me up for the surprise tests..:D. He is one of the most enthusiastic   guy in our campus and has a spiritual side also. I wish him all the best for his future...:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mani-ram">Mani Ram</a></p>

<p>SK!! I've had really good memories of having some interesting, funny and deep discussions - all by the stairs in AH4. What haven't we discussed?? Cracking random jokes at random ppl and each other as well :P.... Movies, telugu movies, filmstars (oh yes, he is a Die hard fan of Tamanna! ), changing the system, karma and philosophy, cricket, languages ( of course, the hilarious version of Tamil that you speak :P), music and what not.......
One thing that connects us both is the restlessness .......both just can't b idle n yes that made us share a lot of ideas too! N of course, unlike many others, SK is one person who can laugh at jokes being cracked on him! Your optimism amazes me! You'll go a long way with your ideas..... jus make sure you stick to one and work on it!! :)
Always be this active peppy person that you are!! Don't change that for anyone!!

<p>SK!!! Where do i start ?? The first thing that comes to mind when you think about SK is how funny at the same time how stupid can he be. His ethics, his passion, his principles are all outstanding. He is a kid at heart but mature enough to give you philosophical lectures :P. I'm kidding, he is very helpful, intelligent, stupid, immature, funny and spiritual. He practices yoga and meditation in his room to keep his composure. A sincere Art of living follower and he literally ate my head off till i joined art of living :). He's a gem of a person, very rare to find and very precious to lose(srsly ? >.<). All the best SK.

<p>SK! .. A truly very vibrant and distinct personality,whose company and support I've really enjoyed all these years.The nights we spent mugging for exams,or chatting about all kinds of nonsense,I really will miss all those moments.A voracious reader,and an enthusiastic orator,you are great company to discuss anything that my crazy head churns out,be it tv series or random campus gossip.You've tolerated all kinds of crap from me,and for that I'm really grateful.Yaar,you've been a great support to my craziness,and are one of the core reasons I've pulled through some of the toughest inner challenges life threw my way.You've accepted every bit of my craziness,be it about classes,tests,girls,life,pizza,TV series or just wierd ol' me.I truly admire your dedication to causes close to heart.Your honesty,simplicity and sincerity are something that I will always admire.
All I wish for the future is that we grow stronger together. :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
