<h1 class="page-title">Srihari Sankar</h1><p>Hari ! I have had many of my best moments with you. I would never forget the ragging session in the first yr, the applause from seniors for the 25 words and the play we enacted :D ! He is a great programmer, loves physics, tennis, football .. I enjoyed  all the debate the have had - badminton(or volleyball) Vs tennis. And remember my kicking your ass in squash ! Poor guy, din dare to play with me ever again ! :P And the countless bets that u have lost :D ! And a stone hearted guy who sometimes (most of the time) doesnt get human emotions! - Remember 3:10 to Yuma & Conviction ( i guess) :D .  IITM & IITK fest's Unforgettable ! That night of coding at kharagpur with Shabbar shivering and all - Epic times ! And U lazy ass still havnt changed ur email ID, this reminds me the expression of Satija when he heard your ID :D ! And my PS would have been literally HELL without man ! The broken air cooler, nights of insomnia, food hunt and not to mention the Envoys electronics and those trips to Taj Mahal, Mathura, Amritsar ! We did the great Himalayan Ride and those moments can never be put in words, at one point we were scared to death literally ! We owe that pulsar a BIG one !! Whenever i see those pics, I find myself in high spirits ! I m so glad I had you to share it with ! It has been a hell of a journey man and I would cherish all the great times we have had ! I wish you could have been there in the last semester ! But anyway we will definitely stay in touch ! And don't you dare forget the bet and may i suggest start saving up from now coz u owe me a fortune :D ! Cheers to all the great time we have had and a successful career ahead !  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anantaram-varatharajan">Anantaram Varatharajan</a></p>
