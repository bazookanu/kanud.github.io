<p>I met this small little girl outside mess when she came from hyderabad with her parents (a week after my admission)... She was not the one to begin conversation, her mom did! Her mom was asking me and pooja if we were also freshers.. and this girl just told her name and branch (answered to the point).. We became close thanx to the chemical classes... Srija is called by various names like "little girl", "srija madam", "F", "Candy" and what not!! :P She attends most of the classes and is very good at studies... But she gets tensed up before exam and cries(not literally) after getting papers... (once she was crying she ll get B in her favourite MTO, when she had scored well and got A finally) She has managed her acads along with BITSAA work... The time spent in MT2 and MTO/FFO lab will always be remembered... Also climbing on the 'chillar' plant was great fun ;) May you get what you wish for and reach your dream "height" of success :P :)

<p>Srijaaaaaa.....one of my 1st frnds on campus! Had a really memorable time with you in 1st sem. Me, you and divya used to sit in the library all through the day. N from the starting only, i admired you for your sincerity towards studies :) u are a great teacher, i must tell you. You explain things so well. I still miss your teasing me with some non-existent guy(whom you named "gautam", i dont noe why :P maybe hes ur crush ;):P) haha....but u can be really funny at times and serious at others. You are great person, always chilled out and really hard-working. You know when to have fun and when to work. All the awesome moments spent with you will always be missed. And i wish you great success in life. May you get whatever you wish for. Keep in touch! :):)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Srija..crazy ,cute,pretty,soft,pleasant,affectionate,intelligent,smart,amiable,charming,lovely,little gal..Sometimes childish too... The first time i met her, we were getting ragged near b-dome.Later on our bonding got stronger and made srija , one of my best 4nds ..BIts has given me such a wonderful 4nd with whom i can fight a lot and can share anything ..She is my guru.She taught me many things and clarified me many of my doubts (though i piss her off with my stupid doubts) . She helped me in evry situation of my life. She has very good taste. I take her advice whenever i buy something...She doesnt even switch off her l8 during n8 may be becoz of her n8 mares..Smtimes calls me even at 2 in d n8..Hope you will be courageous, atleast in future:P.. she is a very good actor too...U... in short film you \m/.especially in flashback as a child .. you look soooo cute ... she directed me many times when i was in a confused state. We spent most of the time gossiping... CMng to studies she is very dedicated ,hard working and at the same time, enjoys each moment of her life. She always teases me.NOt even a single day goes without fighting wth u ...Very sweet to every1 except me...Loved the days we spent together.Wanna see you in ISB..and have great future a head...A very good luck for future.. gonna miss you a lot.. love u!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ramya-teja">Ramya Teja</a></p>
<p>Sriijaaa Reddy! The one who came up wid candy is ma favourite person!! Srijaa , I remember you from the time , when i first met you outside your rum, and you wer like 'My parents are still here, but m still homesick' I really found that funny.I dint knoe u at all until in 2nd yr and now I know you better , cuz I hav also inspected you rum , lived in it while you were gone.(seriously, the amount of cosmetics she has and god knoes what she does with dem!!) Srijaa is fun and  very childish.God , what would have I done without you!!!!!! And the Kisses we shared !!!! how cud I forget1!! :P :P I would write more on that, but you would start blushing den.!! her rum is just reflection of mine, with specially during compre times turning into just piles of clothes in every inch of it! Sriiiija is hardworking definitely, not a person to mess wid during compre (for that , thre is always Ramya!!) really funny, gossips hell lot once the gossiping session starts :P You introduced me and made me watch  videos like sheila!! So, you can see the best of srijjaaa only just after test or compree !! :P   And it was really fun and amazing knowing you all these years!! What will i do without you last sem!! You have a great future ahead!! I know!! and always believe in yourself!!

<p>Srija!! My bestest friend on campus. Met her right in the first year. Then she was just a cute, little nerd to me. Only memory of that time seems to be reading thermo in candlelight(or was it an emergency lamp?)But but, the thing about Srija is there is so much depth to her personality, you can't just judge her off in a single stroke. 3 years on and I'm still finding new things about her. Which is what I love about her, she has this capacity to surprise people, especially after they think they know her very well. So, if you've read her testimonials, you know now that she has this deceptive appearance of being quite but she actually is very mischievous, more so than any of us. And her comic timing! Brilliant! She's come a long way from not understanding most of our jokes to the one who is making ones that crack us up all the time. For which, of course, I take most of the credit. Sometimes I feel Srija is perfection personified. As a person and actions too.How she manages her studies perfectly(while listening to music that too! O and it was her music that kept going the time my hard drive crashed), and I don't see any mugging either is amazing.(Tiny mention of how long she can sleep. Like forever. Which I noticed when she came to my house ) . O yeah, I started watching BBT because of her.(But I can't stretch it to Modern Family :P)She is extremely lovable, fiercely loyal to her friends, honest, this maybe a bit surprising considering she sleeps with her light on but, brave. Yes, I think courage is so much more than that. I say this despite the debacle at the scary house. :D. I think we're the first ones in the history of mankind to not even make it beyond the first 10 feet. Not even the second time. O and she's a true blue shopper. The best shopping companion anyone can have. She's enthusiastic, her honesty will sure come in handy, a good sense of judgement, if something costs more than it should, there will be no caving in on her part and most importantly good taste. Her wardrobe is proof to that. An incredible number of outfits, most importantly she wears them all! I didn't think that was possible for anyone before I met her. See I told you about her judgement. Nothing she would regret buying later. And she has all these quirky habits that make her company so enjoyable. Her pulupu(sorry, don't know the english word) cravings and her love for the sour is in perfect accordance to her personality. Don't ask me to explain how though :P. The way she pops gulab jumans into her mouth, I tried that and almost choked to death. And the cute way she messes up her shirt or her arms while eating. True perfection has to be bit imperfect, right? Or the way she says kodta for :D So cute :P. And our gtalk status messages in reply to each other's and her penchance to always keeping a busy status. There are so many things, I can't possibly go into all of those. I've been putting off writing this for that very reason, I was afraid I'll miss out on stuff but I'm sure I still have and will smack my head two days later. A Bits biography would be good, I think. We've had so much fun these three years.The manipal trip and a special mention to the latest ones : how we jumped the VHG gardens so nonchalantly and how you patiently bore me out the night after pentagon :P And I still maintain I wasn't trying to hit people "there". And the karoke night we had, on the beanbag outside with shreya and of course the perfect pappucharu that I'll remember for many years to come.
 I used to be apprehensive about being in a girl gang, because of all the bitchiness that’s abound but you have proved to me that girls can have healthy friendships too. Thank you for that . I am glad to have met someone so lovable and to have her as a friend, someone who loves life so much, that it rubs off on you :D. Here’s to the awesome last sem we’ll have. Looking forward to the mentoring :P. Friends for life. PS : I’ll call you.
