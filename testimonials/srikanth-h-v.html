<h1 class="page-title">SRIKANTH H V</h1><p>One thing that strikes me about Srikanth would be the calmness across his face no matter what the situation is.A very soft spoken guy and always sporting a smile.His zest for adventure is unparalleled.The best trip organizer I have seen ( A big thank you for those trips!!!) .Extremely religious.A real brainy fellow and a GOD of electronics and coding.Extremely helpful and a very loyal friend.There would never be a dull moment around him.I would remember the amazing conversations we have had and the times we have spent together.Really happy that you were a part of my life in this campus and I wish you a life full of success and happiness. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>shrikant is always out there and making things happen. will never forget the ugadi dinner you organised for us. you sir, don't need a degree to be anything, you are one genius by yourself. You have taught me more in the last minute exam rumblings than some instructors in their whole terms! The most practical guy i know, and i will never stop looking upto you for that. come what may, shrikant will be out there, rocking things and taking life HEADS ON!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/supriya-kajjidoni">Supriya Kajjidoni</a></p>
<p>Its funny that when I saw Srikanth for the first time I assumed H stands for Hyderabad. Anyways, since than began our EIIT lab sessions and since then began the short but tumultuous yet fulfilling friendship that I have had with Sriks. Although he did not fully participate in many of our rebellious acts mostly cause he is nerdy (which he vehemently denies), his presence always ensured that our marks in the lab would be adequate to avoid an E. Outside, he is a good chatter (not as good as me though :D), has a commendable general awareness, terrific 'practical' electronics acumen and lamentable dressing sense :P. Hope you have utilized my fashion tips, but more importantly I hope you make a career in the Defense Services. And keep smiling, the way you always do.
PS: I had no idea you provided last minute tuition, book one slot for me please.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paparazzi">Paparazzi</a></p>
<p>A calm, friendly and soft-spoken person, Srikanth will always greet you with a smiling face. A person with cool, calm demeanour, he also has a rather sporty out-ward facet to his personality which he depicts through his gestures, and way of talking. May you scale all the heights in future! (while flying a Su-30 obviously :D ) All the very best for your future endeavours! :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>
<p>Srikant is one of my most adventurous friends..very bold and always willing to take risks...highly  opinionated and might i say a bit "socialist" in his temperament,a regular visitor to the NC....gets along well with people can befriend people effortlessly.....your ability to face adversities with calmness has been an inspiration to me.....i sincerely wish you do get into the armed forces,about which you are so passionate about....will always remember the heated discussions we've had...well at least a couple of them...i will always cherish all those the visits to the NC,the "bench" and all those trips we took(yana.. \m/est of all....thanks for taking me....) ...all the best,have a great future ahead!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-ramanan">Paritosh Ramanan</a></p>

<p>I don't know if I can match up to his level of god-like testimonial writing but let me give it a novice shot :P Passionate, punctual, ES pro, vocabulary expert and most of all a great guy is who Srikanth is :) I had an awesome time with him in TRW classes (often mocking the teacher :P) and making those presentations and reports was definitely one of my top class BITS experiences. We did share that early morning bathroom ritual :P in the first year along with Nankar the great :P I am gonna miss being around him and occasionally talking to him about things ranging from acads to Airforce. His future is going to be so wonderful that he is gonna reach for the skies :) I wish him all the very best from the OCD heart of mine ;P Enjoy and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>The first time I saw Srikanth was back in Bangalore, before BITS, where we attended the same coaching institute for a few days. One could imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw him sitting in the same line to get the ID pic clicked. He is one of the strongest characters I have met who will overcome anything to achieve what he wants. He has amazing focus and is very clear on what he wants in life (a quality I wished I had). A very helpful person ready to go out of his way to get someone out of trouble. 
Srikanth has been instrumental in gelling our Kannada group together. The very ambitious trips arranged (400km in a day to a neighbouring state is no small feat), the fantastic Ugadi feast bear testimony to his ability to plan and execute things to perfection. We have had endless discussions on aircrafts, history, politics, religion and other random things under the Sun (there was once an incident where our conversation went on from 8pm to 4am in a train :D ). I had the most memorable trips with him and the Kannada gang. A witty, cheerful, level headed person and an amazing driver. A genuine and loyal friend. Here's wishing him the very best for his future. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
<p>Though we've known each other for a little more than a semester, Srikant's been a great friend and we've bonded really well in a short period of time. He's soft spoken,kind, very down to earth and probably one of the most helpful people on campus. He also has a penchant for adventure and outings  (one of which I'm eagerly awaiting :P)--which makes him a perfect travel buddy. Always calm and composed, his cheerful demeanor is refreshing, especially during stressful times . He also organized a delicious ugadi dinner and I'm very thankful to him for inviting us.  I'm grateful that I get to count such a humble and fun loving person as a friend. I wish him the best of luck for his future and here's to more planned/unplanned trips together ! ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayush-sanyal">Ayush Sanyal</a></p>
<p>H V....as he is known to me...is one of those guys who was rarely seen in the hostel outside his room in first year (even to this date, he is rarely seen) . "PRO" is what he calls me, and has even written to me. But, the fact is, this guy is the REAL electronics pro, whose knowledge is much beyond what we can expect. He was the guy who used to fodufy   subjects like ES, microelectronics and other EnI CDCs. During mane's assignments, his room would be as if some "CADENCE coaching classes" were in progress (that too, free of cost :P). Humble and soft spoken as he is, he is one of those "silent pros" of the hostel, who don't like to show off their skills.  He is probably supposed to be the 'dude' in the kannada sangha, which is pretty visible from the testimonials from the entire sangha to him. And talking about deadly combo pairs, He and Pavan(from IS), are the 2 pals that keep discussing, debating and researching over some recent topics on technology. sometimes, this group extends to suhas as well. this is something that still drives fear in me. so srikanth, thats a deadly combo pair (and not me and paris  :| ).  coz, u might not be a member of sincere gang, but proness is what matters in the end. I will remember him as one the good guys on campus i've met!! Wishing u best of luck for your future!!

<p>The one thing that you notice about this guy, is the calm, ever-smiling face, and the confidence he shows. My first friend on campus, just a few rooms away, he has been the first target for my non-stop bitching around, be it about profs, the education system or even sucky dell computers. A complete GOD of electronics (knows more than the entire set of courses here :P ),  loves taking risks, and always so confident about anything he does, be it about finishing off the syllabus flat out in one night before your exams, or even arriving from home on the day of tests 
and still making it, or even somehow convincing any prof to get a makeup any time he's missed something!. How I wish I had even a tenth of that confidence!. This guy has the ability to get things done, no matter what. A brilliant organizer, the way he went through the arrangements for that awesome Ugadi dinner shows real professionalism in his ways. That was truly a memorable event man! And, the one thing that does stand out is his GODlike driving skills (read: 400kms in about 12 hrs)... those awesome road trips down south are all thanks to him. Well, wishing you success in your future endeavours, and someday, you will find yourself taking-off in that Su-30 for sure! All the best! Do keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pavan-agnihotri">Pavan Agnihotri</a></p>
