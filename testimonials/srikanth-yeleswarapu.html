<h1 class="page-title">srikanth yeleswarapu</h1><p>An ardent Sachin fan, this guy would definitely be loved by any person(especially girls ;)). Its been around 3 years of our friendship. He is the person you look forward to in any kind of a situation and am glad i got to know him. We have been through a lot of stuff in the past 3 years and he is a person who will be remembered for the rest of my life . <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>One of the fellow CS players :D
First, if you don't play CS, there are a few things you need to know before you proceed further, go on, it won't take more than a minute..
1. CS is a shooting game. Primarily 3 maps:  dust2, nuke, inferno
2. You need money to buy guns. So save money if you are out of it.
3. I can buy a gun and give it to my teammate (called 'dropping a gun') :P
So we're good to go now.

The first time I really noticed this guy was when he saved money to drop a gun every round for me in nuke. Back then, and even now many know him as vinsik. First off, this guy plays CS like he is in an extreme hurry. Keeps rushing :P But at the same time, some times too many insane shots :P

So we've established that he's a good CS player :D
Other than that, he's nice at heart, and hates to code :P
Still owes me a treat for a particular favor in a Java Online ;)

Seems very silent when he is in the class, but goes on an absolute marathon in gtalk. I guess he has his way with girls. I mean, he IS something if Anushka chose to sit beside him and talk for, what, 20 mins ? Damn, dude, even the hero of that movie didn't get to talk to her :|

They say everyone is unique in their own way, I don't know about everyone, you sure are :)

So with this, I'm just telling you that you've been a very special friend and I wish you all the best for your future :D Ob you'll do well ;) I'm there for anything you'd need :D (except code submissions :-| )

All the best.

<p>This guy and me share almost the same life in college.our life is a two phase.one before 1st yr and one after 1st yr :D .we'd definetly say it that we miss those 1st yr wonderful days with all our batch mates :D.And coming to srikanth..... None'd ever know him as much as i do!! we have been together since +2,a long journey through with this menatally retarded guy in the sense he has this immense feeling nature be it love,care,affection,anger( :D ).He makes me feel needed when we hang out usually.One will obviously be surprised whether one can really be so close and affectionate in a short nap of time and assole i bet you are always next to me :D.We have been room mates,college mates,CS clan mates and alll.We share all the stuff except the fact that this nerd wont drink and neither he is a non-vegetarian which i hate the most in him.We share every part of our feelings.He is sincere,SENSITIVE,fun loving guy and always complain what he do not like in others ;).In fact to say he is a duo.one we normally see is one guy,one he actually is... is another guy!! :).In short to say he is diplomatic.I am defintely thankful to god for giving me this nerd friend without whom it'd have been a lot boring in my life.A very kind hearted and animal lover :D.One of my best frnds in my life.I can write bundles of pages about this guy if you tell me to!! I couldnt believe the fact that the life here in goa would come to an end this soon :( .Would definetly miss you but am happy that we wont be too apart all the rest of the life :).Thanks for everythng srik.... :) .                                                                                                                    ----Andy

<p>anthgee(in 1st year),vinsik(in 2nd year),jinger(in 3rd year)..one person..many (permanent) nicks-obviously,name do changes with person's change in INTEREST(if u know wat i mean)..every nick in it follows the same pattern..which shows his dedication towards each person is equally distributed..it shows his dedication towards the things he does(obviously not towards studies-which he is supposed to do).but, when comes to things that he is supposed to do-let it be studies, presentations, reports, projects-he could be the laziest guy i have known..he will do anything with dedication if he wants to do but noway he does it if he is not interested..i strongly think that there is another angle in srikanth which i still don't no-hope he will show it after reading this :P :D..he is a good family guy who deals with relationships very well..helping friends in making/breaking(:P) relationships including his own...starting with CS,our journey went through tests, night-outs, seminars, trips, list continues......i enjoyed a lot with you except the psycho part of ur nature :P...true manager...i see so many managerial skills in him...though his field is technical now,i am sure he ends up in being a managing guy(bakwaass---i know he is preparing for CAT) :D....who hates to code just like i does but tries to understand it as if its a fairy tale :P.. still i am not sure how our first meeting had happened..things do happen for a reason though,i am very happy in having a friend like u..i wish u all d best for ur CAT and further studies..i wish u will achieve and acquire watever u want in life.. urs

<p>A true gentleman--atleast thats the first impression u get on looking at him---but believe me he has this wonderfully wicked side---and i mean that in a good way---which only a few people know of and i am grateful to him for letting me be one of that tight group....He has this wonderful caring heart that always yearns to give and never even pauses to expect anything in return...A perfect geek and a sensational CS player(assuming u know what CS is :P) and a pro DOTA player too :D....Never saw anyone who love animals more.Still remember how his face used to light up when talking about his beloved hen Cuckoo(R.I.P) :(....A true feminist(not a tharki :X)...He is like this guy u look to when u need something and he always delivers on his promise.Can be a real pain in the ass sometimes but that doesnt stop anyone from liking u even more....The realization that all of this is gonna come to an end so soon is really making me sad and I wish time was slower...Btw an ardent fan of sachin and love stories and "feel" songs....Thanks for making the best 4 years of my life even better :)...Good luck man in everything and with everyone :D !..
P.S.-U still are my fool proof plan to make a crap load of money...

<p>A true friend who never feels bad about continues to be friendly to all people around him.A person who is always ready to help no matter what hour of day it is.He may show off as he is takes li8 but does thing that other might take double the time and what can i say about his dedication towards game... No matter what we have exams/assignments/test(which we anyway not attend) he has never said no to CS(Please don't ask what is CS,all i say is "14"). Well the mystery behind "Vinsik" might still be hidden :P but he is one of the coolest guy i have ever seen. Wish you a happy and prosperous future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>

<p>To start with srikanth is to start a day with laziness :P  He attracts people with his childish , family  ;) ,attitude . The best thing i find in him is patience and the way he mingles with people . Its been an awesome time along with him in PS. Cheers to Vijaya dairy too..  As you can see in all too  he is very talented gu(a)y in our batch !!  Some secrets not to share is he is always worried about gettin a 'lipo' :P . And the second thing with Vinsik comes is his CS . Its been years hearing from him promising not  to  play again .But you cant c hange his mind it is a fixed passion of his  .And he is the best player of people i watched people playing it. All i would tell at the end is my dear srikanth dont worry about the 3 kotlu your father gives in your future and all the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/satya-deepak">Satya deepak</a></p>
<p>He was one of the first guys i met on this campus....at the day of my 1st sem registration we met as our priority numbers were from the same group...from that day on he has been a very good friend of mine....the first year look with a handkerchief and a mobile.....always dedicated to the mobile......his usual answer when anyone asked him was arey i was talking to mom.....the second year comes to the phase of nocturnality during which i had to go to his room to seem and of course could see him at the cricket matches we played.... though initially from the same hostel later this idiot changed to AH-3....And he is so stubborn for small things.......and quite famous for ur status msgs on buzz and gtalk.....after every result of every test the same cliche "ee sari dunni rasta chudu" and after that "NO CS" and it all used to be the same......had much fun around....it would be much more fun if it was a little longer.....anyways we are from the bezawada......we will meet around.....dnt ever try to give hand when called out.....miss u....bharath

<p>Srikanth a.k.a Tommy . My dear brother :) . He is an epitome of kindness and a family kin of person(i simply luv d way u feel 4 ur family). He is childish at times, especially wen ne one gets angry on him he cools dem down wid his childish pranks :D. He is a perfect xample of laziness u cn say :P . Always tries to pull ma leg :P . The first luk of him will give u an impression of an xtreme introvert but once u get closer to him, extrovert wud be an apt word :D . Hez is huge music lover(u cn make out thru his gtlak status msgs :P ). Heard dat u r CS god(veetikem takkuvaledu :P) .Caring and a sweet person and has traits of psycoism and sadism :P. A trust worthy, entertaining, kind hearted person.Thnx for being such a wonderful bro n frn.

<p>Very rarely loses his temper and in those rare cases the victim is mostly rakesh :D :P.
Don't know much till ugadi but came to know a lot after ugadi  from rakesh and one of the most important thing I came to know was about your ruminating capacity :P. Very friendly and helped & guided me many times and I'm sure that you will even help me in next semester :P. _/\_ CS player as I came to know from my friend.One thing I could never understand is how could you manage with very less hours of sleep , really _/\_ (Exactly opposite to rakesh and of course even me).Good at managing things.Should learn a lot from you.No more words.All the very best for your future....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nunna-sathwik">Nunna Sathwik</a></p>
