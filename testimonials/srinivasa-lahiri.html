<h1 class="page-title">Srinivasa Lahiri</h1><p>Vampire... Lahiiiiriii, Srini.... hey... you forgot to add your nicknames.... the gem of his mom's eyes, and one caring brother.... that's Sriniwas (oops.. Srinivasa..).... Our meeting was one of its kind... we came to know each other because of one song... and I dunn how many songs and emotions we have exchanged... I guess that's enough to let anyone how far we have come together... Those imaginary creatures on your notebooks, craze for pizza and chocolates, vampire diaries and 24 fan,  those fickle-minded decisions, (kitna pakate ho yaar tum.... :P), long discussions outside library, our studying together for many subjects and then doubt-clearing sessions,... One pro person, who has tremendous potential to do anything, OS, EET, COA and JAVA god... _/\_... Quark Programmers INQ panel coordinator, Core member of Nirmaan... who managed it all and came out with flying colours... an awesome friend who really manages his life well... Your awesome song collection ( :P), getting irritated and a person who trusts anyone easily... you are very innocent... All the best for journey ahead... Just be what you are... be in touch.... take care... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sakshi-barnwal">Sakshi Barnwal</a></p>
<p>Srinivas is a  fellow vampire diaries fan and a very biggg foodie lyk me :P Surprisingly we have very common tastes, be it food, horror movies or tv series!!! Had a gr8 tym with you working for our event in Quark. We learned a lot together and got to know each other. A genius at acads, he has been the course topper of many subjects. A very sweet and funny person, he never makes you feel low when he is around. Remember the fun we had kayaking at Palolim? Wish to go to a few more trips lyk dat :) And yeah the trip we have been planning with Sudha and  Prashant since our Quark event never materialized :| Will miss you a lot yaar. All the best for your life ahead. Do keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sonali-bhadra">Sonali Bhadra</a></p>

<p>Lahiri..... the official IS Stud. Always has some armcandy with him :P He is one of the sweetest people I have met on campus. No inhibitions or preconcieved notions in his mind :) This guy is ever helpful, lending me mouse, heating pad etcetc at times of need. This guy has seen many a TV shows and still manages time to phodufy acads. His programming skills are exceptional (no wonder he was Panel Coordinator for Programming Events). My dear corridor-mate, he has been a source of constant TP, listening to his stories of IS and Guntur whenever im bored of my room  and inspite of living in my corridor, I see him more often outside the hostel than inside (In u know what I mean :P) All in all, a great fellow, sweet, caring, smart, goodlooking, any girl would be lucky to catch hold of him.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>

<p>lahiri...a guy with multiple talents,a true 24(tv show) fan and one of my best friends in the campus.we can't call him nerd b'cause he hardly studies but never dare to ask his CG.He is good observer,good speaker,quick learner,great artist(:P) and above all a good friend.He has some hidden talents-singing and drawing are noteworthy among them.He can make u laugh by drawing some stupid pictures(one day he drew a man riding a horse wearing helmet and skirt and he titled the picture-the great Shivaji. I can't stop laughing my ass off).I am sure you can't describe this man in one page.Will miss u a lot srinivas.ATB for ur future and  do stay in touch<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nadella-sriharsha">Nadella SriHarsha</a></p>
<p>Lahiri was my project partner and i am really thankful to him for his concrete ideas.He is a sincere,dedicated and determined person.Another "IS dood" lahiri is good i both acads as well as extra curricular activities.BTW never say i did nothing because doing nothing itself is doing various others thing.May you excel in your life.Farewell :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>Srinivas is a very sincere, hardworking, and at the same time a  really fun person to be around with. Very few people know that apart from getting great marks, he also makes good sketches about the mental state of a student in the damn boring classes. (the guy tied in chains, remember :P ). He could also be mischievous at times, as we both used to be sitting on the back bench of the class. He is very helpful, is there when you need him, be it a doubt in syllabus or a doubt in the entire topic itself. With such a big heart and such great qualities, I am sure he would do great in life. All the Best. Spent a great time with you. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-bajpai">Vibhor Bajpai</a></p>
<p>Lahiri... One of the best persons i have met on the campus.Very friendly person and he always has a smile on his face.The best part about him is his expressions which are amazing and breathtaking.Always tries to inspire and smile the people around him and also very caring about people aroud him.His talents include drawing amazing pictures :P during the class which induces a smile on the people who look at them.... In a boring class you are the first person i prefer to be along with to have a good time pass. I'll nevre forget the classes which we spent together especially CN and OPTI and ofcourse OS :D. I think you were the only one who gave me a lot of nick names on campus i don't even remember all the nicks you gave me :( . I'll always remember the days i spent with you on the campus and also the trips trips we went together :D. The best part of you is your smile so always Keep Smiling. I wish you all the very best in your future and stay in touch(We have one more semester on campus :D ). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ponnathota-tejeswara-reddy">Ponnathota Tejeswara Reddy</a></p>
<p>Lorryy babbyy !!! My beessstttt buddy on campus, one of the very few ppl with whom my ideologies match and among those ppl whom I can never forget. He is unique and a heck of a person, a magnet I can say, the kind of a guy who just does not have enemies. Fun loving, adventurous, caring, handsome, sportive at all times and really really smart AND not to forget, all time ladies favourite ;) !!  I just have no words to describe exactly the kind of person u r, baby, u r simply incredible.  
If u r with him, u r assured to have a wonderful time. All the things we have done together starting from the Minapi trip and then the Calangut/Baga trip, can say that it was one of the best beach trips, WE started playing in the Baga beach and when we walked of we were in Calangut the water sports and all, it was heck of a day !! Whenever we see water, just can't resist to go dive into it, that's among many things we have in common. In fact, we have always been there in our most memorable trips, Doodsagar and hey Dandeli  !!! The farm house, awesome food(non-veg was awesome :P) camp fire, sleeping in tents, Night treck, Rappeling, RAFTING(the most memorable of all) the natural Jacuzzi and all the remaining stuff. The jaundice break, sudden bus journey, I guess that was our first proper interaction, 1st, the idea of travelling in bus, that too in those laal dabba busses in addition to those horrible roads was totally freaky, but then, it was as if we reached home in no time( of course u 'd to travel twice my journey tough :P) all thanx to u, just dint realise how time went by it was almost 14hrs long ! From then on, all the fun we had on campus, children's park, killing time together, and our interest in movies match too(EXCEPT SAW, i just dont know how u can see it :P) ! And a fiction fan, especially those related to Vampires !!! Another great fan of Vampire Diaries(BOO to those who think VD is for girl's !! ). The interest in cartoons too. There are soo many things in my mind about all we did in past three years that i just dont know which to write and there just aint gonna be an end to this testimonial. A fan of coding and good at organising things, i clearly remembering being with ur event in quark, OMG, when the event was going on, it was as if u were an entirely different person, it was as if some big shot guy was running things around, u sure have the talent to get things going. U still owe me the treat man( >.<), u said ll u will give it for the event and just can't include it in ur b'day treat, I just won't buy that ! U rememb wen me u n sakshi had gone to Madgaon and the walk 4m Chikalium while coming back, it was \m/, remember Sakshi's face as we were getting late ? :D :D luckily we got a lift ! Like I said, I can go oon and ooon and oooon about all that we 've done together. May in be petty talks and hey, remember all the endless conversations we had about "girls" and some issues we had on same grounds but at different level(I'm sure u understand wat i am talking abt :P). Every moment spent with u was memorable and never boring. U have grown a loootttt since 1st year. Ur attitude towards various situations has in fact inspired me at times. Our journey together in BITS was awesome, u r among those ppl i will really miss big time ! May it be fun or any situation of need, u have been there. It's been heck of a ride. Love u loads. <3  :-* :)

<p>Lahiri! One of the amazing lot I came to know through Nirmaan. I shouldn't have said "One of" though, for his uniqueness.

Spontaneous, tactical, fun, frank, dedication, leader, efficient! All those expressions you make will never be forgotten :D. Your idea on last days of waves - SHG stall was something that mesmerized me, seriously! Your presence energizes the place! Feels weird that you are going to stay only for another semester. But the good thing is that we are from the same place! :D Guntur \m/ :D I know that you will have an amazing future! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chandrahas-muvvala">Chandrahas Muvvala</a></p>
<p>Lahiri!! Even though our interaction has reduced nowadays but I still can't forget the times we spent during our 1st and 2nd years. You were one of my first friends that I made on campus and I can't forget the countless times you have helped me to overcome any situation. You are great guy, genuine, frank, polite, innocent, awesome programmer, good leader and a very good friend. You are the only person in this campus I know who always keeps smiling(always keep smiling). Your charm, attitude and dedication will surely fetch you success in your life. I'll always remember the times we spent in our first year and i'll miss those night outs, combined studies(although i used to just sleep), sharing experiences and pulling deepak's leg. Anyway what I want to say is those moments are special and I'll miss you, keep in touch and i'm really sorry I couldn't make it to ur thread ceremony :) . All the best. Cheers!! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>

<p>Lahiri! I got to know him towards the end of my second year, through Nirmaan. He is a very genuine person, who comes up with out of the box, yet simple ideas which makes you think "why didn't I think of that before". A fun loving, jovial person, with a knack at coming up with stories (" Vijayendra Varma" was definitely a twist) and is good at keeping the entire group entertained. Very dedicated and sincere to whatever he does, he finishes his responsibilities efficiently. A guy with all the leadership qualities.. The way how he managed Prerna team has been an inspiration to me. His IS jokes and vampire stories are another story to tell :) Wish you All the Best Lahiri. I am sure you'll reach great heights :D.
