<h1 class="page-title">Sriram Iyer</h1><p>Sriram, an awesome guy with a great sense of humor. He is the only guy i've seen who flaunts about being dumped by someone. One could talk to him endlessly about girls, football and Eminem. He is a pretty good rapper and a decent bathroom singer. He was pretty good in academics till the time EnI happened. Since then we are great pals n share same belief towards our respectful teachers and Branch.
I wish you success in all your future endeavors. Best of Luck !!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>I first met him in 2nd year but soon became one of my best friends in the campus. We both share interest in WWE. It is always interesting to have discussion with him on it.  It is always fun to have him around. After dinner sessions I had with him at Mongi will be remembered forever. One can write a best selling novel on his "living habits". He is very honest & a good guy from heart. I wish him all the best in future... Be in touch...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Sriram....what can i say about this god-lyk personality. The most carefee banda in Eni(or mayb da whole campus). He carries a lot of positive energy with him... He'z one of the most content person i have ever seen. u'll never find him in a messed up position(not for long atleast)..he alwayz has a way out. This guy is totally immune to tension...and is perfectly capable of finishing the sem's portion of a subj by starting 1 nite b4 compre.Very intelligent..he just never yet got a chance to show his potential in engg(or so i believe) but i no this guy is gonna make it big.I find his ideals about life very similar to bill gates(yes dats true!) n i can nly imagine him at some top boss lyk position in future. The best rapper by far, his taste in music is great... I owe half da gud songs i hav heard of eminem to him. This guy really knows how to live life...takes it as it comes n enjoys it !... I wish u all da best for ur bhel puri business plans...i no u'll make it big! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/niharika-tiwari-">Niharika Tiwari </a></p>
<p>Sriram's famous for his "kattas". His endless pursuits with the opposite sex, with often disastrous results, has been a great source of entertainment. But his continuous efforts have finally given some results ;) Jokes apart though, Sriram's a really great guy. Always fun to hangout with him. Exams se pehle achanak jaagta hai, jugaad karta hai. Fir so jaata hai. Ya katte karwaata hai. Best of luck for your future endeavors. And keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Sriram Iyer, a cool minded person and one of the most spirited guys i have met. He is always fun to hang out with. Besides he has an awful lot of anecdotes to tell you, listening to which one is left to wonder how could all the tragedies happen to one guy. We all want you to know your room is a mess like your love life and your jokes are perverted. Nevertheless there is a charm in your chaos and we all love you for the way you are. Always stay in touch and wish you atb for your future...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-gupta">Sahil Gupta</a></p>
<p>The first thing that came to my mind while writing about him is his " tharak "...i wish i could someday get into his mind and get to know all his thoughts ( in all positions ;)  ) .. The best thing is, he's proud of it. Can do almost anything for money :D ... tried and tested in cmess :P . Biggest fan of Eminem on the planet (respect /\). Worst misfit for his branch and surprisingly became its coordinator
He's a big time foodie. his appetite for rubbish is commendable. has got the shabbiest room in the campus...i wonder where he sleeps... 

we've been buddies since the starting and i like hanging around with him. the best thing is you can talk about anything to him. i have hardly seen him in tension  ...he's really funny at times (with all his cheap shots :D ). Only a few people know that he secretly watches old romantic hindi movies... He's very optimistic , be it girls or his cgpa :D (raat me 12 baje start ..subha 8 baje khatam ...compre done :P ). 
you've an amazing personality man..keep it up.. 

wish you luck for future :)

<p>A Cool,Carefree guy who doesn't care a fig about other people's opinions about him.An avid Junk foodie,you can never feel bored while talking to him.His sometimes unique and funny perspective on things can never fail to entertain you.The best compliment i can give him is that no moment is dull around him.He will always entertain you and bring a smile to your face even in your darkest of moods.He is never tense regarding anything and always tries to see the best in every situation.He is the only one I have seen who can pull all nighters with absolute ease.Its been fun living next to him for 3 years and I wish him the very best in his life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/praveen-shreenivas-addagatla">Praveen Shreenivas Addagatla</a></p>
<p>Sriram Iyer.... SLIM SHADY.. or as we address him.... is one of the coolest guys around... and  who'd always be there to discuss about every1's girl's issues... though his might have surely been the biggest in the BITS's history.. :D But carefree and fun loving guy.... and i respect him for that.... Hope he achieves great heights and still keeps on rapping his way forward... :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankit-jain">Ankit Jain</a></p>

<p>One of the most brilliant guys I have ever met...The only guy I guess who can crack sad self depreciating jokes about himself and still be cool with it.. Our taste in everything is the same( except the eminem part).. Probably we are kumbh ke mele mein bichre hue bhai and shit..The only reason I pull your leg is because I know you wont mind....Another quality I admire in people.. But another thing to mention is your cheapness.. The only thing I think which may prevent you from getting laid..I hope you never change man and be yourself all your life.. True respect _/\_

<p>Most of my friend circle has two categories of people, first being normal and second being sriram iyer! If words like weird and bizarre ever decide to personify themselves they know whom to find :P The sheer honesty that this guy possesses is incredible. The ability to crack  excruciating and  humiliating jokes on your own self is a quality which a very few people are blessed with and this guy falls in that basket :) I wish I could be as honest as you some day! But the outer image of ridiculousness that he portrays is so very different from what he is deep inside! Deep down (and by deep down i mean deep down in your heart and not somewhere else :P) he is a guy who is soft hearted, humble and one who can't express his emotional side so easily ( or at times expresses it way too much, so much so that he  expresses it twice to the same person :P ) and at times HE IS EVEN WILLING TO LEND MONEY :P  (contrary to general public opinion) 
One person whom i'd miss the most hanging out with is you. We together had some awesome moments. We were the ones who discovered the WOW spot. We had a 6 month 6 pack pact (which failed to materialze :P) We embarked upon the "MISSION PROM" together and We had those end less discussions in night canteen, mongi and nescafe  which used to eventually boil down to girls! 
I know i haven't said this out loud ever to you but i honestly feel one day your gonna make big! (Again, to clear the context,i'm talking abt your career and not otherwise :P) Dunno where that will be probably one day you would be running an international chat chain, probably an Indian rapping academy or probably you will end up being a top class professor who has a Phd. in Microelectronics!!!! But yes u'll make it happen! be the same, be weird, be crazy, be disgusting and ridiculous the way you are coz thats why your frnds love you :) All the best!!!!!!     <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-kawley">Ishan Kawley</a></p>
<p>We are destined to do this forever… You sonovabitch… Stole my line… But then this usually happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. ;-)… Usually when writing a testimonial, i write it late in the night, with some random me songs playing as the background score. But at the moment i am listening to G.O.A.T by MnM and just finished watching Cartmanland(again)..  You get the point right? Why do you love being with Sriram Iyer? Its the sheer originality that catches your eye from the very first moment. There are somethings which go amiss about Sriram, cause many just don't understand the Honesty(yup thats the word) with which he carries himself. There are so many things to enumerate… The experiences we had, the Micro Zero state(remember) {btw… Gets a zero when he says so and a 75 otherwise} and then the game plan we made to ace Compre.. Got Av+.. Bitch please people :D… The endless arguments that we used to have and those exaggerated anecdotes… Those countless hours at Monji.. You still marvel me with your ability to make fun of yourself… A unique sense of humor.. Your close ones really do like that "sriram" sense humor.. Man should see his room… Absolute garbage.. You know that quote, A cluttered desk represents a cluttered mind.. Total nonsense.. He thinks really clearly.. Man, I so love that confident face of yours and that look on your face, the moment when you are about to crack a joke on yourself or those countless :bhelpuri:  moments. I think i will have to quote Einstein "Any complicated fool can make things look bigger, more complex and more violent, but it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." . ( Only for you: Okay, it is tough for me, but i have to confess this. This day has made it all clear to me, you are better than me Sriram, you are the best. Got it an? )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
