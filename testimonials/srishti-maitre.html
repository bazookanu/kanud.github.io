<p>The cutest and most innocent person I know. She is so cute that it gets irritating at times :P. Can make you feel like you are talking to a 4-year old, She is a die-hard romantic. Watching her reactions when she is finished with watching those mushy videos is truly priceless. Is a Foodie to the core. She is one very pampered kid( wouldn't ever accept that). I mean, she expected us to shell out five times the money to go on an AC bus to PS. A big big miser, expecting treats from her after she gets a 8-P gpa or even if its her B'day is being over-optimistic :P. Very fun loving, cheerful, humble and helpful, it has been a pleasure knowing you and thanks for making PS so so much bearable. All the best for your future, penguin :P.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Cute, extremely cute at that. The first time we interacted was, ahem, to say the least, not something which would have warranted further interactions.. :P .. But then again, trolling on DC doesnt really count... :D, and thankfully it didnt.. 
It has been an amazing 2 years (is it?) since then.. Loong road trips, arambol hill tops, palolems, amboli, and what-not. And then Panaji for food. The food angle HAS to be there. She is a food-ict, a big one at that. Right from the cheese-bursty Dominoes, to Mangii, to Sher-e-Punjab et al, her taste-buds satiate at naught. Good food implies good time, and trust me, each of those times have been as good. After the nite-outs, I can vouch for the amazing fun person she is. :) Hopefully we will have many more of these to come in 4-2.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhaavan-merchant">Bhaavan Merchant</a></p>
<p>As innocent as, As sweet as,As funloving as,As chubby as and As ....as (you can fill  as Many adjectives) Srishti. She just defines utmost care for her loved ones,an extent and a level which is unparalleled.As for me she is my mumma,who never disappoints whether is its the random plans or the awesome treats, the outrageous road-trips.A complete foody,love her taste for food (We often end  up sharing the best of non-veg dishes and she gives me the complete liberty to order) and also at times accompanying the Mongi boy to his fav place . Shopping times with her-Remember getting gifts for shreyans or buying pullovers for me, we had our fun part.And at times when this foolish boy is upset with life,she just ensures the smile is back on the face.I have never come across someone in this fast paced world,who has such a crystal clear,I mean there can be only Srishti-given her gentleness, Dont worry , I will back with my poor PJs bringing the grin tour face :P in 4-2 and have loads of masti.Its not the end rather the beginning of the our journey of friendship.Best of luck, keep smiling as it reason for us to smile :)   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-raj">Amit Raj</a></p>
