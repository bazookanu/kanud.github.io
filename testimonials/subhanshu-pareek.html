<p>A Fun-Loving and Enthusiastic person who excels in everything he puts his mind to be it studies,oratory,dancing etc.An extremely talented and gifted individual,his incessant cracking of jokes(mostly pj's) always brings a smile to your lips and a lightness to your heart.The Dude of the Chemical branch,he always spreads cheer wherever he goes.His talents in dancing are extremely well honed and he is a perfect example of an all-rounder in an Engg college.Hats off to the one and only pikaachu™!!He will surely scale great heights and my wishes go with him so that he may even exceed our expectations. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/praveen-shreenivas-addagatla">Praveen Shreenivas Addagatla</a></p>
<p>Aur Subaansu .... :D That's my trademark way of calling him ..... :) I always used to wonder why everyone loves to trouble him so much.  But when I started it last sem, I realised it's so much fun !!!!!!!! He is the youngest among our group and is fondly called Bachcha. He has been my wingie for the past 6 sems and we have spent infinite moments together, be it solving each other’s Numal doubts, learning the Rubik's cube, playing bowling on Pandey's tab, the various trips (especially the Vagator one :P) and many more. He is very sharp, cool-minded, caring and has a heart of gold (jyaada emotional toh nahi ho gaya naa ?? :P). Even by not attending classes, he manages to phodufy his CDC’s. He is one guy whom everyone should have as a friend and trust me, you won't regret. It's our last sem together and I wish you all the best, my friend, for your future endeavours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>

<p>Subhanshu..we call him baccha... abe 16 yrs ki age me college kon aata hai be :P ... he's one of the best friends i have in campus ... First time i met him on the reg day in his room itself...had formal intro n stuff ... never knew ki saala har jagah sath aa jayega  (copyright , ye mera dialogue hai :P). Be
cpc ( remember " kaa bhaa?? ") , all other classes ,vadodara, projects , everywhere .
He's the cutie pie of our group, the reason why we call him baccha...very intelligent ( bas kabhi kabhi chamakta nahi hai bechre ko :D ), full of life, a great dancer , awesome volleyball player, humorous, big fan of wwe. 
Sometimes tries to act "khool" knowing he'll never become one :D .  , ????? :P  , caring and understanding (no one knows  me better than him ) 
i loved playing pranks on him esp. pushing dadu's apparels through the pane :D and also teasing him with chocolate wrappers :P  We've spent lots of time together,  from gay dance at dj nights to eating gauri bhen ki meethi daal in PS  :D , from our boy talks at nikunj's room ( sadly arriving at the same conclusion everytime :( ) to listening "brown rang" hours before pdd exam , nesci, monji , sometimes lib :P , teasing him for his inability to understand physics (reason y u fell upside down in ajwa :P :D ),
 from our group studies in cpc :D  to waking up early for ffo ( bas 15 min aur sone de and shit :P ) , bhand evenings at bogmalo,  ( ****** monji ?? :D) , sleeping in dadu's room (all 3 on one bed :P ) , had many trips together, not to forget, the trip of life ( Dadu gm :P ). 
All this while, i never realised these 3 yrs will rush so fast .
You are the person whom i know the most in the campus. You've been a brother to me and always will be .
All the very best for future and ob we'll stay in touch .. :)

<p>Cute, lovable, awesome- These would just be some underweighted adjectives for him. He brings life everywhere and anywhere. Be it a dull afternoon or those DJ nites- One heck of a dancer he is ! Those moves :-* :P
Youngest among us, everyone is very fond of him! 
Will always remember that 3am campus walk, you, me, rastogi, akash, sriram, dadu and your horror stories from Rajasthan!
Phodufies any course whatsoever. That lovely smile, that cute face :)
Will miss you and keep in touch :)

<p>Okay stop crying Milind.. Stop crying.. Cant help it.. How does one define Subhanshu Pareek.. The person who is always happy. Who loves his life and the way he his and his world. A person with immense self respect(he himself might be unawares of this fact) and pride. Why does everyone love him so much without him even trying? You know, there is something about Pikachu. I cannot imagine my college life without you. If i start writing about how i feel about and all.. It would take a day or something for me… I don't want to.. All this is encapsulated within the fact. That I love you so much.  I will miss you, your smile, your charisma, the way you dance, your "ever lasting happiness" state, your childish innocence and matured nature. I will miss yelling "pika pika" everyday and coming to your room and harassing you with all sorts of ways. Its like, we have been here to be happy, to life our life and get the best out of it. Thats how we were meant to be. But we lose this spirit as we grow up. I lose it at times. But you know it very easy for me to get that spirit back. You know how i do it?? I look at you. And world seems to be a nice world. Worth living and loving. I am not in a state to write anything more. I love you Pika. And i will miss you...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>I don't know how you were named Pikachu, but it feels good when we call you by that name! :D The dude of chemical branch! You phodufy all your sems; have been a 9p always! (Well, 1st year li8 le lia hoga tune :P) You helped in in acads whenever I asked for it. A true child at heart, you have always won over people by your jolly nature. We met in an Amit Setia's class as far as I remember. (ya, we even went to his classes back then!) The rest is history ;) Those 25-people beach trips :D and dinner parties; scooty road trips \m/; the trips to vasco for quark(li8 only) and of late, the ecstatic bogmalo and utorda trips would be deeply missed! How could I ever forget Jog Falls trip, remember that night, when we were deciding which car to sit in after dinner? :P <br><br>
Yaar tujhe photo khichane ka bohot shok hai :D Well, you are photogenic :) Your dancing skills could have landed you in DC and you would be with someone else instead of reading this testimonial now :P (Kata hai be tera! :D) <br><br>
Oh mere true chemical engineer, I'm sure you will soar to the greatest heights in any field you go to. All the best. Will miss you. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yachit-mahajan">Yachit Mahajan</a></p>
<p>What to say about this guy!! Totally chilled out and always fun to hang out with.  EPS classes  were the best memories I had with him. With his cute face he is pretty famous among the opposite sex ;) A very good speaker and a pro writer!  Wish you all the best for all your endeavours.....keep rocking \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Bacha, Pika are some names we call him by... i don't exactly remember when we first me but it was surely the first few days on campus and its been 3 years of fun filled college life with him since then... Our friendship strengthened as mine, his and Vishal's capabilities in Physics were exposed as we were the worst in our entire group... Still remember the group trips we had and the random bogmallo outings since last 2 semesters... enjoyed a lot with you... can't imagine how life would have been on campus without your smiling face and occasional saste jokes... those evenings at mongi with you and Milind will be remembered forever... Having fun and mocking Vishal in his room during his sleep time was fun... teasing Nikunj with you and pandey was awesome... those early morning breakfasts in first year, the POM presentation preparation in my room and Rastogi getting beaten up all the time was amazing, will cherish these moments for a long long time... A lot has been said about your Chemical Pro-ness.. A 9p for 2 consecutive sems... (make it 3 :) )... dhokha de diya tune PS mein... still will enjoy with you in Waves (hopefully)... 
Wishing you all the very best for the future and may our friendship always grow stronger!! Stay in touch!. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>
