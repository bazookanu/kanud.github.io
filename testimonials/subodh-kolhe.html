title: Subodh Kolhe

<h1 class="page-title">Subodh Kolhe</h1><p>Start-ups, entrepreneurship, MBA , TED, Quark, Waves, Politics, chudaap, li8, #$%^@...If these were the clues in Jeopardy I'd win a fortune by guessing Subodh Kolhe. He is not the most loved guy on campus but he has been the most entertaining one for sure. His skills are beyond measure and his capability to be unique is something I admire. 1-2 was fun for me with this lunatic but then he got too busy as usual. I hope he carves a niche out for himself wherever he goes. Enjoy and party hard,just the way you do :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Left studies the moment he stepped in. Dunno how many Es he's got. Has had a hand in every college activity since then. He feels a bit weird now that he is not involved in any tedx or waves or whatever. Still tries hard to be involved. Has been involved in big screw-ups and hence, has made a lot of not-friends from friends. Anyways Politics not my area, so I'll stop here. Yet he tries a lot to be  innovative. When he's not doing some college event bullshit he'll keep browsing the net searching for that one idea. From what I know that idea hasn't come yet. But best of luck kolhe. Who knows :) And return my fukking 4k :|  And a big thanks to auntyji for the big parcels she sends that fends of our hunger on days we don't visit the nc. But yeah his chudaap have been a piece of laughter for the whole hostel. Keep doing chudaap, but see that it doesn't screw-up something :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mayank-singh">Mayank Singh</a></p>
<p>He must be having stuff stocked under his pillow as he is always high. Never afraid of doing anything new or revolting. He is the entrepreneur in true sense. I will be indebted to you for making me trust my chudaap side, convincing me that something good can actually come out of it. I know you wouldn't ask God for a successful life but for an interesting one, so here it is, may God bless you with the most interesting life, may you always entertain people around you as you always have. Cheers, best of luck ;)

<p>Is an asset to any firm enterprise he starts or joins as he just knows how to get things done. By hook or crook, by jugaad or chudaap, he will do it.  Is desperate to start up, let the idea go the dogs, he just wants to start up. A trustworthy guy. And a real source of inspiration to his juniors.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>A guy who will always have something to say in any topic you take. Although sometimes taking things a bit too far , hes all in all a person with whom you can never get bored with. Will always be indebted for teaching me many things. Always a source of inspiration for doing nonsensical stuff :D . The best part about him is that he is very trustworthy and very trusting. Often his tendency to trust people easily has landed him in trouble sooner or later.    But he always moves on without cribbing about it. Have a blast ahead and cheers !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nishant-shyamal-budhdev">Nishant Shyamal Budhdev</a></p>
<p>Kolhe is a man of ideas! Sometimes even too much for his head to handle and that's when he lets go of things in a big way! :P 
Politics and startups are his two eyes and orgnanized chudaap is his third eye! He defines organized chudaap like no one else on campus and only those who closely follow his actions understand what he's upto! His networking ability is simply legendary and virtually nothing can beat the shit out of him. Every time he goes under, he rises up again like a phoenix from the ashes! Name any organization on campus and snap, Kolhe's contact's there to get his job done! Kolhe marries an idea quite easily, but in its defense he faces too much and often gives it so much that he ends up messing with his priorities. So to say, he meditates in his cocoon of an idea! 
Once in a while he realizes that he has a personal life too and that is when he speaks his heart out! Never holds a foul intention or grudge against anyone, though people misinterpret him sometimes.
All the best with your 'ideas'....... just make sure you stick to one sometime and work on it diligently! :P
Will miss all the chudaap you do! ;)

<p>It's that one line I read somewhere that instantly reminds me of him. "I'm CEO bitch! Just need a startup idea." Always searching for that elusive startup idea that can change everything. He's a pretty motivated guy, a good networker, and almost always high. Jab dekho Velinos ya Utorda mein pada hoga. Ya koi fest mein, ya elections mein. It's been fun with you man, and hope you do well in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Kohle, lets leave about the brilliant ideas and the work you do for some time!! you are a great guy dude, never seen some one so down to earth and so friendly like you. I had a great time with you always and we still got another more year!! Hoping for some much better time :P All the very best !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>You're one hell of an interesting guy. Always trying to do something or the other, the whole time. I am pretty much sure that you've tried out nearly everything that you could have in your 3 years of college life so far. I remember that you could ping me when you get some idea to work on. And then you would say that you're in mood of some *chudaap*. Haha. It's good to know you. All the best.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-pant">Aniket Pant</a></p>
<p>2-2 it was...people were giving intros in some lame elective class...a guys stands up and says "hi i m subodh kolhe.."...OK so now let me give you a brief description of who "THE Subodh Kolhe" was to me..a imaginery guy from
AH4(never knew how he looked),all i knew was "kolhe ne ye chudaap kiya".."kolhe ne wo comment mara".."kolhe says JAI MAHARASTRA :P"...etc etc...so i turned back and finally saw how Subodh Kolhe looked like...a tall lean guy hardly able to stand  :P..just opposite to the image i had that of a Maratha.. (:P lol)...
the next thing i know is tat we hav the same PS center...and it is there tat we talked for the first time...and wat i understand of him is..no matter how much chudaap he does...a gr8 guy..who hates studies,hates msc maths big time :P ..
loves politics,android freak,a lazy ass but loves whatever he does,has two modes-completely obsessed or li8...and now referring to booze and stuff...during PS once i asked- 
"Hey Dude, Why are your Eyes so red...? You look High..."

"Nah," he replied, "Just my allergies."

"What are you allergic to..?"
i asked, Unknowingly...

"Pot."he says.. :P...never seen such a bindass banda...dude have a great life ahead...best of luck... :)

<p>Subodh Kolhe .......popularly known as "coco kolhe" in first year .....he was one person who used to leave my blood boiling in those days ...........as we used to always have a difference of interests ...:P!!!We two have fought one of the most famed "cold war" of this campus .......but....today ..he is a person who will be one of my support systems next sem when I am devoid of my regular friends...:D!!!!!I have no significant memories or incidents to share with you ...because frankly we have none...but I am sure next sem we will have the time of our life ........:D!!!!!!He has amazing entrepreneurial skills and I think he will do something big in the same .....:)!!!! All the best buddy for your future and life .....:)!!!!We still have a lot to do together next sem...:D!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-choudhury">Rahul Choudhury</a></p>
<p>The first time I heard about Subodh Kolhe was when we firsties asked Sarthak the meaning of 'Jugaad' in the TEDx orientation session. Sarthak told us to ask him. I even saved his number that day as Kolhe Jugaad. Since then he has been one of my most inspirational seniors. Not particularly in the CGPA perspective, but working with him during Waves was a different experience altogether. His attitude was by itself enigmatic. One moment he'd shrug and say his characteristic "Li8", the next he'd be coming heavily upon us juniors for not scheduling and starting the events on time. After Waves also, he remained a person whom I can always turn to for ideas, whenever I am blank. He must be probably the only senior who, instead of telling me to increase my 5 point GPA, told me to actually maintain and not let it drop further :) This sem, people may have said things about him, but I still believe in him unconditionally, just the way he believed in me. As this year goes by, I just have one regret that I got only a year to spend with this totally crazy and wonderful person.   May God make everyone of your 'jugaadu' ideas come to life bhaiya. Good Luck! 
P.S. I know at the end of this post my sad full name will appear, but I hope you always remember me by 'Susu' :D

<p>If success was a lock, I am pretty sure Subodh Kolhe would be grinning at a distance with a bunch of keys, all opening that lock. From all his tweets about various ideas for start-ups and ideas in general,  I could make out only one thing- he wouldn't settle for anything but the best and he would do it the hard way if it had to be done the hard way, but he will get it done. If he would find a way to execute an idea in a particular way, he wouldn't stop at that, he would try to find a better way to execute it, something that would require less efforts, less time, less resources and so people would crown him, " The Most Jugaadu Banda On The Campus" but what they don't see is his brilliance and hard work. Never the one to just sit around and give orders when it comes to leadership, he would involve himself, be a part of the team, work as much as any other member, accept responsibilities, accept mistakes( if he ever committed them at all), and keep aside everything else for the betterment of Waves. He would lead by example and people used to follow. “Yesterday’s home runs don’t win today’s games." was what he seems to have unknowingly made me realize when we met the first time for my induction into Waves Controls, when he took my interview and I will always remember it. It was really a pleasure working under his leadership and this is also a saddening fact that I could only work for a year with him and learn from him. I hope he achieves whatever he aspires and wishes for and wish him great success in his path. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ateendra-sharma">Ateendra Sharma</a></p>
<p>COCO Kolhe!!!That troubled soul down the corridor who is waiting for that one big idea.Politics,event management,start ups,entrepreneurship he has done it all and is a master of all trades but when it comes to studies...ahem ahem lets not discuss that cause you can't judge this guy based on acads.A chudaap loving and totally bindaas guy his company is always fun to have and you can never get bored with his talks :P :D.A very politically and socially aware person he knows a lot about current situations in the country and that is quite appreciable because of the general trend of taking such things li8.I owe him a lot of food if it were not for him in the 1st year i would have died of starvation.I will always remember the discussion we had on the night of xx april (i don't remember the date X-) ),it spanned a total 5 hours and still lot needs to be answered.But i got to know a lot of things that day thanks to Kolhe the man!! i wish him good luck for that one big break.All the best man :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>kolhe!!!We first met in my 2-1 but i have got to know a lot about him in this short duration.. one of the few seniors i can trust blindly :)...campus ka sabse bada jugadu :P..... a guy who is always in mood for some chudaap... campus ke sabse bade neta and full of random(and some times good too :P) ideas..... this guy has tried almost everything 1 can in the span of three year and still wants to do more...  gets very senti specially when high :P  
he has always been a mentor(thus the source of all my chudaaps :P) and like an elder brother to me... always supportive and keeps on giving ideas to help me whatever i am doing...   thanks for being on my side all this time..i owe you a big time.. :)
may you succeed in whatever chudaap you are planning to do in future :P  all the best for your life.. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-taneja">Nikhil Taneja</a></p>
<p>Subodh Kolhe , CoCo Kolhe (Is that Fb page still der? :P), kolhe and more popularly known as chutya!! This guy he most of the times has very little idea of what he is doing and ends up doing last minute stuff and that is why he is very good at jugaad. Our friendship sparked from day one on campus when i got to know him and gelling became easier due to no language barrier. He is jack of all trades but a master of few and that has lead him to organizing various thing is campus. He was one of the very few people who made the initial contacts with our senior batches esp. 2007 batch (2007 batch - /\ ), and was very active in every election for CSA till date (and for it has gotten into some trouble as well). People see him as guy overworking his brains to come up with strategies during elections, but very few have seen his true side. I can proudly say today that I feel like he is my brother, and I know he feels the same. One piece of advice my dear bro - continue life like now, don't worry about what your peers think about you also know there are some changes that you need to bring about in your behaviorism.  And also remember that there are more and better things to life than booze and weed. More on this later, for now All the Best and FTW!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shreyas-habbu">Shreyas Habbu</a></p>
<p>There are very few seniors who treat their juniors as peers, as equals rather than someone to be ragged and made to run errands for them. The first person that comes to my mind when I think of such seniors is Subodh. I heard a lot about him before actually meeting him. Words like jugaadu, politician, chutiya walked hand in hand with his name. But what I had for him, from the very first time I met him, was pure respect. He was my coordinator in waves controls and not even once was I, being a fresher, intimidated by him. He has this amazing gift to make people feel comfortable around him. Never shying away from accepting responsibility, he is one who will lead by example. I still remember those nights when we met in the night canteen. He would be hanging out with his friends, but still he would come and talk to me and help me if I have a problem. I mean these little things like finding out how we are, giving advice when we need it actually matter a lot to us. I’m sure he will achieve whatever he wants to achieve and become very successful. Bhaiyya, I hope you remember me after passing out because I for sure will never forget you given how much you helped me. Thank you for everything and Good Luck for the future.
P.S. Tera treat abhi tak baaki hai :P

<p>Kolhe!!! Probably one of the most creative and innovative guys I've met in my life! His brain is ALWAYS working out-of-the-box, and he's always cooking up some random idea in his mind. A highly observant person and an EXTREMELY quick-thinker, he has the ability to fool almost any person into believing anything he wants them to, even if for a while. He has managed to build an amazing social and professional network since the day he's stepped into college and is always looking for new opportunities. One of the few people on campus whom I can always trust and fall back on, life would've been much more fun had we known each other earlier. It was only in the second year that we first interacted and life's been one hell of a ride with him since then. Together, we've seen all kinds of highs and lows and joys and worries and just endlessly planning and discussing crap has been immensely enjoyable. It's always fun to take his case whenever he makes a stupid statement, when he tries to convey something but is unable to get it through properly, and times when he speaks, writes or thinks in English. He speaks a completely different language, that of ideas, passion and innovation and despite the linguistic gaps, I feel great to listen to each of his ideas. Kolhe, no matter what everyone says, stay the same crazy-idea-guy you are and don't ever change the way you look at things because of what anyone says or does. There is a lack of people like you in the world, and I'm sure that with just a tiny bit of extra effort and enthusiasm, you'll make the dent on the world that's yours to make. I hope we get to spend much more time together and do more of what you like to call "chudaap". And I do hope that you start a company of your own very soon, and that I get to be a co-founder. :P To finish, I just want you to know that no matter how much I contradict you and take your case on those ideas of yours, it's all meant as good fun and over 90% of them are seriously stuff that we need to think about! Not many people understand you at most times, but only those who do know what a gem of a person you are. Stay close to those people and never change because each one of us would consider it a personal loss if you did. This isn't goodbye, especially since we've a lot more random stuff to do in the next year and the years to come! Signing off, Cheers! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>
<p>Subodh Kolhe! The name is a brand in itself. Let's  say it is a Iconic Brand. In the one year I have known you, you have taught me innumerable things. Whatever I have learnt coming here, major chunk is of what you tutored me. 
You are a guy with the weirdest of the Ideas one can ever come up with. They may or may not work. But they are what define you. Define you as a person , as a phenomena.
A person whom I can trust blindly.
You are a source of constant inspiration and motivation for juniors like me. You have showed the righteous and positive side of Chudaap.

<p>Kolhe! You can love him, you can hate him, but the one thing that you can’t do, is ignore him. I got to know you properly over the last year or so, and it’s affirmed my belief in the previous line of this testimonial :P I still remember election day at bogmalo last sem(well, the party at John’s later ;) )And ofcourse, those night outs during last sem end, and during Indiafest, even though I didn’t get to see much of Indiafest. Here’s to another fun filled year! Cheers :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chaitanya-bhatt">Chaitanya Bhatt</a></p>
<p>I met Kolhe for the first time in the mess. One look at this guy that time made me think what a straightforward he might be. Short hair and a small mustache grown . But talk to him for 10 minutes and you will realize there something much more into him. A very ambitious guy since the beginning itself. He made many of his claims come true over the last three years. He is the first of my few friends on campus. Starting with the Chintawar for gensec campaign I came to know more about this guy. He is a born leader and a great manager. I also remember those days of 2 - 1 very well when we used to stay the night up for exams and did everything possible instead of studying! From watching Bigg Boss to trailers of new movies, taking turns in sleeping, gossiping and what not. You can never get bored in the company of Subodh Kolhe ever! I again got to work with him for Waves 2011 which rocked because of this guy :D. One last thing I would like to mention is that if you ever become friends with this guy be sure that you will be friends forever! Keep in touch mate (although we are sharing the same corridor next sem).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vaibhav-barthwal">Vaibhav Barthwal</a></p>
<p>Kolhe, you'd know him as the guy who was behind every frickin' dept and fest back in first year and a part of second year. Surprising how he manages to figure in almost all controversial incidents on campus. Given that, you'd think that he's an asshole (maybe a bit? :P), but he's actually really fun to hang around with, moreover he seems to be perennially drunk, so that helps increasing the fun quotient. 
He's got information on everything that goes on campus, and whenever I need to catch up, he's the guy to talk to. He's also very helpful and very very desperate to start up :P (got more ideas that I need to debunk? :P)
Hanging around during TEDx was great fun, looking forward to another semester on campus!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rounak-jain">Rounak Jain</a></p>
<p>Kolhe! Ok this is really late, apologies for the delay but here goes..... Firstly, you are different! :P Start-up start-up start-up!!! I can't wait to see the start-up you'll finally come up with :D I'm sure everyone is waiting for that :P Selfish or whatever, i'm very happy you were there in math :P warna i guess Es pakka lag jaate :D That dry Majorda trip sure was fun :P Though you chickened out running across the tracks :D Cheese and Wine :-~~~~~~ Angaara was another experience, only a few of you witnessed "it" ;) (I'm sure you understood what i'm hinting at) Tere S2 pe thode aur apps daal de :-/ We have EnI now, let's hope it goes better than maths :P ATB for your startup! I'm sure this isn't goodbye! Cheers :D

<p>2 things to come to mind when I think of Kolhe..... Start-ups & Jugaad.... He is known to be the most Jugaadi person on campus... Its surprising how much he knows about entrepreneurship especially seeing his active participation and regular twitter updates about some or the other articles on Startups.... Really, though I haven't interacted with you much , but I swear for however small time period I have come to know , I really feel you are great human being, and you have come a long with Pragya.... She is my best friend and I don't think anyone can make her happier as much as you do.... So stay together... Stay in touch and Cheers to life....... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arnav-goel">Arnav Goel</a></p>
<p>Kolhe. The Chudaap House of Campus. The first time i met him, was in fact to go to a senior when Yeola got his first session of ragging. The worst thing when you talk to Kolhe is that there is no use. If he is speaking, there is a 5% chance he is not lying. Also when Kolhe provides some piece of information it is very totally useless, because it cannot be used anywhere without the prefix "Kolhe says". Lately he has gone mad about Startups and Entrepreneurship. I really hope you become that entrepreneur you dream of becoming. N yeah Kolhe, the person who encouraged me the most towards alcoholism (futile though :P). For the most part of my 1-1, We shared AH4- 323. It was a lot of fun working with him for Waves. Very ambitious and a great Manager. I am sure you'll make it big some day. One of the few people on campus whom I can always trust and fall back on. English, Hindi or Marathi, I don't have a clue how all can be equally good (I'm the glass half full kinda guy :P) at the same time. Also hang on to Pragya. You probably won't find anyone else.:P This testimonial will be incomplete without a mention of Campus Politics and your involvement in ALL of them. From the Chintawar, Reddy or Habbu, Kolhe has always been the mad jugaadu go to guy, for any election related shit. Don't change. Stay Kolhe Stay Foolish. I'm glad i got to know you. Things here would have been much different without you. Please don't make my life miserable next year. I'm equally excited and terrified by thought of it. All the best for your life ahead.
