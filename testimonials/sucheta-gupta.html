<p>I got to know her better during my PS-1. She is diligent,helpful, humble and soft spoken. She loves her work & completes it with full dedication.  Thank you very much for post PS-1 tr8 :D. PS-1 was really a memorable experience(you know y?).  I wish you all the best for your future... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jinal-shah">Jinal Shah</a></p>
<p>Hey dear, I won’t write about what a good mélange editor you make, how much you fretted over all the details for getting it right or about your hard work to make the workshops during waves a success; I wont write about those times because you weren’t around and you weren’t with me while you were working  :( . No, I’m just kidding :P . You were always around all these three years, you mothered us both, Khyali and me when we didn’t take care of ourselves. The way you took care of me when I fell ill; I almost didn’t miss Maa then.
 The best part is your amazing walking style, the jump in your every step makes my heart stop :P . I cannot help flirting with you, Suchi baby (my darling ‘chokri’) :P . You know well enough how I envy your petite figure considering your eating habits, wish I could eat so much and still remain thin. 
I respect you a lot for how much you love your family and friends. Your sister is lucky to have you to look up to, I’ve never seen someone being a better elder sister as you are to Juhi. I, for one, am not a good elder sister. We are here, hopefully together for another year and many more, so don’t be happy, I’m not yet saying goodbye or asking you to always remember me because I will try to be around to bug you for as long as possible. :D

<p>Sucheta, one of the most hardworking girls i have ever seen. We became friends while working at DoCW. Blooming with creativity, she possesses excellent leadership abilities (DoCW again). She is a fun loving girl (DoCW trip :D ). Oh yeah ... She is excellent in academics also. Forever ready to lend her notes, she helps others with a smile. Also, she is the only one who dares to crack jokes and laughs at the profs... thus inviting their glares sometimes. Motion sickness is her only weakness i guess. Hope she overcomes that :D . I wish her good luck so that she can achieve what she desires. :D   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>So where should I begin???  Its difficult to even think of a day when I wake up to find OMG!! “Sucheta doesn’t live in the room next to me anymore.” In all the five years of my life I have spent with you.. you have been a lot of things to me.. the companion from home when I came all alone here, I have never felt alone.. :) . I wonder if I would have even be in BITS if you weren’t my benchmate in school!! :) She is one person I can endlessly talk to and the night would end without realizing how long we have talked.. There have been days when I just stood outside your room talking to you continuously for hours standing because we would think that the conversation would end in a minute, but before that there was a new topic to discuss. My subjects have been fun because I sat besides you in class and you would always find a doubt to discuss! In all these years…you have been everything to me from being a sister to a mother.. you have moulded the way I think, made me the person I am right now… taught me to read newspaper :P . We have bugged each other long enough but I don’t mind a PS2 again with you… If I begin to talk about our PS1…this testimonial is never going to end… She has taught me to cook food too.. :) I would remember your watermelons… Thankyou for all the moments when I came to you and cried about my sad life and then you would cry wid me about both of our sad lives and finally we would discover that afterall !! life is not so sad.. :) We ll be alright with each other.. and I confess that I actually missed you after PS2.. when we went back home.. that was the only tym we remained apart in last two years!!! How wonderful it is to know that I can still jhelofy you!!!…. Thankyou for thinking for me when my brain was shut down… Thankyou for making me see things that I couldn’t without you… You would always remain in my heart.. now don’t be senti !! Smile :) I LOVE YOU my  CHHOKRI.. :)       (This is the shortest I could make it!!)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/khayali-jain">Khayali Jain</a></p>
<p>Sucheta!! ...She is very helpful and caring. She never forgets to ensure that I reach home safely.A hardworking person who is excels at academics and is a dedicated DoCW member. You will always find her in a jolly mood, no matter what the situation is….loved ones call her “chhokri”.. She stays pretty calm before exams, a very rare quality. I should really learn this from you. I don’t know how she manages to get confirmed ac train tickets for everytime! She is saviour!.... Will always cherish the memories of those train journeys which always started with a long wait for the train, your dialogue “ train aa jaye bas, jake sona h” ( :P) , movies and tv series we watched together, and how you never took out playing cards when you had them in your bag! I will miss everything. Wishing you all the best for your future endeavors! Hope we meet again..stay in touch!
P.S : beware! I am not going to let you sleep this time during the train journey!

<p>suchetaa!!..(or chokri :P ) Kind, caring , helpful, fun-loving  girl, Sucheta is an avid reader, loves listening to music and works very sincerely for the DOCW (lab mein poore time phone pe hoti thi iske liye! )She has the most impeccable timing especially when it comes to scarying u during a horror movie and has never failed to do so when we are watching one. My eni fellowmate n my deco lab partner! made the hectic wednesday deco labs a lot more fun than making boring circuits whose outputs we hardly got. She likes to live life her own way, and at her own speed and in her own peaceful and dreamy way. She can sleep anytime, anywhere n for however long.. (one had to keep checking on her during tssn n transd n the boring likes incase she fell off to sleep) I haven’t ever seen her get tensed for anything.. be it acads, mélange, waves workshops, getting late for her train.. anything..  Its been fun having u around in the bacher n numal classes.. stay the same .. all the best for ur future.. n stay in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/disha-pramod-gujar">Disha Pramod Gujar</a></p>
