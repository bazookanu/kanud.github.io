<h1 class="page-title">Sudeep Gupta</h1><p>One of the first friends in the true sense of the word that I made in Goa. Forever ready to help, I will always remember him for his humility and his unique style of speaking that just evokes hilarity. He is truly a very warm person who knows how to share and reciprocate feelings and emotions. Happened to learn quite a lot from him. Hope he reaches great heights in the future and may I remain friends with the quintessential "Sud"forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>

<p>Sudd, as popularly referred to, is one of the most talented and genuine person I've met. The time spent during PS1 with you is simply memorable. Playing CS with you is treat(really I mean it!!). His unique accent makes his comments really hilarious. Finally, if you can't get along with him, then probably u can't get along with anyone in the world.... Love your genuinity and simplicity..!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>

<p>Sudeep ...you are an incredible person and i love the way you speak the way you imitate others and the way you even swear. I'll miss your 'enthusiastic reviews' about the movies and songs you liked and also i'll miss your way describing incidents!! What more can say ? If anybody ask's me later : who were your best friends in BITS ? I'll surely mention your name :) We might have met late but i certainly don't regret a single moment spent with be it the combined studies for bio or assignments etc.I think ur the most active person on gtalk and i know any time if ask you a favor u'll never hesitate but do it :) Keep up your attitude and you'll be very successful in your life. I'll miss you man but only after the one more year we'll spend together as neighbors :) Cheers!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikhil-mandalika">Nikhil Mandalika</a></p>
<p>Sudeep aka Sudd aka The Stud! (I won't write the other name your corridor mates gave given you :P)  We first met during our PS-1  in Tehri (a memorable experience) . Though we hardly had any work there  , the upside was that I got to know such an incredible person.  Easily one of my closest and most cherished friends on campus,  Sudeep is always an ocean of calm. I've never seen him loose his cool and he has this amazing ability to both laugh at  others as well as himself . We share a common love for movies and music (he was the "dj" during PS-1,his laptop always playing the latest songs :) )  . An ace badminton player  and great athlete overall, he's also quite the ladies man :D.   His helping nature, unique cursing  style, and his hilarious arguments with pandu are some of my  best college memories. I wish him all the very best and hope that we stay in touch throughout  :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayush-sanyal">Ayush Sanyal</a></p>

<p>Sudeep was one of my first friends in the campus. We have spent so many unforgettable moments together, all of them cannot be mentioned. But I wud like to  remember our mumbai adventure (or rather mis-adventure), along with guru ji, that was real fun. God knows how many times we have missed our trains from Delhi station. I can't forget the way he gets ready to go newhere for a trip with an esctatic " CHALO!!". The way he does it is one of its kind. He is a hard working guy, and I am sure he will be successful in whatever field he chooses to go. I wish him all the best for his future. Farewell buddy!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>

<p>Lives next to next to me, and its been three years now. Apart from his random, nope, continuous rona-dhona with regards to the tests( both before and after) and this and that, a simple, friendly person with a great sense in mathematics. Spends a stupendous amount of time in searching for new, old, and ajeeb songs. And of course, watching movies. No idea, how he can watch so many movies. The group studies we have had have been epic(especially remember that sound clip last sem?) no wonder you did make Bio bearable :) And come to think of it, I realize we have never been out together, not counting the bio trips :O We'll probably have a trip next sem. 
A nice imitator, funny, constantly itching, and a horrible coffee maker. We have had some great times together, and hope so that will have it in the future too :)
Aur i hope you do what YOU "REALLY" want to do. All the Best :)
There are sooo many things which I can say, but I'll probably stop, and you know why.
You have been a real support, even with all tha kamina-panti :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshit-somani">Harshit Somani</a></p>
<p>We know Bio people... how cool they are :D Sudeep is collest among them.You need to see a good movie or a tv series no one can suggest better than him.Somehow his and mine choices on such aspects matched a lot.We all(suddep,me,guru,ayush,pavan and pandu) had a great time be it while having lunch/dinner or the chats on the bench :P He always has some spicy news to share with us.Leaving the funny part aside he is a hard working student.As exams approach he gears up and then you know..... in one word he is "phodu" .It was indeed a gr8 time with u.Have a gr8 life ahead.Farewell :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-thakur">Aniket Thakur</a></p>
<p>Sudeep is best company one can have. One can feel very comfortable when he is around. Always had something common to talk with him. I am gonna miss our window conversations and my song requests.(we have opposite window across hostels).I will always cherish all the "chalo and fatty conversations" that we had and many more to come.(From now on in C mess :D). AND our movie suggestions to each other (Agent-47 \m/). We both have same taste in music and movies "aakhir ek hee gaon se hai hum". All the labs and all the bio trips that we had(atleast one more to come) were fun. Next sem will be awesome with both in same hostel, looking forward to it. Best of luck for future plans (mostly we will be knowing each others plan) aur agar kuch nahi hua toh "gaon jaa kar mehnat karenge.......... :P :D"<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>
<p>My first class-mate in bits...we had the same classes during 1-1,....an academic phodu by nature,i guess me and the other guys(guru,gaurav et al) cant thank him enough for meticulously taking care of all our train journeys to and fro....thanks man!,one of my very best friends on campus....he is your ultimate all rounder,a pro badminton player,his sometime incorrigible voice on the phone(call him for mess on the phone....sudeep:"aarah") provides for ample comic relief for all of us...my most cherished memory will be the innumerable train journeys to delhi and back (sometimes on an RAC ticket)and most importantly our pre-t1 doubt clearing sessions in panda's chamber....lol :D we were noobs back then weren't we??all the best sudeep and please stay in touch!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-ramanan">Paritosh Ramanan</a></p>
<p>On the first day when i talked to him, i was sure that he would be my best buddy.That day and today, he is mine best :).Actually the good thing about him is that u can talk to him about anything and everything. Honest, fun loving and helpful r the words that defines him.He has lots of stories to share and laugh at. Manages very well between his studies and sports (he is a pro badminton player). All the train journeys and especially the one during jaundice break are the memories which we will remember for the entire life. I was lucky to have you as my best friend. Wherever u go whatever u do, my best wishes are with u. May you attain the greatest heights and all the success.best of Luck!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aakash-srivastava">AAKASH SRIVASTAVA</a></p>
<p>“Aur launde!!” ,This is how our conversation starts. Sudeep is a person whom I find is helpful, truthful ,original and fun to work along with. Takes lot of tension when it comes  to writing reports :P . sab movie achi lagti hai isse.  Has good sense of humour .it was fun to have him in same lab group ( although he seemed busy somewhr else ;P ). All the best for future ( waise abhi 1 saal ka saath hai ,EEE  :-|)

P.S Next sem toh pakka jog karne chalna hai!! :P

<p>Sudeep is by far one of the nicest people I know. Very very helpful, humble and down to earth and extremely hardworking and sincere. The kind of kid parents dream of. He takes simplicity to a all new level. Though we've never hung out much despite living a couple of rooms apart, whenever we have, it has been fun. He is a natural athlete, a brilliant badminton player and a very enthusiastic futsal player. Takes all the fun poked at him very sportingly. All the best for future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Agent Sudeep is one of the simplest guy i have ever met . He is very  humble, innocent and simple person who is always ready to  help . He can be easily manipulated this can be inferred from all the parties that we have taken from him for no reason .  He is really good badminton player and athlete . He is very decent and a true friend that one could ever ask for. I wish you all the best of luck in your future endeavours and this is not a goodbye, only “hasta luego” or “see you later”.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tushar-mandar">Tushar Mandar</a></p>
<p>Sudeep Gupta! One of my closest friends in campus and one of the simplest and the most humble people I've ever come across. I've have shared innumerable good moments with this guy and I shall cherish them all my life. Ill miss going to his room for no reason, talking about randon movies and songs, all the gossip :P, going for our famous chakkars, our exam time conversations on how doomed are we,water breaaks, NC for coffee and of course all the crazy ass pranks that we have played on people. A very dedicated fellow, he is meticulous in his work and gives in more than 100% in order to achieve his goal. He will certainly go a long long way in his life. I wish you all the best for your future. God bless. Cheers! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/hemant-bhatt">Hemant Bhatt</a></p>
