<p>i am thankfull to ntn asahay and alwayz will be for introducing u to me that day in d first sem while walking after the dinner......., and since then, yeh silsila of unlimited fun and laughter aisa shuru hua jo aaj tak rukne ka naam nhi leta. :), 3yrs sala 3 din ki tarah nikall gaye par aaj bhi kisi nonsense bat par hmlog ghantoo haste rah sakte hai.
i still have not forget all those countless moments when we (u, me, pandit,pawan,keej,paaji,shashi,Nawaz,bhaiji,govi, and entire group) used to hang out either in the groundfloor APNA CORRIDOR or in your room no. 222 and often humara Chudaaap kuch aisa shuru hota tha ki i remember many times i have to leave the room coz of stomach ache and loosing out my breathe due to continuous laughter ,. really this is one thing i will be mising a lot during the next semester..... , fir uske baad toh.....:) all back yeah!
room no. 222 will alwaysz be there reminding us the glorious time that we spent togeather, may it be making fun of each other, or mimicing ( in which u dont have any match) and  making fun of others (( which i enjoyed a lot, remember MJ in swapnil's room after election, chaalle hmlog 2 mahine cheee yaha gaand mala rhe hai, and we laughed our asses out in his xterme serious and angry speech., or gym instructor-“aii kya ree? Aise karte hai”and dafenately many more.)), our joke evolving theory and taking it to a new level (in both direction ) with each passing day..,, And yes not to forget our "TOP TEN CH*^****ya CHART" that we created very early in the 1st or 2nd sem i guess.((( i think we need to refresh the list , li'l changes expected, however. AJ will still be on the top , wont he?? u remember the tough fight b/w aj and shubhankar :D ))), ahhh all those moments cant be expressed in words .......
i must tell you that u r a tremendous guy with possibly the exact correct kind of attitude towards life., and i have learnt a lot, a lot from you.
i know that sudeep that not many one knows, and that guy is extremely hard working and has the confidence to win it all on his own. many wont believe it now (those who see cgpa and academics in the collg to measure it) but i m sure this diamond is going to sparkle the brightest in the world out there..
also u r alwayz awarded the title of most kamina member of the group ( which u r , u may deny it ) for which I would like to say  ki " JO Dost Kamine nhi hote , woh kamine dost nhi hote" and u dafenately are a Great Dost to me and evryone and i feel " extremely lucky " having u as a friend. Alwayz keep in touch.
I know u will achieve all that u aspire and wish u best for the future.
-you friend always.
