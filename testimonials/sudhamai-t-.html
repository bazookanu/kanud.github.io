<h1 class="page-title">sudhamai T </h1><p>Sudha is one of the best girls I have ever met here at BITS.A true friend,she will always be by your side when you need her.She is fun loving and carefree at times.She is clear about her goals and ambitions and works hard towards attaining them.We share a mutual high regard for values,good manners and hygiene(:P).Above all she has a very pure mind and doesn't hold anything against anyone which is why I believe she is a blessed soul. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>The first word that comes to my mind when i think abt sudha is determination.Believe me I hv never ever seen any girl who is so much ambitious and determined(KASI!! in our lang :D).I often feel sad for she not being in IS so that i cud hv copied all d assignments from her :P . She never gives up any thing . A person who loves challenges and has got an amazing perspective towards life. She is the person wid whom i can share nething n everything.Fun luving, consistent, safe player, confident, knowledgeable , admirable (ok i ll stop here.. i can't search for adjectives ne more! :D :P )
                        I luv d way u treat ur frns .. miss u loads.. hope we ll continue d same in d future.muahhh - yours MLK :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/laasya">Laasya</a></p>
<p>Sudha / chocky ... Lovingly called as Dhummu !! ..( Dhummu is a dust that rises when a hero steps in ... Heroic nick after all  ) .. Dhummu has soooo much determination after all .. She never gives up once she sets her eye on target ( Okkasari commit ayithe naa maata nene vinanu type ). She has mountain sized perseverance and dedication :D .... True scholar in my entire friends cirlce.. Yet she is so innocent and cute when it comes to friends. You'll be surprised at how stern look she can put up when a situation demands.. Like being in an election commission  . She is most adaptive. I'm sure you'll be greatly successful in Life .. and dhummu lepu !!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Sudhaaaaa...i always remember her as the course topper of one of mane's courses (its like a distant star to all of us :) )..We always feel something missing if shez not around us. It were her jokes that I enjoyed the most. Sudha never likes to see a person sad whatever the reason might be. She tries to cheer them up. She never wastes even a single minute in the class :P ;) (by sleeping in d cls if shez not interested :D )  She is fun-loving, hard-working, dedicated, talented, caring....(dis wud go on...)  I would never forget the time spent with you.. <3 u ''baby''.. wud miss u nd ur jokes alot.. :(  Wish u all d success in ur life... Hoping to see "S&S" soon... :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/karnati-chethana-reddy">Karnati Chethana Reddy</a></p>

<p>well!! Sudha is one of the most dedicated, hardworking and jolly persons i have met in my life. She is the one with whom i used to hang out in the early days of campus and actually forget missing my home. She is patient and has a good presence of mind. People can actually learn from her how to maintain their cool in creepy situations!! ;P. By looking at her and the things which she does you can actually say that GREAT THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES!! :) She is extremely fun loving, cheerful in her appearance and behavior, helpful and caring. It has really been a great pleasure to have spent these few years of my life around her.
