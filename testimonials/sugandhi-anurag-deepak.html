<p>An ardent TV-series watcher and a passionate politico-economic news keeper are just the few characteristics to start with. He is a very simple guy and greatly knowledgeable. He lends his helping hand to almost anyone in need. We share great deal of thoughts upon matters of money and finance and the future. These discussions would effortlessly permeate into our dinner outings at “shahi durbar”. I love and cherish those intellectual debates with you. He is highly opinionated on matters of defense and warfare. He doesn’t care much about what people think about him and remains as he is. We love chocolates too! I would never forget myself getting into his room and cocking up a reason to extract a custom handmade chocolate out of him! I sincerely wish you get whatever you have wished for, in your life. I shall never forget the memories that we’ve shared. I wish the best for you. Cheers, mate! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-kapoor">Anubhav Kapoor</a></p>
