<h1 class="page-title">Suhas Suraj</h1><p>modest, simple and wise describe him best! though he tends to go overboard with his storehouse of knowledge (pompous :D) but it best gets overshadowed by his concern for the society and the environment. 
one advice : dude, chill! ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritish-garg">PRITISH GARG</a></p>
<p>One of the few soft-spoken guys I've met in BITS. I first met you in Bio Project Lab elective. You extremely modest, simple and i guess very concerned to society. He has been a very active participant in Abhigyan. Also he is among those few guys who are able to withstand the Tsunami called EEE..
Best of luck for your future, Have a great life ahead !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>Suhas is one of the phodus of EEE, easy going with everyone and smart. He has helped me a lot academically. Very calm and cool by nature, perfect gentleman i would say. you were with me in Com-Sys lab. He knows almost everything. Wish you all the very best for bright future ahead. :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-sharma">Akash Sharma</a></p>
<p>disciplined, meticulous are th first few words that come to my mind when I think about Suhas. He was the person who first got me thinking about saving energy and environment and similar stuff. When you want some help in acads, he will make it a point that you learn the topic( though it may appear strange at first , at the end you realize that he always meant the best for you). Over the years he has opened up tremendously as a person. I have tremendous respect for him for the zeal and fervor with with he teaches kids in the ábhigyan group. Besides having amazing technical knowledge( not only about acads but also pkanes and guns) he also appreciates music. He is one friend who will tell you his opnion to your face, You can always depend on suhas for something for once he commits to something he always does it. Have had some great times with you, all the best for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>

<p>There are not many people to whom I 

can spam links about sleepy Air 

Canada pilots without the fear of 

getting de-rostered from their gtalk 

lists :D Suhas is precisely one of 

those people with whom I can chat 

about any sort of nonsense. The sheer 

amount of links and news articles we 

have exchanged online is mind-

boggling. Always one of the best guys 

to have a long winded semi-

intellectual discussion with (which 

eventually taper off to random 

nonsense), knowing him has given me a 

much wider view of the world in 

general. Extremely honest, sincere, 

dedicated and simple, he is a gem of 

a person. Cannot forget to mention 

that he's incredibly intelligent and 

superbly talented and an electronics 

geek, usually found to be playing 

around with his PSoC kit in his 

'spare time'. Has a delightful sense 

of humour, which is a pleasure to tap 

into at times. Yeah, I regret not 

knowing him earlier as well, I dunno 

how we never met before that! He has been an amazing friend over this one year that I have known him. Will cherish the short time that we have known each other nonetheless :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>Suhas is very simple, modest, intelligent & a hard-working guy. Spends most of his time either studying or chatting about some electronics stuff. He has his huge bank of knowledge in every field which will definitely take him to great heights in future. A very practical person. Yeah, he is very much passionate about planes (knows about every damn plane existing). He is currently my LOP partner & he only does most of the job :P . All the very best for your future Suhas !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>Well, where do I begin...?? This one's going to be long... :D My friendship with Suhas dates back to those good old Bangalore days where we spent a brief time together in our coaching classes. I was truly amazed when kind fate landed both of us in the same campus (which I guess neither had ever imagined) and I have thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful journey ever since. Our relationship knows no bounds and is way beyond the scope of mere words and testimonials. Those amazing times we have spent (right from the day-one of college) and those numerous discussions we have had will always be etched deep in my memories. Its interesting to note that more often that not, our discussions on varied subjects of common interests ranging from tech stuff, aircraft, religion, politics, wildlife to even petty ones like ink pens (!!) have always ended in fights :D, with neither of us ready to accept each other's opinions :D :D. Even in the midst of these skirmishes, its surprising to see how we grew to be inseparable parts of each other's lives. Perhaps, that's what they call "Friendship". I sure will miss those fights :P. He is one of the most informative, opinionated, sincere, straight-forward friends I've ever had. His unique ability to stand by a point and defend his stance by aggressive arguments is highly adorable, one which everyone only wished they had. When it comes to attending classes and taking down notes, he is the pinnacle of sincerity in this campus, that I can say for sure (maintaining flawless attendance records in courses like Consys(!!) is no small feat). Although there is an elite crowd which manages this feat, this guy distinguishes himself from the crowd by being intelligent too. He is one guy whom I have never seen denying plans for outings, however tough, unplanned, impractical or ambitious it may seem (including our latest Margao adventure :D). His meticulousness in handling things (which I witnessed while we organized Ugadi dinner) and quick problem solving skills have always inspired me. I also must appreciate his love for music (which, many people are unaware of). I could go on, but in no mood to make this any longer for general good. It is needless to say that you have been and continue to be a very special part of my life. Wish you a great future and a contented life ahead..! Farewell and keep in touch (I know you will ;-) )..! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>Hey! .. Man,too much coming to my head at the same time.Cant recall clearly how we met,but then thats buried beneath so many good memories.. =P .. He is the one person who shares my passion for electronics(and is able to understand my jokes =P),among a suprising variety of other topics(!)..Shared some fun evenings tinkering with electronics with him,whatever be the excuse.He won all the real technical events at Quark'12(_/\_),and that kinda tells you know he isnt just another EEE guy.Not even close(LoL).Something I really admire in him is his enviable command over his technical interests,and at the same time..his hardwork and dedication to pursue something beyond what most do or even care about.He has put lots of work into Abhigyaan,because thats what he wanted to;and that is something that I sincerely salute.Cool or "uncool",he will stand by his core beliefs like a real man should.Level headed and smart,he is really great company,even if he isnt the guy who gets drunk each weekend at bogmalo or is famous for legendary lan gaming or whatever.. One of my closest friends,he has influenced me for the better in so many ways,in countless situations over these three short years.His wisdom toward life,success and the future is something that leaves me amazed each time I'm fortunate enough to receive it.His honest,organized,down-to-earth nature and calm spirit is unshaken by circumstances,be it good marks,bad marks or girls or any damn thing life throws his way(which something I need to imbibe from him!)...Had many panjim/vasco trips with him,sometimes for cheese,hard-disks,suits or just tp and those rides to panjim for passports! That was one mini-adventure I really enjoyed sharing with him,and each time I look at my passport,those memories bring a smile to my face.

Through My tough times,mental times,2am--thoughts-on-origin-of-life-and-the-future times,you been there and supported me,accepted my flaws and helped me overcome them.I hope this amazing journey I had with you doesnt end,and that the world sees in you what I have admired and strived to inculcate in myself(=P) over these years.. Stay Strong,for life is gonna go supersonic for you very soon,the way I see it.All the very best for greatness!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
<p>On the first day of BITS … was looking around everywhere in campus for kannadigas … N I was  happy to hear someone talking in kannada finally that turned out to be Suhas in the SBI. Did not get to interact much in first year … It was only after the first kannada trip that I got to know him well and came to know him better coz of travelling together. Bio … aeronautics… EEE …. animals(i remember the snake pics :P) … omg … he knows a lot bot these … I was startled by his knowledge in the long talking sessions in the train.  A very dedicated part of abhigyan from the first year. It would be impossible to make “ugadi dinner “ a great success without his and a few other’s efforts. Thanx to you that we finally had something special for the kannadigas  on campus :) . Suhas is an extremely down to earth person .. friendly … and very helpful … It was grat having you as a friend … Do stay in touch … All the best … :)
