<p>Founder of Chu Club and Captain of Cricket Team Sujat Jain shows exceptional leadership qualities. His ultimate networking and curiosity has made him a pro gossiper. His typical way of speaking has set a trend in the entire hostel, and we people also have started calling people "chu". Apart from Chu Club activities, he has also given me expert advice on many important issues. He is hardworking and intelligent and may get anything he sets his mind to. All the best !!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paritosh-gote">Paritosh Gote</a></p>
<p>okey SUJAT one more attempt lets see how this one goes...When all of us enter college and we start making friends there are some special ones and at once you realize that they are the ones who will be there  for the times to come and you are one of them my dear friend.. first of all some mandatory work.. excellent cricketer, level headed, Chinki, positive attitude .. blah blah blah... and now the real deal.. you are emotionally the most sound person in our group.. never saw an emotional outbreak of yours in these three years( except for few incidents at BOGMALO , those doesn't count here). All of you people consider me the leader of our group but i personally think that its bcoz of you that we all are still together and going strong considering the level and the extent of chudaap we do.. this maturity also comes coz of your age :D ..  leaving that topic aside..  and as i accept it now.. i always cherished each and every moment you guys spent in my room .. cant really call them moments it was an era considering the time you were there in my room... Will surely miss your ( aurat like chudaap )..and there is NO  DEAL between us..  wish you very best in your life.... hope you stay the same.. CHINKI  we love...

<p>He is the snr citizen of our grp and with that the most experienced one too. He is the gossiping king ( of course ladki waali harkat hai but queen nahi likh sakta ) and has the ability to twist and turn any sentence ( by others ) for his advantage. Can instantly spit fire btwn 2 person and can also pour water on it. Being in same branch we helped each other a lot and am truly amazed by his question guessing ( kota effect maybe ). We call him tharki but let me be frank he never came close to being a real tharki. A great personality and equally good sportsman, he is one of the popular guy of our batch. Although he didn’t gave the party he promised me a yr back by citing diff reasons every time I ask for it , he has been a great frnd and awesome branch companion. I wish him a great and successful career ahead…….. oye baal ke bare mein toh likhna hi bhool gaya ( dude going bald pretty soon ) neways have a rocking life ahead!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-garg">MOHIT GARG</a></p>
<p>SUJAT BAKLIWAL(tharki) let me start by saying that u are one of those guys that a person gets the privilege to meet only once in a lifetime. n thank god i got that 3 years ago. wen i first saw u in the common room i instantly felt that we wil be the best of friends. u were cunning, smart, fun luving n just the kinda guy i make friends with. although u hav disappointed me in one thing.. i believed ki tu ek gf to banayega due the kinda knowledge u hav abt them. nevertheless i hav to say one thing just try to accept a few thing n dont always ignore them (if u noe wat i mean). i will miss the chudaap tat we did in bangalore , goa on new year's eve, in rohit's room, the fact that u wud come n say "chudaap time!!" :P n that nite at bogmalo wen u cried n made me cry as well n the count goes on.. i will always remember all the advice that u gave me wic made me a better person.. i may hav never told u bt i seriously want the level of maturity tat u hav.. u wil go a long long way, mark my words.. just be the way u r.. n for god sake's stop worrying abt ur hair.. thakla ho ja plz.. n please accept the fact that u do luk like a chinki.. n plz stop acting like an auraat :D
i noe u wil hav a great life ahead.. n u will live it in king's style.. just dont forget me.. I WILL MISS U :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shubhankar">Shubhankar</a></p>
<p>Sujat jain aka 'tharki' aka 'AURAT' is the gossiper of our group.. beware of what u say in front of him bcoz he can present it to others by adding a lot of 'mirch masala'.. But, amongst all the gossip, he still has the sense of maturity ( senior citizen jo hai :P).. you are the only guy in the group who has less hair than me, always trying to hide the bald spot when wind blows.. i will always remember the endless discussions of our 'chudaap time'.. it was a splendid time of 3 years we spent together and i hope we get to spend more time in future.. oh, almost forgot about your cricket (he was the captain of BITS cricket team).. you have great passion for the sport, i mean i have never seen another guy crying for the sport he plays.. what more to say, anything i write will be less.. have a great future.. it was great to have done so much 'chudaap' with you!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/jain-himanshu-hemant">JAIN HIMANSHU HEMANT</a></p>

<p>Sujat ! Could'nt ask for a better neighbor. Whenever his room is open, I would drop by and have a little chat ! Lives to the fullest ! Its cricket, parties and poker but during exams, he is a complete different person (sort of like multiple personality :P) , he owns the library and does it such a dedication I often wonder how ! Respect to the  "Exam time Sujat :D" ! And the proud proprietor of Chu club ! I used to brag to my friends back home that my neighbor is from Guwahati :D ! A selfless guy with great accent ! I have enjoyed all the corridor talks we have had ! I wish we could have spent more time together ! Good luck for all your future endeavors ! Stay in touch .

You're an amazing person. Always there to help me both on and off the field. I think the whole captaincy role has tremendously helped you. 
Always ready to do chudaap. You're real fun to hang out with.

<p>if you believe the words "never go by a person's face" --- u're probably wrong! sujat is as "tharki" and "harami"  as he seems to be :P :D hes got a really gud sense of humour and he'll make a joke practically out of nothing.our college's cricket team 'kaptaan' is also the founder of one of the most coveted clubs in our campus.. the *** club :D we've watched some movies together..studied together..and had gr8 times together.hope u hv a gr8 future ahead and we stay in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunal-sharma">kunal sharma</a></p>
<p>Sujat Jain, our Captain COOL , Very friendly in nature and the most mature individual in our group (ob). Doesn’t leave a single chance of adding “ghee” to the fire and enjoys every bit of other people arguing. People say that he is a mystery man, its hard to read whats going on in his mind, but truth be told I doubt even he is fully aware of himself. Reserved in his own ways, he is fun to be around. You cannot get bored in his presence, the tharkiness that drips from his face alone is sufficient to bring a smile on your face. Multi-talented without a doubt (maybe there is something special about people born in the 80’s (:P) including me :D), he is a friend you would want to hold on to for the rest of your life… future holds some big surprises for you buddy and I know you would succeed for the hardworker that you are.. best of luck bro..  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shakti-thakran">Shakti Thakran</a></p>
<p>Sujat Jain aka the captain of all things.Be it cricket,studies,girls or motivating everyone to do chudaap. Very genuine at heart sujat will do anything to help out his friends.A very chilled out guy,he always does things when they are necessary and his sharp mind, hard-working nature and his shortcut methods are his tools.Although i came to know him a bit late,we had many good times together and it was a honour knowing and hanging out with you.Keep in touch and don't just stop after good starts(applies for everything). All the best for your future endeavors!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-thakare">Nakul Thakare</a></p>
