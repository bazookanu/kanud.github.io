<h1 class="page-title">Sujay Muzumdar</h1><p>Sujay Muzumdar will probably be 

remembered by our group for getting 

inexplicably excited around 

lunch/dinner time. Perhaps he is the 

best indicator of the clock striking 

8pm (only if he isnt wound up playing 

his silly DOTA games). We all have 

been with him for 3 solid years now, 

and we still have no clue how he 

takes 15 min to get 'ready' for the 

mess :D Hygiene lover beyond 

imagination, he can conduct a 

national workshop on the subtle art 

of cutlery selection. This guy has 

some extremely stringent beliefs and 

principles and it is amazing to see 

that he always manages to stick to 

them, no matter what. An extremely 

talented table tennis player, he 

always remains upbeat about random 

football and tennis matches in some 

god-forsaken corner of the world. 

Usually the person who gets picked on 

the most by us, we have had some 

rib-tickling times with him (Rangoli, 

anybody?). A particularly fascinating 

thing about Sujay is that he always 

manages to be all happy and bright 

smiles, whatever be the day, time or 

planet in favour.  Self-crowned 

Observer-in-Chief of our group, he's 

been the source of much fun talk at 

the mess table, livening up the sad 

food and forever etching those 

wonderful times into my memory.Of 

course, I can never forget that this 

guy was my first friend on campus.  

He has been a steadfast, loyal and 

true friend for all this time that we 

have known each other, a person you 

know you can depend on always, for 

all reasons; a true all-weather 

friend.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>" Auppaa SHIT " " Au papa papa " ... these were the words which used to come out of his mouth when he used to play TT in common room. And from then his name was changed from Sujay Muzumdar  to Appa :).... Appa is a sweet simple , down to earth person which made him my one of the best friends on campus. Appa I will miss you definitely :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saikat-mitra">Saikat Mitra</a></p>
<p>Appa, as I fondly call him, is the most sporting guy I have met on campus. I have called him so many names, said bad of him, even claimed hin to be the father of Pappu's father, but this guy never took offense, merely laughed it off. You truly are great! Other than that, this guy is addicted to DotA and when not playing talks abt it all the time! He is also a fellow lover of LotR and thats gives us enough material to talk for ages. This guy is the best TT player I have ever played with, the only one in AH4 whom i have not defeated in TT :( His backhands are truly _/\_  A fellow economics students, I wholly rely on him and Shivang for syllabus, notes, attendance and all (i hardly attend classes :P) If you wanna do random masti, this is the go-to guy and evening with him in pappus room and indeed memorable :)
1 more year together.....lets make that a blast!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>

<p>A pro TT player. We all played TT, but it was him who took it seriously and worked hard to be the master at it. We have played chess also a couple of times.
He knows everyone's ID and photo.
In 1-1, when I sent him a friend request on Orkut,( He didn't know my name at that time) He replied "who r u?" So I just told him my ID number and it worked. He had my photo and ID in the database in his brain. 
An honest guy overall.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Appa! TT was how we got to know each other.One of the best players in the hostel.Those innovative serves. Killer backhand. I'll always remember those hours spent in the Common Room playing TT. A fellow Federer fan. An ardent Barca supporter.A pro DotA player (keeps telling everyone how great a game DotA is :D). Talks a lot.Non-stop should I say! Has a really good G,K.
All in all, a really amazing person and a great friend for the past 3 years.
Be as you are and DO stay in touch :)

<p>Sujay is one of the first few friends that i made in BITS. He is the most optimistic person that i have ever met in my life. No matter how bleak the situation is, he always finds a ray of hope to cheer you. He has been a person whom i always looked forward for help. He has been my best friend and helping neighbour all these three years. Sujay was one of the most innocent member of our friend circle but thanks to me, uppal and his DOTA chatroom things have changed. He is a hardcore LOTR and Harry Potter fan. Ask him anything about it and he has answer on the tip of his tongue. And not to forget, one more talent that this guy has is remembering ID's, names, marks.... of people. Point out any XYZ person in campus and Sujay will instantaneously tell his details. Not to miss, Sujay has been a scapegoat for many of our pranks and mess jokes. But one thing that i appreciate is the way he takes all of it positively without minding it.He is one friend who I will surely miss after college life.

<p>popularly known as "@pp@". One of the closest friends of mine on campus. He is *an*, probably *the*, Optimist. This nature of 

his has changed my pessimistic attitude and helped me develop positive thinking in the past 3 years. A die hard fan of Sachin 

Tendulkar, Roger Federer, FC Barcelona, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings. Reading Novels is his most passionate hobby. One of 

the best TT players in our hostel and in our batch too. He also has a lot of fascination towards games like Battle For Middle 

Earth, FIFA, etc and addiction for DOTA :P He is in love with DOTA, just inseparable :D Always cheerful, extremely fun-loving, very humble, sticks to his beliefs and rules irrespective of anything, does everything at the speed of light, a very,very good advisor, has lots of patience towards his close ones, talkative (and repetitive in his talk) and enjoys narrating incidents :D He tends to notice many subtle things about people in the surroundings. He has extremely good memory (people call him IDpedia as he knows the ID's of about 75% of the ppl of 

2009 batch even without knowing them personally). Its very easy to make friends with him and he even excuses others' mistakes 

very quickly, especially when it comes to his close ones. Thanks to him and his long hours of advice, my cry-baby nature has disappeared and i started enjoying life a lot better than before. Really honoured to have a friend like him. @pp@ _/\_<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ch--sai-prasanth">Ch  Sai Prasanth</a></p>

<p>Appa. Epic guy. Never met nyone like him. An extremely jovial guy who always looks for the best in things. A pro player in TT. I used to defeat him in 1st year but after that it was rape from 2nd year onwards. Remember the 2v2 fifa 11 appa and bfme. we had a few epic games. I will remember appa getting excited everday at exactly 8 pm and appa and bara communicating with each other at the top of their voices from their rooms, much to my amusement. All the best appa.

<p>Okay, i have only 9 minutes to write this testi.Appa was my very first friend in BITS. But we started talking regularly only after 2-1. Sujay has the sharpest mind in the campus, which is evident from his talent of remembering ID nos of students, not only from our batch but seniors and juniors too. He is a very jolly fellow and always greets you with a smile. He is a pro tennis player and i will always remember him as the tennis playing "oppaaaa" shouting guy. He is a pro gamer and the fastest learner of games. Though he is addicted to Dota (my fault really) and is a pro player, he doesnt let it come in way of his studies :P . His record in acads is just exemplary and worth immitating XD . No seriously, if he studies for just a week, he is sure to top a course. Although he admires female beauty, I am damn sure that he has a crush on me. He doesn't like people interrupting him when he talks to his close friends, and will scold you if u do so. He has a short temper , but becomes normal very quickly.Ohh and i forgot, he is a football maniac and a walking encyclopedia,  and also a Federrrrrerrrr fan \m/ . I will be shameless and say this aloud, appa i love you and will always love you :-*. all the best for your future.
