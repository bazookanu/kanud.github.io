<h1 class="page-title">SUKRUT MHATRE</h1><p>CDC King! AOE-3 star and a great guy overall.Sukrut is one person whom I've known from my very first sem and have managed not to screw up our friendship till now :P . He is a natural when it comes to working hard, if he decides that something needs a lot of effort. Yes sometimes his attitude towards somethings esp. MBA can be a little offensive, don't worry that is nothing compared to the amount of swears he uses up in one time :P If you wanna hangout at any time, he's the guy you go to. An awesome friend and a even better PRO when it comes to CDCs :) I know for sure that he will stand out from the crowd, because he will be the one person shouting "MBA sucks" inside the IIM campus :P Trust me he can actually do that. A die-hard mechie, his passion for aerodynamics and love for cars is commendable. May success be with him wherever he goes. Enjoy and have fun :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>I knew him since 1-1 but mostly for his laziness. It is during PS-1 I saw his passion at Mech things. Now we are mess buddies. If he decides to achieve something then he will put in lot of efforts. Aerodynamics is his territory. He loves to buy big books from Flipkart etc. and has the patience to read them. he has got excellent understanding. I have always enjoyed working with him on various projects.( especially MEMS :P). We think in similar manner on various things like BITS Mech Profs, M***gement etc.
Always remember what Miguel Sir told us. "Go in some R&D and Don't sell soaps".
Disclaimer: If u want your testimonial to get approved by him, do not use the word 'management' in it. Just write 'M***gement' instead as I did :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paris-mulye">Paris Mulye</a></p>
<p>Sukrut was one of my first friends on campus, who later turned out to be one of my best friends here. I still remember him cribbing in the first sem about not getting into IIT, but then he stopped comparing BITS to IIT and started to enjoy his life here. He is so good in Mechanical subjects that he was nicknamed the CDC King :D. Above all, he is an extremely friendly person and one who will always be willing to help (he always used to come to my room during exams and would always try to relieve my tension). He also has lots of stories of his childhood and college days (the best one being how he managed to get admission into Jai Hind) and has an uncanny sense of humor. Even though doing MBA with him would be real fun (:P), I wish he pursues a career of his choice and does well in life. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
