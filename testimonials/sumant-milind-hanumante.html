<h1 class="page-title">Sumant Milind Hanumante</h1><p>Academic Genius.
He is the guy that aces all subjects without being called a nerd. Dharmaani CS ani Karmaani EEE-a really lethal combination. His dedication to learn something is amazing and almost unreal.And by 'learn',i mean 'master'.
The Sumant-Aniket wars were an endless source of entertainment in 1-1.
Programmer,Gamer,and Genius!

<p>So I first came across Sumant when we were in 8th, for the IIT Pre-Foundation class. I only ever met him twice back then, since I left that class after two lectures :D
Sumant is without a doubt, one of the most talented people I've ever met. People who play CS will understand what I mean when I say, I can always count on him when I go solo on A short =D .... He plays AoE too, and really well. Actually, Sumant is the kind of guy who will just crack anything you throw at him. Anything. 
Alright clanmate, enough said... I just wanted to wish you goodluck with whatever you decide to do next... We'll obviously keep in touch x-D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
<p>The last living descendant of the legendary Saiyan race, Sumant is the most multidimentional and complete person I will ever come across in my life. This guy can do anything and everything that is thrown at him. An excellent football, tennis, TT and badminton player, and an even better CS and AOE player, he gets stronger and stronger after every battle!.He loves football(Man Utd \m/) and countless TV shows(just like me :P).He aces every exam with minimal efforts(including watching The Dark Night before the exams), his programming skills and clear thinking abilities are beyond human reach.But then, he is a Super Saiyan. I have no doubt whatsoever that you are going to be a huge success in your life. Keep it up! Will be a part of your Entourage for life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>

<p>Sumant is one of the most multi talented persons I have ever met met.A Pro gamer :AOE, CS and many more, a genius in Academics-pro coder, excels in sports. I know him from my school days as a topper and outstanding student. He excels in whatever he does. He is a perfectionist. He always does whatever he thinks right. He has great clarity in his concepts, thinking which is unique. CP2 practicals would not have been fun without Sumant and Aditya. We had a great time working together at SKF. I am glad to have a friend like him.I wish you All the Best for your future and may you do your best in whatever you choose to do!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>
<p>Sumant is very honest,loyal and humble guy.The quality of his I admire the most is his selfrespect (_/\_).Sumant can only be described as a true genius. I remember the days when he used to be awake till 3 am (still is :P) as exams approached.Later we came to knew he watched TV series all the time.. WTF!!  but true.Sumant puts in very little efforts when it comes to acads , but is able to succeed brilliantly all thanks to his brain.Someone knowing him very little may get a inferiority complex right away .Sumant is a procoder and a awesome gamer .Besides acads, sumant is a good football player and a big ManU fan.Speaking of football I remember the +2 days when we used to play football  ...Vardhan breaking his hands and legs,Akash throwing stones at us and Anish breaking windows.Sumant also is a very generous guy when it comes to money.But he gets very fidgety when people dont return him after a day or so.Another fact about him is he always accepts challenges may it be 100 crunches in 5 mins or food eating competition with Mrinmay.I hope he does complete any of my given dares in near future.Sumant has also been the Chickipedia guy ,really thanks for keeping us update with real part of Facebook. This guy has almost finished all of the (unspoiled :D) TV series,manages to get time to read novels and still excels at his acads ..hats off ..a true genius.We have always been around may it be 8th classes , may it be @ MP and now @ BITS , I never remember a day when we don't try to pull each others leg :D.What can i say we don't belong to the "lick" category.I really wish you all the luck in the future , I wish you may excel in whatever you decide to do .. I know you will. In years to come I still may be drinking coke and you perhaps scotch but remember always be there to say Cheers!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prathamesh-dilip-gaikwad">Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad</a></p>
<p>Ameya Foods or Sumant as they call it is no ordinary human. Most of the time he is seen doing some kind of time pass but when you see his CG you are perplexed! When the hell does his study??He is in every sense the all rounder of BITS.....plays football, plays AOE, CS and also dances wildly during DJ's ;)  Me and Sumant are always spotted hanging out together at NC, Mongi , IC or Shahi. Sumant is very thankful to me as I have introduced to some new dishes that he never tasted before like 'Malai Kofta' and 'Malai TIkka' :P He loves Malai :P :P  I still remember when just you and me were in the mess for 3 hours discussing on various topics (dunno where was everybody that day). It's always fun to be around Sumant and this I think is mainly because me and Sumant share same interests ;)  Really a genius _/\_ ....Will miss him after college! Wish you all the best for all your endeavours!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Sumant. The guy who's mastered the art of mastering everything. Seriously, this guy's a true genius whether it be acads (EG? :D) or other activities. Its very likely that that you'll find him on some server, or, watching Burn Notice (duh) before some exam, but no matter, Sumant simply aces 'em all. He's always up for any challenge, and you can be sure that he'll come out on top. That apart, Sumant loves betting against me but... uh uh. :D Our discussions on any topic always end in disagreement (and you know who's always right), though I guess its more fun that way. Sumant is a brilliant gamer and he's the true star of Exodus, always saving our asses with aces (though you didnt get one against GyD). Sumant is brilliant at all sports, be it football, TT or badminton. He's a big United and Spurs fan, though he's always ribbing me about my football predictions. Cheer up, there may yet be a day when Spurs finish in the top 4 :D. Sumant is a total foodie (he even eats all the delicious mess dishes). We both love to eat a lot, remember that meal at IC? He's always there to "help" me finish any parcels from home (Please stop calling it kaju barfi). He's also a TV show buff and his favourite TV show is Gossip Girl. And umm.. can't comment on his driving skills though, well, mostly cause he doesn't have any! While reading this testimonial, you may have noticed the word, brilliant, used repeatedly. Well that's the only way to describe this guy. After three years, we've become the best of friends and we'll always be so. Please continue to come up with more innovative nicknames for our mutual friend! All the very best for everything. Cheers mate!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ameya-karambelkar">Ameya Karambelkar</a></p>
