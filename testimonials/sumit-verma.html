<h1 class="page-title">Sumit Verma</h1><p>A really energetic and enthusiastic neighbour, friendly and humble. Very focussed about academics and little bit too excited about AAOC courses. I think the 'C' in aaoc stands for Chemical. Very sporty to take chemical jokes of the entire corridor and I must mention, a heck of a room you've got there. I have enjoyed all the times we would gang on Shabbar, was great man. You are destined for great successes and I wish you the very best of luck!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
