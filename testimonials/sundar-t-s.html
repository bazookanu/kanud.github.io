<h1 class="page-title">Sundar T S</h1><p>Sundar-One of the most unique guys on campus. He is a treasure house of PJ's some of them so complicated that you have to sit down and think for a while to figure them out. Dunno how he manages to come up with all that. An awesome drummer and one the core members of the music club.A real music lover at heart. Whenever i have go to his room i always find him listening to random music or beating on the desk with his drum sticks. But i still think he would have been even more suitable for the drama club with the kind of facial expressions he sometimes lets loose (XD). A small warning to all the the readers -NEVER, i mean never ever sit in a vehicle when hes driving,trust me it never ends well :D. He stops the car for crows sitting on the road, but hits the accelerator when he sees people crossing. I really enjoy this guys company.Witty and funny -though it takes a bit of processing time to figure out that what he said was intended to be a joke and even more to actually understand the joke..by the time u finally figure all this out he would have cracked his next one :D .A really great friend.Will never forget all the great times we had. Will be hearing a lot more of his PJ's next sem. Rock on....and while u r rocking plzz teach me how to play the drums next sem :D  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>Our very own, one in a million, the first and the only Londa, Sundar. He's your typical introvert who speaks only when spoken to, and minds his owns business. And then you get to know him. Once that happens your life changes. You discover that this prolific drummer is one hell of a character. The amount of crazy fun I've had with Sundar in the jam room, and outside will be one memory i will always cherish. Be it the 4-hr pointless jams with just drums and one guitar when we had nothing better to do, the unforgettable trip to Chennai, the bogmalo trips or, of course our stage performances, i've always seen him smile and look at the bright side of things. We've only properly got to know each other since last semester, but in such a short span of time we've become really good friends. Not many people have seen him let his hair down and let loose, and trust me, you're missing out on something really awesome in life.
As a bandmate, Sundar is the best drummer i could have asked for. He's very dedicated, and i see him playing drums professionally in the future for sure.And hopefully i'll be playing guitars alongside him. 

PS: I want to listen to you sing Fade Out again. :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>Sundar..a very simple and down to earth guy and an excellent drummer!! A very nice guy..a strict veggie(:D) thats wat i know abt sundar:) All the best for ur future..and keep playing drums..u are really good at it:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shalima-sreenath">Shalima Sreenath</a></p>
<p>He is undoubtedly one of the best musicians I've come across. The way he grasps things on the drums is unbelievable. Probably the only drummer in the world who doesn't make orgasmic faces while playing that well :D
Very few people know but he as a very different approach towards singing some songs. His rendition of "Killing In The Name Of" is remarkable, its impossible to believe how he single-handedly gave the song a new dimension with just an egg-shaker. He's also remixed a famous Bollywood song, which is under production :D
I got to know him this semester the best because we formed a band and went to IITm to participate in competitions. Jamming was the best fun. I've never known a session where we've turned back and pestered him to play something. It was always like playing and singing to ingenious samples or drum-tracks. There are a thousand incidents that I'll always remember with him but one very hilarious incident was during the Western Acoustic event in IIT this year. I was pissed and restless cos we hadn't prepared well for the event, and when we were Sundar was playing "dandiyaan" with his drumsticks backstage. So we went up on the stage and started playing our version of "Crazy", we'd played it before but never with drums. We started the song and Sundar played this insane groove (which he says was very basic and what not) and you can still see our faces on stage, we were ready to take it away! It turned our brilliant. Then after a pause of 10 seconds, we palyed the intro of our own song Esco-bar Incident and when the first stop in the song happened, NO ONE knew when we had to start. Everyone was waiting for each other and Sundar with his blank face started the drums! Hahaha! IT was hilarious, we laughed for a long time when we saw the video! INSANE fun man!  And many such incidents will make me miss him a lot when he leaves college, but I hope we continue the band or atleast play with each other whenever we get time off.
But above all, he's been one of the most simple, humble and soft-spoken people I've met in college. Very positive. Again, very few people would know about his brilliant sense of humor, some Old Man's medicine and his jokes can make you laugh for days!  
I know I will meet you tomorrow again and that this thing will hold much value when you leave the college but since its already up, why not! Haha!  

And yes, he's the founding member of a rebellious youth organization called "Shera Di Kaum", watch out :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-kotwal">SIDDHARTH KOTWAL</a></p>
<p>Sundar Thondikullam Subrahmaniam... there is one and only one guy in this world like him!! a rare kind!! the man of absolutely no expressions!! Whether someone died or he won a lottery, he has only one expression! And the most peace loving and down to earth person ever! You even put ur hand down his throat, he will not tell you anything.. sometimes he reminds me of Jesus! An epitome of forgiveness! And the most talented drummer i hav ever come across.. and i m proud to say that he is my Guru in what ever little about drumming i have learnt.. and to add to it all, self taught!! A very true killer fan of music. His playlist is huge and the genres are sometimes even never heard of! Nytime u go to sundar's room, he's either sleeping, listening to music or practising drums!! He is a small man.. in physique.. but large brains! We have had some very awesome times together in campus and during  our PS1 together! The taxi dance which we did together is historic and hilarous!! The bike trip with sundar behind is bound to go wrong sumtyms.. near death experiences in the vagatore bike trip, driving into some farm on another trip and the accident during our PS1 in Chennai.. all had sundar behind!! :P Even with cars, sundar's driving is bound to make the trip exciting. He has an inbound love for crows and inbound hatred for humans :P. A crow sits on the road and sundar will stop the car, sound the horn and wait till it moves away.. but seeing people on road, he steps hard on the accelerator. He is the oldest chap amongst us who had known the pleasures of life before coming to college :P . The PS1 will never have been the same if it wasnt for sundar.. his eagerness to explore places have sometimes landed us in the most shittiest and sometimes even the best places in chennai! He has a rather complicated sense of humour.. any1 new to it will find it a lil slow to process and then laugh. And I sure as hell will miss him (a LOT!) and the jam sessions in the music room (although only ur drums made sense) and him teaching me drums! I m sure he will turn become a great drummer and even go professional!! I wish him all the best in his future and also wish that he never change!! :* <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charly-poul">Charly Poul</a></p>
<p>If you have ever seen Sundar change an expression or if you have ever seen him raise his voice. YOU do not exist. That is Sundar, a peace loving, expressionless guy. Sundar Thondikalam Subramanian was in hiding for the first week in campus. He was afraid of all the ragging and then he came out from his cocoon. He has been a really great friend ever since. His PJ's are insane and can bust open our head.He speaks only when spoken to and minds his own business most of the time. My fellow madrid and ronaldo fan, weve teamed up in many arguments against messi and barca (FUCK BARCA). It is amazing how we puts up with all our comments and still never loses his temper. Totally un-freakin-believable guy...he is a great drummer and makes all of us proud when he is on music club perfomances. The jam sessions with sundar in the music room will never be erased from memory. This cool guy can pick up beats within second and play along. Even though i make stupid mistakes in counting, he adjusts the beats to still be in syncrhonism ( That is just GODMAXXX) . Sundar is a bad omen whenever u are on a bike ride with him as pillion. Well his car-driving feels just like horse riding. :P.  I am sure that sundar will go professional with his drum career. He is so passionate about drums that he always listens to music and practice in his room.His laptop has got nothing else but  mp3s. I am looking forward to his band going on record and hope to see him play alongside legends in the future. As the amazing being that u are right now, Never change..(but u can train to have  a few expressions on ur face, for instance happy = :) sad =:( too happy = :D ) etc etc. :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/seby-jacob">Seby Jacob</a></p>
<p>Our very own londa ! I've known him since first year from the Music Society, and it's been one hell of a ride. Every single song played, every single jam session has been amazing with this guy around. As a Drummer, words can't describe how good and proficient he is at it. With this guy backing up the Beat section, there is never an instance where you have to worry about losing time or sounding too drab. There is no doubt that he is one of the most unique and creative percussionists out there. He is so, so groovy behind the kit, and any and everything he plays enables you to think of ways to play the same old shit with a twist !
He is by far and large one of the most dedicated musicians i have ever come across. Even while we're busy with assignments and tests and shit, this guy will find time to go and practice drums alone. Sundaaaar, you're gonna go a long way :)

Apart from that, this guy is an absolute gem of a person. Doesn't talk much, doesn't say much, doesn't intrude much, but get him drunk, and you'll have one hell of an entertainer. I can never forget our trip to IITm where, we saw a completely different side of this guy. As i said to everyone else, "Sundar's the find of the trip". His one liners can tear you into a 15 min fit of laughter.  So watch out for this guy.
I hope we get to play music together in the future, and it's been an absolute treat to have him alongside for the last 3 years... But for now, we've got a sem full of music.. let bring the house down.. Free jayzz style ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aseem-patil">Aseem Patil</a></p>
<p>One thing I learned from Sundar is that there is no shame in following your passion, that you are not weird or abnormal because you love something so much. His love for music is amazing. He knows every song, every artist and every album. He is always in his room practicing or listening to music .I don't know much about music, but from what I've heard this guy is the one of the most talented persons in the music club. It’s a joy to watch him play with so much ease and confidence. He’s a great driver. He’s also passionate about F1 and that is where he learns all his driving skills. He’s committed to poker so much that he’s never out of his poker face. For the past 3 years he’s been an awesome friend to me. Had some great times together.PS 1 at IP rings, staying together in that shit hole for 2 months, irritating him till he wanted to kill me, the football arguments, the cdc’s we raped XD, the cdc’s that raped us, the dhoodsagar trekking, being left alone when the mime club had practice, onam dance etc. etc. He’s been an awesome N. Bro. Man going to miss you like hell. Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
<p>Another one of my mallu friends. Apart from being a mech buddy , he is also one of the best drummers on campus. I remember him from his first year, when I first met him in the Music Society. He was this silent and shy person who hardly ever spoke. Since then, he has changed and improved a LOT!. Not only has he become this fun loving and chilled "Londa" ( :P ) but he has also multiplied his drumming skills manifolds. As one of the Music Club seniors rightly said, it is a complete treat to watch him play insane groves on the Drums. And yes as someone mentioned earlier, he is probably the calmest drummers who does not show his emotions on the drums by making contorted faces and pointlessly headbanging :P. Not many might know this but he used to play the "Mridangam" as well for some time and it is very evident that he is one of those percussionists who do not need to count or keep track of the time signatures or beats. He is just born with it. I have had the privilege of playing with him in a few songs together in campus and outside as well. We had insane fun when we went to IIT Madras`s cultural festival and played as a band. No matter how depressed or frustrated the whole group was, Sundar would be chilled as always and even managed to lighten the mood with his epic renditions of classics like " Laila mai Laila ( Read londa mai londa :P )" and other activities ( Subtle hints towards the Shera Di Kaum nite :D ). Hope you achieve all that you had set out for and stay in touch :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>My first day in campus: this guy came to my room saying we are from the same place– that’s when I first met Sundar TS. He was not to be found anywhere the next week. Then he resurfaced, with his witty one-liners and parody songs. He always has funny retorts or comments to make and they’re never lame. What makes it even more amusing is that you need to think a bit before you can figure it out. He is one of the most gentle and calm people around. A passionate music lover and an excellent drummer – You can always find him practicing drums on his desk, on books or any surface he can find.  I am sure that with his dedication and skill he will be a great ‘drummist’. He is passionate towards all kinds of music and has been the greatest influence on my musical taste.
Sundar is a completely different person when driving: his respect for living beings (except humans), his tendency to stop in the middle of the road - even if it is in a junction or in front of oncoming Lorries. Almost everyone who had a bike trip with him has an accident to speak of. 
I’ve had so many memorable experiences with him participating in quizzes, playing football and badminton together, discussing about music, football or completely random stuff. He is an amazing person to be with and a great friend. I hope to have many more experiences with him in the future.
Wishing you the best in life<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashin-george">Ashin George</a></p>
<p>Faad drummer. Faad matlab faad. He's gonna go professional very soon.  Also the guy I go to if I wanna learn something new about the subject. Very witty and takes lite, be it acads or otherwise. Hope to see you play in a jazz-influenced rock band sometime.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
