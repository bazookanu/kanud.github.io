<h1 class="page-title">Supan Shah</h1><p>Supan!!!! Isnt this my pleasure to write about him :-)
most famous guy in the hostel.... without any doubt
very sporty guy with regular appearance in cricket, kick volley, TT and many more 
also known as supan-man for his abilities to climb anywhere to get a stuck football or cricket ball
brilliant in acads as well... getting continuously good grades while doing so many things is not very simple
his devotion to the mime club is also very well known
he is king chudaap jokes too
with so many to list as plus points, he will reach new heights undoubtedly.....
stay the way you are and dont forget us :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-deshpande">sahil deshpande</a></p>
<p>Supan is gujju superman. Cricket khelega, fifa addict hai, timepass karega duniya bhar ka, Mime club ka subcoordi hai or end mein 9.5+ leke aayega. He aces in almost everything he does.
 I met him while in lib when me and saboo were staring at him and calling him 'penchor' as he stole her pen :P . And since then we've been good friends, study partners, random bakwaas partners. It's been awesome knowing you supan shah! cheers! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Supan or Pansu as I like to call him is the face of the hostel, whether its his presence in the common room cracking jokes and livening up the mood or his acting in the AH4 hostel video that won us the first prize. I came to know him mainly because we used to play TT against each other a lot. He still remains one of my favourite TT opponents :D. He is very spontaneous and carefree by nature. A very gifted mime artist, he has truly put up some of the most amazing performances I have ever seen. And the best thing about him is that he manages all these and yet tops his acads (and that's not an easy thing considering that he is in CS which is full of nerds :P). All in all, a  multi talented person who is a loyal and a very good friend of mine. He will be leaving for PS in the 1st sem so I will definitely miss his presence, especially as far as common room is concerned. All the best Supandi, you will go a long way :)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>

<p>Supan! One of a kind. One of the most visible faces on the campus. So full of energy! Never seen anyone so enthusiastic about life.Our friendship really took off in the Common Room way back in the first year where we used to play TT for hours at a stretch. Even the formidable Appa fears playing against him :P. Playing Volleyball for AH4 for the past three years was such fun, his Chudaap keeping us entertained all the time. As a fellow Puppy Power player, he was quite instrumental in our unexpected run to the semi-finals of Spree Futsal. Those day long Gully Cricket sessions we had, the HPL-all these things wont be forgotten for a long time to come! And yes, Kick-volley during exams =D. By the way he also happens to be a CS phodu, a reallllly intelligent person. Also a pro Mimer (that Ramdev Baba act was just too hilarious man!). We've had some really great times through all these years- be it Bogmalo or random Chudaap in hostel. I am quite certain he'll end up in Google/Microsoft/Facebook in a few years from now =D. Till then do stay in touch. Long live and prosper.

<p>Supan is one funny guy. Always making stupid jokes and fooling around. I love trying to imitate his voice. Its bad but its still funny :P Was my manager for BPL2010 and had so much fun winning as the underdogs. Always there to help me when i need notes and or i need help with acads. He decided to start living in the library from 2nd year:P Keep in touch man. All the best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/naveen-benny">Naveen Benny</a></p>
