<h1 class="page-title">Supriya Kajjidoni</h1><p>Supriya has been one of the best friends I have made in campus. A highly dedicated, sincere, hard-working and down-to-earth person one could easily befriend. She has been a source of inspiration for me to attend classes, I must say, and often source of information of the happenings in the same. We, by the grace of fate, happen to share the same regional background, branch and day of birth (which I noticed just now :D). It has been a great journey together and sadly all good things come to an end. I wish you all the very best in your future endeavors and a bright career ahead. Farewell and do keep in touch!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srikanth-h-v">SRIKANTH H V</a></p>
<p>Supriya : what a personality! I must admit that anyone would be glad to have the personality she has. A well read individual, she always leaves me amazed by her right choice of words at the right time.We have had some amazing outings together with many hilarious memories.I also admire her will power which makes her go to gym almost everyday while others shirk. She has amazing stamina and physique.All in all she is a person who temperament matches with mine which is why we had a great journey together....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mimosa-sarma">mimosa sarma</a></p>
<p>I really got to know Supriya only the last semester and I really regret not getting to know her before. She was one of the few people who didn't mock my apparently accented Kannada, for which I'm very grateful. Very warm and friendly, it's great fun to chat with her. I'll most remember her has the girl who calmly chewed gum in Analog labs- that is the height of cool!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>

<p>Hmm... Where do I start? It was only at the end of the first semester, that I really got to know her, having first met in one of the kannadiga meetups in the beginning, and she's been one of my best friends ever since. She usually pings me with something like "My MATLAB isn't working." and later on  jumps off to completely random things, and then there's no end to it.. A nice, simple, sincere and hard-working person, a true music aficionado, loves to keep sharing her music all the time... Her priceless kannada music collection was something I would have never come across had I not known her. Loves to cook, and has the knack to precisely detect how something was prepared, from the first bite. They say that you learn something from every friend of yours, and the one thing that has influenced me is her nonexistence of laziness and her discipline towards her duties... something that I still look up to. And all those endless calls for help with her laptop (including the taunts of "english please :x" ) have indeed been a challenge to me and shall be cherished! :) Keep em coming!  Well, it's been wonderful having known you all these years. Do keep in touch, and wishing you success in your future endeavours and all the best for an awesome career ahead! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pavan-agnihotri">Pavan Agnihotri</a></p>
<p>This girl has the guts not to be lost in the crowd(respect). I came to know her through our mutual liking for poetry. She is the kind of person who will stand by her opnion no matter what( came to know this through the various debates we would have on politics and other random stuff.  Her style of writing amazes me, she has the knack to dole out these wonderful pieces meticulous in detail yet hugely imaginative. She is a really good friend and a very warm person. Slightly reserved , she might appear to be much of an introvert but when you come to know her you will be pleasantly surprised. Have had some great times with you. Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>

<p>Its difficult to find people from North  Karnataka studying outside. So I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that she was from Dharwad (Finally...somebody could understand my accent...). A voracious reader(has read tons of books), TV series addict , a brilliant blogger, a really good cook( I think you made those sweets u brought me for Deepawali) and a staunch feminist.Always ready to help others.Sits in the front in the classroom and gives the impression that she is concentrating (but she's busy doing more important stuff like writing poems and song lyrics). A great friend and a very soft spoken person but loves to crib (:P). All the best for you future and I can envisage you taking the road not taken by many other people and doing something radical. I wish you a happy and a Successful life.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>Supriyaaaaaaaaaaaaa~~~~  BooHooohooo. This really is our last sem together isnt it :'(
You are the most multi-talented person i know ( not that i know a lot of people). You read a wide variety of books, a great writer , play badminton, (werent u also on ur school's volley ball team? forgive my poor memory.. i'm getting old), BBT lover and you r great at photoshop!! You have great taste and a great sense of humor. And u are a walking dictionary of song lyrics!! A fellow butcher hater ;P... Oh and did i ever tell you i'm a fan of your cartoons?  You are an ALLROUNDER :D
And man!!! Your stamina.... you are super human!! Really! How can you go jogging in the morning AND do the tread mill AND play badminton for HOURS all in ONE day and still be able to get up the next day?? *bows down to you in respect* 
I also really admire your strong personality. You give off a very confident vibe. Someone who knows exactly what she wants to do and does not waver because of others' opininons. I have yet to meet another person who is as talented as you are and still so down to earth. 
I believe you have a knack for excelling at whatever you put your heart into and that you will become very successful in life.... and i want to boast proudly that you r my friend :)
Although we live in the same corridor, we became friends only last sem. And i want to keep this friendship forever :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/lasya-boddapati">Lasya Boddapati</a></p>
<p>Supriya !! A girl who has amazing writing skills and can leave you spellbound for the same!! :D This girl is extremely hard working and determined to work.. :P Whenever I think of you I am reminded of those days of when we used to sit in the stairs and tried to study !! Everytime this was followed by a long pause of irrelevant discussions and then reversion to studies again..!! She has full dedication for gym ! Thank you for waking me up so many times for jogging in the morning at 6am sharp although many a times I used to hardly turn up but you made me kick start this habit..!! :) We have had so many b'day celebrations together.. be it mine or yours or for that matter anyone else's along with hours of photo sessions.. :P A girl whose explanations are extremely logical..has great taste of music and the one who has always something interesting to put up as her gtalk status msgs :P !! I wish you all the very best for a bright future ahead and I know you are going to reach the pinnacle of success !! :) Cheers !! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shruti-garg">Shruti Garg</a></p>

<p>Supriya is one of my bestest buddies out here in the campus. She is calm, composed, friendly and extremely helpful. She is a practical human being and does not have any sort of fakeness. She is independent, straight forward and actually does not care about what the world says about her. Coming to academics part i must say that she is extremely sincere, hardworking and dedicated. She does every work with full dedication.. be it studies, extracurricular or anything else.. she is a pro in our technical eni softwares \m/ apart from that she is an awesome T designer too :P both the times her t shirt design got selected.. \m/.. I thoroughly enjoy each and every moment that i have spent with her.. especially the analog labs :P.. where i actually enjoyed to the fullest being her partner. I wish her all the very best for her future.. n wish she becomes a gr8 gr8 Entrepreneur :D.. I am always gonna cherish the memory of moments which i have spent with you and am gonna miss u very very very much!!!!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/barkha-gupta">BARKHA GUPTA</a></p>
<p>Sups! The one person out here who shares my obsession with the Victorian Era. We've known each other since second year, when we started going to informal Matrix Reading club meetings. There used to be the highlight of my week, held every Saturday night at 11 in a corner of the C mess, they would begin slowly, since everyone was shy at first, and then 
blossom into full fledged discussions on numerous books, authors and other random goings-on! Before we knew it, it would be 12.30 am and time for us to return to the hostel. But those meetings were the glue that brought me close to knowing Supriya, this thoughtful, intelligent, complicated personality, with a kind heart and a passion for literature and 
writing that is akin to mine. 
I always enjoy my conversations with her, we can talk of the highly philosophical, or of history, movies (film buffs that we are) or just giggly girly stuff. She is someone I can rely on to give sensible advice and point out the right way to go. Her thoughts and opinions are set in their ideals, and I honour that quality.
I'm sure with her dedication, she'll achieve great heights, and I will truly miss her company when its time to say goodbye to our life on campus.
Stay the same, Supriya - sweet, intellectual and a coffee freak, and wish you all the best for the foggy unknown out there.
We'll always be in touch, as the best of friends, wherever we are! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuva-kulkarni">Anuva Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>A very intelligent, no-nonsense type of person, Supriya is truly unique. She is very conceptual and dedicated towards her studies. A very good writer and even better orator, she has astounding literary skills…when I think about her, these are the things which pops in my mind - reading aficionado who has read almost all of P.G Wodehouse’s novels… coffeeholic who always has a mug ready …lifesaver who always helps me in doing the assignments (sometimes I simply copy)…pretty girl who has lovely hair (:P)… She has a bindass, carefree attitude and an equally amazing sense of humour (remember the talks we had about random people :P). Will never forget you.  Wish you all the happiness and success in life. Keep smiling ?  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akansha-suneria">Akansha Suneria</a></p>
<p>Having supriya as a friend is an excellent example of friendship in itself.  Open-minded, genuine, confident, compassionate and level-headed, she can always be counted on 
to listen and provide support when needed. Through the years, our friendship has grown deeper and stronger, she's the first person I think of calling with good news and the first one I call when I need help.  She is practical than math theories, and understands emotions better than anyone else. She loves animals. You must have seen her many times playing with puppies and feeding them in campus. An awesome cook, she talks about food and its ingredients as if she has done PhD in it.
She is a special part of all of my best BITS memories. Although our lives will take 
different paths, she will be very much a part of my life. Our time together is limited, 
but in my heart I always know she will be only a phone call away at any 
given time. Love you!

<p>Supriya! Our friendship dates back to the TRW times! :P
Oh hell! I can't forget the memories we had - our month long(or 2 rather) series of discussions and quarrels, preparations, rehearsals, tense moments and finally that one presentation which put a smile on our faces and made the whole thing a sweet experience! The group- you, me, Arvind, Aditya Deshpande, Akash Bellubi, Srikanth H.V- it was a great pack with variety and sense to it! Of course, how can I forget that single word which I (unintentionally) sensationalized to blown-out proportions - FEAR!! If there's one thing that stays in my head everytime I meet you, it is this 'fear' factor which reminds me that I can be ribbed endlessly once it gets to me!! :P
This girl is intelligent, hardworking( okay....m getting skeptical here ;) ), brutally honest at times, talented and yes a great friend to hang out with, if an intellectually stimulating discussion is what you're looking for! :)
We've had a lot of discussions on things ranging from psychology to psychiatry to EEEnI (screwed up) marking system n profs to paradigm-shifting books to funny snippets about random people and what not! She's quite the quintessential writer and can conjure up words to fit any scene and describe nearly anything with subtle undercurrents of truth hidden in a fabric of aesthetic poetry! We shared this common interest in poetry, but of course, I've always been the dilettante and herself the pro(and critic too)! One thing I learnt from her is to hold your passion and trade it with nothing (but happiness) and live on bindass!
It's been a great journey with you all along! Be yourself and believe in the difference that you can make! All the best in all your future endeavours! Keep in touch! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/t--vignesh">T  Vignesh</a></p>
<p>Probably the most pleasant thing 

about Supriya is that she doesn't use 

'omg' on gtalk. God sent. You require 

precisely 2 days on her gtalk list to 

understand what sort of a feminist 

she is. Can probably never stop 

pulling her leg over it, and it is 

simply hilarious how offended she 

gets at times :D Apart from that 

cliched girl-will-rule-world streak 

which hits you in your face, there is 

a sort of a dignified no-nonsense 

aura about her (though how she 

endures feminist lit like Jane Eyre 

and other period films  is beyond my 

comprehension) which is so 

refreshingly unique. It is impossible 

to completely describe this woman, 

one will simply run out of 

adjectives. Multi-talented, 

omniscient, omnipotent, omni-

whatever, cheerful (at times) with a 

caustic sense of  sarcasm and a weird 

sense of humour, along with a 

famously sweet temper, she is a 

superb person to have perfectly 

useless debates on gtalk (though I 

dunno how we always manage to end on 

a totally unrelated note :D 

). Psychiatrist-in-chief on campus, 

she can prolly give most legit 

shrinks a run for their easy-earned 

money. Her observation skills are 

amazingly acute! Her ramblings on 

human nature and behaviour are a 

treat to hear, complete with deep 

insights and profound convictions. My 

honour and unbelievable good luck 

that I ever came to know her. High 

Empress of the British empire, 

Admiral General of the unwashed 

masses, kind oppressor of the anti-

feminists, the slightly racist and 

fully weird leader of men and women 

(but women mostly), you are one hell 

of a lady! Privileged to have such 

friends.
P.S.: You are learning RON pretty 

fast, stop cribbing :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
