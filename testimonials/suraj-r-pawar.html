<h1 class="page-title">Suraj R Pawar</h1><p>One of my first friends at BITS and a fellow Mech mate
Excellent singer, composer and amazing artist!
Great mimic and partner in many of the "Beautitiful" and "stick-stuck" jokes<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>The silence. That is probably his defining moment in his journey through BITS Goa. He was the singer who silenced the entire auditorium with his mesmerizing performance. And not many people know this but he is a good photographer himself! He is somebody who values a person for what he really is and that makes me just respect him even more.
It was indeed a pleasure to be in your company and for somebody who loves music, thank you for making it heaven!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charith-kandala">Charith Kandala</a></p>
<p>I think you can say that a singer is good if he makes you want to sing along. Suraj's voice never fails to bring out the love for music in you and persuades you into breaking into a song every time. He is perhaps the most complete musician on campus, skilled at playing the guitar, keyboard and drums too. But on top of all this, he is also affable, modest and friendly.
College would not be the same without this guy as my friend.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>Singing is his Passion and he excels in it, always ready to help, has a great sense of humor, ambitious, confident, hardworking and creative, an awesome friend and a great person to be around with :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Music and Suraj are like two synonymous words that go well together. His passion for this very talent of his, has made him head strong and confident, and will surely take him places in the future. A non-complicated realist, he is a caring friend whose weird humor is something everyone relishes. His capability to achieve anything that he wants in life is commendable. I cannot imagine having survived PS1 without this guy. And neither will I forget the formal lunches in Sem-1 and the amount of support he gave me when I was at an all time low. You Sir, ROCK :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>One of the greatest musicians this campus has ever seen, Suraj can silence a hoard of rowdy people by his amazing singing. He is one of the most dedicated Co-ordinators of the music club and it has been a great honour for me to have worked alongside this remarkable guy. A little shy when it comes to talking with girls but his personality makes him an instant charmer among so many girls around.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-lele">Aditya Lele</a></p>
<p>I have known Suraj only for an year or so, but I have been a big fan of his singing since our Big Break. He is a really sweet, down-to-earth person, with a great sense of humor and amazing mimicry talents. My notes would never have been so popular if he was not there. Loved to be friends with you. Wish you all the best for your life!! :)

<p>Suraj has achieved great heights at his passion for singing along with having a great academic record. That is truly commendable. His jokes have often made me laugh to tears including his brilliant enactment of the people around him, especially the teachers.  I can never forget all those times we have spent just cracking random jokes and trolling around. It'll be really tough not having you around me anymore, with no ones cheeks to pull.
Conquer the world with your aura, your passion and that cute, baby face of yours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>i have known Suraj for 5 years now, and its been a pleasure knowing him and listening to him sing Teri Deewani at all the birthday celebrations in IIT coaching :P, and so much more at all the music nights in college! You have such a brilliant voice, its impossible not to fall in love! We've had great memories all these 3 years, all the outings and birthdays. Wish you all the best and keep in touch <3<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Started talking with him since the very beginning of my BITS life.. became a fan of his singing during Big Break but really started understanding him during my stay at his place and all throughout the PS1 ... Best friend I have ever made in life .. his singing is just heavenly.. and you won't find a more down to earth, determined, smart, simple and happy guy like him. He lives an uncomplicated life and makes ppl around him happy.. be it with his singing or the immitations of profs. I would seriously never forget the many Maggi movie nites we had together. May you achieve whatever goals you ever set for yourself. - HC<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshal-chaudhari">Harshal Chaudhari</a></p>
<p>Suraj was a great friend to me right from the start. He is really passionate about music and has given us some great performances over the years. It will be hard to replace him as a genuine, honest guy with a simple heart and great talent. I hope he has a great life and greater career ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>Suraj R Pawar is one of the most awesome singers I have seen. Its a pleasure to the ears when he starts singing. He is a really friendly person with a positive aura around him. I wish him a great and successful future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>I first met Suraj during my first week in Bits when he was singing "Aadat" at the top of his voice ,practising for the music club auditions. He must have aced those auditions because he went on to become music club coordinator. He is a very simple,down to earth, unselfish person who is always ready to lend a helping hand.  Apart from singing he has also become an accomplished guitarist evident from the last acoustic night held by the club. During out third year,  he has also become the facilitator of  notes for me and every other Mech person without which I wudnt have survived   CDCs.  He is sure to succeed in  his career, whether he opts for music or management!

<p>SIR!! , YOU ROCK!!!!. The best singer in the campus, he never fails to amuse us both onstage and offstage with his music performances and mimics respectively. Truly wonderful guy. Always has the last word like a SIR. Hope you reach great heights. Good Luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Suraj is like the ridiculously photogening guy- he seems to be incapable of doing anything wrong. He’s incredibly talented musically- a brilliant singer and although I never could hear it, I’m sure he’s great at the bongos and octapad too. His mimicry, :sputter:, :bubble:, his mimicry will embarrass you in ways a voice recorder just can’t. And to his eternal credit, he introduced me to vodka. He even told me at what point to stop drinking, but I was pretty drunk by then.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>A pro at whatever he does be it acads , music , management or mimicking professors. An awesome singer and guitarist. He has been supplying me and the whole mech department with Kratis notes during the entire third year( dont know what i would  have done without them).To top it all of hes a very down to earth and helpful person. I wish u a successful future ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
<p>Suraj!!! Our names mean the same---Yeh rishta hai sada ke liye!! Being a corridor mate, Suraj is one of the first guys I met in my hostel. At that time , I didnt think he was a first year student :D
He is one of those really talented guys- can play almost any instrument, can sing almost any song, and can imitate almost any person!! Everytime I visit his room, there is some new instrument. This guy just lives music.In fact, it was Suraj who introduced me to drumming (Thankitty Thanks for that!) I had a really amusing time with him, planning for Zephyr 2011, and he brought out the best (Dil ke armaan!) in me. Talking Acads with him is really a pleasure, because at some time, we both begin to imitate the teachers, and the entire corridor joins in! His mimicry is one of things i am going to miss ( I already miss the Atif Aslam style 'aAAAaaAAAaaAAA' tearing through his room). How he studies is something only he knows. He always has some new game on his comp, and then he pulls an all-nighter and takes the test!! This preparation style of his has always amused me...Thank you Suraj, for all those bathroom passage conversations, and ur unceasing entertainment...Thou shall be missed. All the besttity best!! Make it large!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Suraj Pawar is a member of our famed Corridor quintet ! This guy is multi-talented. To start with, he has that near perfect singing ability. He has a badge to prove it too. He was the Music Club chief co-ordinator of our time. We share many tastes in music and those few but great jamming sessions will always be remembered. He has a knack for playing any musical instrument well owing to his solid understanding of pitch.  Though he is far from being technically perfect, The way he plays jazz on guitar is simply awesome and makes you want to listen to him for a long time. Suraj is also one of the best mimicry artists I have seen. If Suraj is describing an event to me, I know that that is exactly how it occured. His acurrate imitation of College faculty has been a huge source of laughter for the entire corridor and it never gets old. He is also one of those last-minute keedas and makes getting good grades look easy. He also tries to make sense of what he is learning which is a good thing. He is very ambitious too and always tries to take inspiration from deeds of big shot people with 
double digit lpa salaries (Sorry for that one mate :P ). All of us think he is cute albeit he is a self-proclaimed forever-alone guy. Thats good in a way, because if he really does hook up with someone good, My level of envy will reach boiling point :P I will never forget the epic dancing sessions (its Friday! :D) and also the way you awkwardly smiled when I poked you on your stomach :P All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishan-joshi">Ishan Joshi</a></p>
<p>A voice which the campus recognizes, Suraj has been a close friend all through my college days. A fellow bogmalo fan, we shared great memories be it at Goa or Kolkata. Suraj also rides the activa damn well..never felt like i was going to die when i was sitting behind him :P 
I enjoyed every moment of your company..ur mimickry is unparalleled.
 Hope you have an awesome career ahead!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sourav-banerjee">Sourav Banerjee</a></p>
<p>The jewel of our corridor - Suraj is by far the best singer i've met in my life. In 1-1 when i didnt know him well, i was a bit irritated with him practicing "Aadat" at the top of his voice :P, But later i became a fan of his singing. He is a true Rockstar in all aspects. Anyone who knows him well must have pulled his cheeks at least once, his cute looking face adds up to his awesome personality. His absent mindedness has been made fun a lot of times but that's the best thing about him, he gets so much involved in whatever he is doing that he doesn't care what's happening around. He does everything with full passion. His Mimicry skills specially of the Mechanical faculty are simply awesome and a constant source of entertainment for all of us :D. Cheers to all the fun we had these 3 years in our awesome corridor may it be the interview session with Shubhanshu or the Friday Dance.. its uncountable. I wish you all the successes in life, aim high and achieve high and stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghavendra-singh">Raghavendra Singh</a></p>
<p>Suraj, Saving Mech students from flunking CDC's since aug'11 . The entire mech batch is Indebted to u. Very cool guy with an awesome voice, extremely talented . Made all my mech labs more entertaining :) :) . all the best for the bright future. Stay in touch. Cheers :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshith-rao-yethapu">Akshith Rao Yethapu</a></p>
<p>Suraj is one of the most joyful people I've met in this campus. The first thing that always comes to my mind are his absolutely incredible imitations, esp of mech profs. An amazingly talented singer, he owned the competition in Saarang events in IIT chennai. He also has an awesome music sense which resulted in his brilliant composition Swarga, that won us that precious third prize and the chance to open for DSP :P. He has also made a huge female fan base there. Being in the core commitee of the music club along with him as the Co-ordinator has been a great experience for me and I have seen him work his ass off sometimes to make up for lazy juniors. Also, the epic chennai trip which was flawlessly organized by him would go down as one of the best memories after coming to this campus. He also comes off as a guy who takes acads lite but still ends up getting crazy high marks in mech cdc's.  Apart from all this, Suraj is a very helpful friend whose photo notes have been the reason behind whatever marks I've got in 3rd year, and also a really good and fun person to be with. I'm sure great things and a great girl await you in the future. ("Shera di kaum yo! :P")

<p>Suraj Pawar Aka  "Chief" is one of the very few extremely talented people I have come across off late. An awesome singer,composer,performer,entertainer,mimic and a very good person at heart, I look upon him as a person who is just so EPIC.
Musoc@Bits GOA is going to miss you and I, for one, Definitely...

<p>"In aavar fectry theire aar vaalves, compressor excetra " to " whaat is the pressur at the critikal paaint- critical pressur " this guy has somehow out of his calm , composed and a whole lot lazy nature has got mechanical engineering  under his control , and NO he does not talk like that ( quiet a shy smooth talker he is :P ) it is one of his many abilities to mimic anybody and everybody under the sun which has made all outings , mongi coffees, NC binges a whole lot of fun ! Not only can he modulate his voice   to the ideosyncracies of multiple people but also with various tones , overtones and beats with that "perfect voice" can send an entire auditorium into uproar . From teri diwani to lukka chuppi this guy has multiplied fans on campus and yeah somewhat reached his dream of being known as the cute guy who sings really well :P Very entertaining to talk to too ; i have thoroughly enjoyed his company through these three years and he will remain one of the most cherished friends i made in college ! I am sure with his calm and steady demeanor this guy will nail all his goals with a wink of an eye ! and i dont need to say the obvious ! ( stay in touch ! :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>
<p>Suraj is a marvelous guy and a superlative musical talent. He is a fantastic singer and plays God knows how many instruments. He has a brilliant sense of humour and can make you laugh till you can't take it any more. He can imitate almost any person with remarkable accuracy and his lively, cheerful attitude makes it a delight talking to him. When it comes to work and serious stuff, he's very sincere and our SOP was a cake walk thanks to his efforts. He's very friendly and totally chilled out - one of the best people i have ever met. It has been a pleasure knowing you and I wish you a wonderful life ahead. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>This guy is multi-talented genius. His calm and soothing voice has silenced the audience time and again. The mimicry of profs he pulls off is outright hilarious. Mech dept owes Krati and him in big way for saving our asses. He has a very huge fan base among girls and is yet very shy person when it comes to talking with them. Our college days would never have been the this awesome without this guy in the group. All the best buddy for the future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kedar-deshmukh">KEDAR DESHMUKH</a></p>
