<h1 class="page-title">Surbhi Khetrapal</h1><p>Surbhi or Shurbhi( as RSP calls her) :- is a very serene, pretty, extremely dedicated, optimistic, never failing to do what u want to kind of an attitude bearing woman, a 'physics queen' .. All of these are what she means to me ! She emanates a pleasant vibe to me  and it is very comforting to be around her ! She seems very confident of what she does and that inspire me ! :)  She is one of those bold ones, who dropped her engineering degree for her love for physics and the confidence that she would not regret it later ! Very appreciable that is ! :-)That apart , I love how you made pencil-notes on light green coloured papers and also the fact that you are starting to like fish curries :P Jokes apart,  Keep shining ! You have a long way to go !:-D Love- Gargi !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gargi-biswas">Gargi Biswas</a></p>
<p>I know Surbhi only since a year when I started my physics CDCs. Initially, I didn't like her at all :P but somehow things have changed and now of course we are very good friends. After doing a few projects/assignments with her, one thing I can tell about her is that she is very adamant. You can convince a professor to give more time but not her! But she can also be a very good teacher (the abhigyan students must have surely benefited). My sole preparation for a seminar that we once gave together was what she taught me in an hour!
Be it physics or whatever, anything she sets her sight on, she gives it her fullest attention and effort. Amazing artist she is! (from Warli painting workshop). Inquisitive and has lots of patience. Loves trekking and travelling out (but also gets panicky to breaks rules.. :P ).

Well, that's all I can write on this space. IM on gtalk sometimes as you won't join Facebook :D

All the best!

<p>Surbhi is one of those few people in campus who know what should be the next move in their life. Her confidence in dropping the engineering degree and her passion and dedication towards Physics is something which inspires everyone. She has a beautiful smile and does things very gracefully.   She is confident, friendly, fun loving and is ready to help you out anytime. The way how she always keeps her room clean, never stops to amaze me!. There were times when her clean room "inspired" me to clean my own room. :D She also gets the credit of introducing me to "Pani Puri" :D ( remember the time your mum brought Pani Puri's ).  Surbhi, I'm sure you'll have a very successful life ahead. Wish you All The Best :) Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
<p>I came to know you properly through gurjari.The way you do things can be so inspiring.You give you your 100% to whatever you do.You can get mingled into anything so easily...it would feel like you were always a part of it and it starts feeling incomplete without you.You were so enthusiastic about learning garba.Once you decided to do something ...you WILL do it.I love the passion with which you do everything.A frank and interesting person.All the best for everything in your future..:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/meghna-mehta">Meghna Mehta</a></p>
<p>Surbhi… my inspiration in physics. She gives her heart and soul to the subject. Till the beginning of the third year all I knew about her was that she was this determined person who was so sure of her choice of pursuing a career in physics, that she dropped her engineering degree. I got to know her very well in the third year and we became very good friends. A person who always follows her heart, she is unique in her own way and I know she just loves being Surbhi Khetrapal. She differs from most people I know in many ways (like writing notes with pencil on stamp paper :) ). She is not the usual gossiping kinds; so engrossed in her physics world and what she has to do next that she does not care about what others are up to or what anybody thinks about her, that just shows her confidence in herself. Extremely dedicated and so eager to learn more that she would avidly read anything she would find related to her subject. Calm, serene, confident, knowledgeable, she is extremely simple, humble and down to earth, always ready to help (many of my physics assignments couldn’t have been done without her) and she’s also a fun company. Hope that one day you make it big in the world of physics (get a Nobel prize and make us proud :P)… Wish you success in anything that you plan to do… Good luck… you will always remain one of the special friends I have made during this year…   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nisheeta-desai">Nisheeta Desai</a></p>
