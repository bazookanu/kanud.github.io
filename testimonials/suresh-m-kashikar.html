<p>My friendly neighbor, not spiderman, Suri! Well, beginning from when we met, you looked like a gentleman, with all shirt tucked in and trousers, well-kempt hair (commando style :D) You attended all your classes. Well all this was true for a few weeks only :P <br>
I spent a lot of my time in waking you up in 1-2 and whole of 2nd yr! :D And that one time, when I woke you up, you came to my room sat on my bed; said that you are not feeling well; went back to sleep, is <strong> true!! </strong> I won't deny the fact that you are lazier than me :D <br>
You took the 'take li8' part of college a bit too seriously :D But you would get mood swings sometimes, study like crazy and totally rock some papers. <br>
A true sportsman, football fanatic, a wonderful laugh. You really screwed up your sleep cycle very well :D Those random all-nighters, and the next day me asking you "kal night out maara?" I'll miss those moments yaar! <br>
You have been very helpful, and cooperative. That sudden trip to Mumbai in 2-1 \m/ <br>
All the best for your future! Keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yachit-mahajan">Yachit Mahajan</a></p>
<p>Thanks to all the bio labs that we know each other. Starting with Microbiology in 2-1 where we used to leave much early than other section(\m/) to the never ending Genetic engg. labs we have talked about a lot of things. Remember "gtalk to ice n spice" and all the talk about BIRDS ;) . A li8 person not at all concerned about academic stuff but gets super excited about some things. All the labs, IC trips and "bio" trips together will always be remembered. Start taking some things more seriously. Wish you all the success in life and remember "el diablo esta nina" :D.
P.S: I still dont agree that it should be called black forest :D. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>

<p>Suresh M Kashikar, thrown into ICF Chennai along with Vivek and myself, ended up becoming roomates. He is a master of languages(English, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil and god knows what else!) and has a good sense of humour. He is also a great gamer(ah, the aoe we played! and he is supposedly much better at CS). If it wasn’t for this guys forging skills, PS would have been a lot worse! :D He is one guy who never loses his cool and always optimistic even in the worst of situations. He is awesome company and we had some great times there. I especially remember us going to Express Avenue and eating at Subway there. I seriously dont know how I would have survived in chennai without him. He really knows how to take 'li8'! All the best dude!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
<p><center> Kage Bunshin No Jutsu </center> <br><center> Finally got it right. </center> And then the Lord said, let there be smile on their faces, and there was Suresh Malateesh Kashikar. Man.. That exuberant smile, that confidence, that style and happy-go-lucky nature.. I love you for all that you are and all that you stand for. I remember how i met you on the first day of class work, asked you where is the water cooler and you help me find it, as if i am going to die out of thirst in the coming few minutes. What i mean to say is that i have seen you helping people. You as well take others' problems as your own and help them even if you end up getting screwed.. As bible says "Do not give a fish to the hungry, teach him how to fish".. This damn testimonial, of course cannot encapsulate this giant of a persona which I attempt to describe. I know this sounds lame but you indeed have a heart of gold. Never has problems with anyone, loves everyone for what they are, is loved by all for the way he is, ready to listen to everyone and to lend a helping hand. Of course there are some moments which piss me off(as in really piss me off), like the einstein moments during debates(he simply does not budge!!).. Those moments when he takes your coke but does not share his(he does that for some weird reason, which believe me, he himself is not sure about) But do all those petty things matter now?? When you see your life in a flash back and you see Suresh Kashikar all the fucking time by your side, him listening to all that balderdash of yours, when you see this gem of a guy always loving you and caring for you. I guess not. He has such an understanding of things that matter,whether it is the football field or his great choice of music or matters of life. With that great sense of humor, i cant recall one time, yes not even one single damn time, when i scored one against him. I wish that we had the same clock-cycle as in me staying up all night or you staying up in the day, cause then we would have seen so much more of each other. You have been one of my bests ever since the first year(when you used to stay up in the day).. Love from the first time I met. To this very moment. You might as well ask, "After all this time?"… To which i would happyly answer "Always."<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
