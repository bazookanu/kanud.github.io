<h1 class="page-title">Sushan Maitra</h1><p>" Sushan without a T " is how he introduced himself to me. This guy is a really down to earth and simple bong :) He is really helpful. I remember when I was really ill and had missed my Gen Bio compre due to it, I had to study for the make up which was a few days after the exams got over. He patiently sat with me and taught me all the important concepts at a time when all his friends were celebrating the end of the exams! With a good ( and some times weird) sense of humor and great general knowledge, he is one happily proud bong! Cheers and best of luck for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suraj-r-pawar">Suraj R Pawar</a></p>
<p>If you want to know something about any of the better TV show or movies just talk to Sushan. This guy knows all about BBT, Supernatural, Community and God only knows how many other shows. Also, he can undeniably be called the "fact that makes you squirm" guy for all the trivia he knows about ...(i'd rather not think about it).
He is a true friend and a really fun guy to hang around with. I wish him the best of luck for any and all future endeavors.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/udit-dewan">Udit Dewan</a></p>
<p>Sushan is simply an amazing person. His sense of humor is a little skewed but his jokes have given me company and reason to smile during many boring lectures. His knowledge about sports and his talent for quizzing are worth mentioning. I wish he has a bright future. Keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>A wonderful person whom I have known since my school days. He is one of those naturally amiable and calm bongs who has an amazing thirst for knowledge. He can be unstoppable when he is cracking jokes from the joke book he used to circulate in our class in school..quite a book it was. He is also a fellow non-veg fan which he shares with me. The only thing wrong with him is he supports Man U. :P
You are extremlely good at heart and a wonderfurful person. Hope you do really well and scale great hieghts<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sourav-banerjee">Sourav Banerjee</a></p>

<p>Sushan is one of the most knowledegable people I have ever met. We have had countless conversations on a wide variety of topics and I have always ended up learning a lot. He really is like a walking, talking encyclopedia. _/\_ He has a great sense of humour with a very obvious dark side but when he's around, you can never get bored. He's a proper bong and a proper foodie. He is very talented and has a natural flair for computer stuff. The way he talks about things makes even the most complex subjects seem laughably simple. But most importantly, he is a wonderful person and a very dear friend. I will always remember the time when he literally carried me to the audi after I hurt my foot. Thanks a lot! It's been a pleasure knowing you and I wish you all the best for your future endeavours.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>A fellow believer in the United religion, Sushan is a hugely knowledgeable guy. Its been an absolute treat knowing this calm, composed Bengali chele. He was one of the first few true United fans i met on campus and remains part of that very small list. So here's hoping we can sit down and crack open a couple of beers sometime in the future and watch United kick some City ass!

<p>All hail the unanimous legend, the greatest king and the most beloved ruler of our sport, HRH Roger Federer! Only Sushan and I can say that with full conviction. This and our passion for quizzing is what drew us together and have led to some truly joyous moments. He is truly one of the best quizzers on our campus, knowledgeable on such a vast no. of topics - you can always rely on him to have read up on some topic or other! Oh and his outright politically incorrect jokes can quite easily crack you up! Best Wishes mate! Long Live Federer!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>Overlord- apt dc nick for you.This guy has mountains of knowledge,and his dark humour sense either provokes a devious smile or ROFL.Some call him a talking encyclopedia, not very inaccurate ,he is also a talking marathon.I cant help but recall your preachings that would start from casual hello at 10.30 pm to visual gruesome/goad picturisation and ensuing drama at 11.45 pm and by the time we had finished ridiculing every civilization with the atrocities they had performed, it would be 2am.This testimonial can't even begin to hold the discussion on masters of the seven sins.On Tv shows you are a savant, your advices rock: californication(:-*),white collar,hustle,leverage and half a dozen others has never disappointed.He is a bengali chele,the accent is not bengali though,but the wants,booze and women, that's all we want,rite? Mostly right but his stupid software crashed my laptop :-X.Nevertheless, he is a great freind,keep in touch and party your life out!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raunak-sharan">RAUNAK SHARAN</a></p>
