<p>Man !!! You've been the most influential person I've come across. In 1-1 I didn't even know who lives in Ah5 209. As time rolled by I got a better insight into you. Although i'm not a gr8 fan of football but still i enjoyed watching you teasing Mahi after beating him 3-0 in fifa 2010. Qualities like extremely down to earth nature , always willing to help irrespective of time and a great person to interact separates you from rest of the crowd.. Probably the only person i feel to have good Technical and Managerial skill set. 
You have the charisma that i wish to owe one day...
Always be the way you are and Have a great life ahead...Best of luck for future...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>
<p>1 Guy whom I can look upto and say, You were, are and will always be the best! :) 
Be it his down-to-earth nature, or the way he treats juniors, or his passion towards his interests, or the way he used to host DC, or his calm and cool looks, he has not left anything where any faults could be made out. All was perfect. And, +1 to the charisma wali baat of Mohit bhaiya. Have a wonderful life ahead, as I know you will. Don't forget this junior. ;) Stay in touch. :) Thanks for being there always. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavul-gauri">Bhavul Gauri</a></p>
<p>Known nowadays as the Godfather of our campus due to the fact that his mere support helped many guys to win this year's election. A very dedicated FIFA player who still has not given by on the franchisee in spite of no lan gaming. I think he is really good in the things he is interested in ( Wed development, Gaming, poilitcs, DC, chudaap) but sucks when comes to things like giving BIO assignments and labs. I literally shiver when I think of you in EEE with all the muggus next sem. A very dedicated Titan owner who released FIFA11 before his MuP exams. I think your legacy will live on. Thanks for being my friend and a very helpful guy

PS. Lets remember the good times :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>lone_rider aka Hendrix (by a few ) aka Swapnil Saurav (by i guess only 5-10 people) . For most people on campus "DC++ " may be just "a software" to download whatever thing the want, but for this guy it has been a journey , form being a no-one to being "the one" in campus. He has seen it all from being a normal admin to a host and then leaving his own hub, he has done it all.
Personally a very good friend , whom u can rely on any time , he wont even think twice before taking a bullet for his friends. I met in my 2-1 but got to know him properly only at end of 2-2 & 3-1 . We share a lot of memories form door to door campaigning to nc visits at 2 to ps at renusagar to bogmalo and yes now the night outs too  all have been awesome with you. I was angry when you dragged me to a night out a week before compree but now i feel it was one of the best thing that i had done on campus , planning for a nightout in 15 min is definitely the thing to do :D . 
People will tell you he is an excellent web developer but for that i have seen it myself. he knows how to get the things done i.e  A master of "Jgugaad"  . He is one person who can achieve any and i literally mean anything , there was a time when people in campus were running after foreign interns this guy fucking 3 paid confirmed foreign interns to choose from.
I like your attitude that makes you so special the "muzz ka d00d" so don't change it . Hope we remain in touch forever and have a \m/ friendship . Best of luck for future coz you need it BIO was easy but EEE will tell you what engineering is all about *evil laughter*<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ananya-singhal">Ananya Singhal</a></p>

<p>all the people who knw him in bits, call him "lone" but i call him swapnil (coz dat is wat his name is !!!). he becomes pro in everything he puts his hands on be it fifa,coding, web designing ,' politics ' , drinking and everything else.  He got selected in almost all the departments and clubs in 2nd yr and i ws like "wtf". if i owned a company I wud definitely hire some1 like him . his passion towards wat he wants , jolly,cool and friendly nature is really admirable . I 'll miss all the beach trips , bike rides , night outs and everything else I hv shared wid u . thanx a lot fr all the beautiful memories. u dont need good luck and u'll defintely make a lot of money and will go places . :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhinav-pathak">Abhinav Pathak</a></p>
