<h1 class="page-title">Swechha Prakash</h1><p>Swechha! you are one unique and dynamic person....you can be sweet, funny, cute, naughty, wild, bitchy, everything at the same time :P we go a long long looooooooong way back, right since 11th/12th but really, i couldnt have imagined college without u. BITS and life here would be TOTALLY different had you not been there. you always are that one friend i can fall back on at the end of the day. i remember watching movies together, our outings, u forcing me to watch friends and vampire diaries and those tp sessions where we would all do bak bak on absolutely nothing meaningful, all these more recent things as well as the good old times when we had sleepovers, going on long walks, u doing my workshop report diagrams, studying together, listening to good old linkin park and other silly songs, hanging out with u and rounak, silly chats, and all those small things. you are an amazing artist, whether u believe it or not, an avid reader, and u have a great capacity to watch series at a stretch :P so i have so many things to say but i dont know how to write them all in one testimonial. so i will keep telling u what i have to say as time goes a long, and that wont be a problem, im quite sure because we will definitely keep in touch and meet for sure in the future, even if it is to come kill each other for not keeping in touch ;) luv ya!

<p>I think this last one year we became like really good friends and I guess the fun we had together compensated for all those past years. When you talk to her you know for a fact that you are talking to a smart person. Many of us don't know this about her but with time I have realized that she is a freakishly OCD-ed , tech geek. I am so glad we were in the same group for assignments etc because they led to some amazing fun times. Those night outs and random gossip sessions, outings  hold some really interesting and fun memories. Apart from all this SWECHHA PRAKSH IS JUST SO CUTE! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Swechha is one of the most well mannered girls i know. She is very polite, cute, has a dressing sense that just suits her cute personality,and has a certain aura about her that you can confide to her even if you meet her after weeks or months. She must have the tidiest room in the hostel which shows her attachment with order and neatness.A girl of principles, she is simply adorable.Hope to meet you in future sometime! :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>
<p>You have OCD, and you're an undercover nerd. 
You're a Hindi genius, and yet when you speak in Hindi it's so weird.
Going by the rulebook of writing testimonials I guess I also have to mention the time we started talking, which was of course those CP1 labs with LC3, of which we both didn't know anything at all. Then there was also Quark, in which you totally cheated in that competition and won the first prize, which we should have won :/
The bitching sessions, eating maggi (getting appendicitis :P), hanging out in campus and in mumbai were and will be superphuntimes.
May our enthusiasm for Family guy stay the same foreva! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rounak-jain">Rounak Jain</a></p>

<p>All that people are saying above is poo. Don't believe them @melange. She's high all the time. If you knock on her door she says forbidden stuff. People say this is a story but I've seen her once killing a pigeon with bear hands. She threatens people for money also. Even Nirmala is scared of her.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
