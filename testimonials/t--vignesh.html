<p>He is Mr. Quintessential. Having spent 3 years with him, I'm glad I learned a lot from him and nurtured a friendship which I'm going to treasure for the rest of my life. A guy about whose talents everyone knows in campus, he is also very humble and helping in nature. When ever I was at a low, he would be there to pick me up and make my day. I wish we could stay in college and spend more time together but alas! it is time to move on. I wish him all the best in life and hope he gets all he wants in life. Viggy you are a true rockstar :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>I would count viggy as one of the most amazing people i have ever met. The true multitalented guy of 2009 batch and a cool company to hang out with too. He never feels shy to try out anything new and learn as much as he can(His corridor mates would understand this :P). I am sure i would always remember him from my college days. Viggy the Proo ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vaibhav-barthwal">Vaibhav Barthwal</a></p>
<p>The Multitalented guy of 2009 batch, this guy has been eager to participate in all possible things on campus.  An extremely open guy, he makes friends easily and you can never be bored hanging out with this guy. A true friend, he will always stand with you when the times are tough.
Perhaps the most hardworking guy I ever know, I will miss my very own Chiggy Hendrix and his musical skills :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rishabh-goel">Rishabh Goel</a></p>
<p>The most enthusiastic person I've ever met. Hands Down. Viggy is a man of many talents. He knows how to play the violin and the flute. He is a self taught guitar player too. Apart from music, this guy knows more languages than the average UN delegate. Passionate about conserving energy too. Astronomy freak. He certainly can take a joke. Good Company. Laughs at himself. Enjoy Vigster !

PS: He loves skating

<p>Viggy....from celestia to urja to the 3rd face of zephyr, u have done it all and how!!!! You truly define a multi-talented person. The one thing I admire about you the most is your ability to keep trying different things and to never give up (even though I would have made fun of this sometimes :P) I am sure your multilingual ability will surely help you a lot in your future endeavors. Just one advice I would give you - Don't allow others to make fun of you and you will go a long way in life!!!! All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Well, our very own viggy. What to say about him. Looking at him will always make you wonder, how can someone be soooo talented. Someone with so many skills to boast about and yet so humble and down to earth with such a sense of composure. Well, you don't find many people like that, do you? With all the time I have known him, he is just great. To have him as the sub coordinator of Celestia was always a comforting feeling. There is no doubt about your abilities mate, the only question about what are you gonna achieve is what you decide to achieve. You have a long way to go and great heights to scale, all the best for the journey :) God bless!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>Vignesh, the guy with a limb in every sphere of life imaginable. This guy has really "been there, done that". One thing I appreciate about him is his ability to face criticism and still be headstrong and go about his business as usual. A really humble, innocent and simple person who is always ready with advice and help for everyone. Writing about the innumerable skills that he possesses would be a waste of white-space, the immensely multi-talented that he is!! He sure has a long way to go in life and may he achieve all that he desires. It was a pleasure knowing you pal. Stay in touch. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>One of the most authentic persons I met on campus. Viggy you rock ! You will never see him uttering any harsh word to any person. His way of appreciation is so subtle and endearing to anyone who listens it. He is a person who is passionate about astronomy . As a Subcoordi of Celestia he has motivated many juniors with his knowledge filled words time to time. I hope you will decipher how the Human Brain functions in near future .. All the best to you :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gayathry-dasika">Gayathry Dasika</a></p>
<p>Viggy! He's one of those eccentric types. Loves complicated things. Neural networks, Chaos Theory, Astrophysics, Chaos Theory, Non-linear dynamics. The harder to pronounce, the more excited he becomes. I admire his passion to learn new things. Another thing - Viggy is always nice. Always. It can get unnerving. I half-expect Satan to one day emerge out of him to compensate for that. Then there's the music. Pretty much an expert in the guitar, violin and soon, the triangle. He's always searching for something to master. Keep it going man, and good luck for your future endeavors.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saksham-bhatla">Saksham Bhatla</a></p>
<p>Vignesh or probably more popular as Viggy, you're a great package. A mulch-talented personality. I seen you working your asses out with quark in your 1st year, running 2 round of the campus daily, working effortlessly for urja, Playing guitar, doing pushups using just 2 fingers. The kind of cheap n lame jokes i crack are always meant for fun. I never meant to hurt you. If i achieve even half of the talent you have I'll consider that i've done well with my life... Thanks man for all the sexy memories we had during E-Mech labs, after exams the common expression "yaar ch@!# gya yaar". Love you man,.. Have a great life, always keep smiling like the way you've done till now... Best of luck for all your future endeavors... <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-yadav">Mohit Yadav</a></p>

<p>Amazing guy<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
<p>It is very difficult for me to contemplate about something which Vignesh can't do.  Won't elaborate much on that seeing the other testimonials. He has the perfect blend of optimism and realism which i envy him for. If you are working on anything with Vignesh, you tend to be unperturbed coz if he's there everything will go on smoothly. Never felt that he is my senior due to his genuine humility. May you be successful in all your future endeavours.

<p>(Multi)Talented!! if you ask me summarize this stud of Ah4. Viggy, Viggster, Viggy Hendrix are some of the names by which his fans call him. A very down to earth person, I have shared many a laugh with him. He's a great friend, Super hardworking, I have seen him working untiringly for Urja and when he would come back at night i would inevitably hear him practicing on his flute. Flute , violin , guitar, pushups on fingers /\, this guy has done it all. I have had some memorable times with you, All the best for the future. Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>viggy, u have been a great friend to me through out my college lyf. the endless discussions we had standing/sitting on the stairs were worth cherishing. i always found u as an inquisitive and curious person, ur thirst for knowledge amazes me . u have that "we have to change this" vibe which brought us much closer.  we have a lot in common but i think i could have known u much better and hung out with u more often. well , i would surely miss the genuine smile with a ssup?? ,  nevertheless i sincerely wish u ENJOY wateva u do and wherever u go .well, keep in touch . :) :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sribhashyam-saisriram">Sribhashyam saisriram</a></p>
<p>Viggy!! Everybody loves viggy. Why wouldnt they? He is innocent, gentle, very good at heart, and extremely nice to everyone! Calling him multi talented would be an understatement. you name any thing and he has either mastered that, or its in his bucket list. Extremely hard working and passionate, which is apparent from the number of clubs in the campus that he is a part of. Keep this good spirit up buddy, and best of luck for your future :)
P.S.- That earlier testi was written by some1 else, playing a prank on you.. delete that if you want to :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ahut-gupta">Ahut Gupta</a></p>
<p>Viggy..... a knowledgeable person... knows many languages, lot about electronics and has got other talents like playing guitar and flute. A workaholic who is part of many clubs and departments on campus. Very popular among friends, everyone enjoys his company, extremely helpful. Hours pass as we stand next to the hostel entrance talking. A very organized person who does not find it difficult to wake up early in the morning and run three rounds around the campus. It was a pleasure to know him. Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Viggy....or Mr.Vig (which is what i m calling him recently)...is one of the most enthusiastic, talented and famous guys i've met on campus.  I am not mentioning his endless list of talents another time (coz others have already done that), but one very important quality that he has ( and i think nobody else does) is, he never hesitates to try out something new, no matter what ppl will say about it. that's a very great quality that one must posses.!! be it urja, or tedx or celestia, viggy has given his dedication and hard-work wherever he went and made it successful. In spite of all this, he manages to remain cool and friendly with all.  he is probably the only guy i've seen in these 3 years who is unaffected as to what ppl say about his likes and dislikes. he is very determined &  doesnt let those "street-side comments" affect his work. Keep it up!! Viggy is also known for his extreme interest in various mind twisting electives and topics like String theory, Non Linear Dynamics, Nano-tech (which he is currently fodufying O.o), Astronomy etc... He is also a very good runner (probably better than amit kabi as well  :P ) , example of that are his daily jogging trips at 6am in the morning since 1st year. inspite of all this, Viggy has given me company in being a 6 pointer during the harsh-full days of EEE CDCs :P (thank u so much for that  :D)  No doubt, u will excel in ur life.....wishing u best of luck  Ustaad Viggy Hendrix  !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mihir-karkhane">Mihir Karkhane</a></p>
<p>Well to start with, I met Vignesh bhaiya in December 2011 for Quark event(Sustain-a-Build) which he was managing. It was a great experience working under him. He is a nice person, cool, calm and patient. He is one of few ppl in campus whom i feel i can contact any time!!

Wish you all luck and success in life!!

<p>The man to be FEARED! And I say that with a hint of innuendo :D
Yes O yes! The TRW days! And why, many many more.
You were the first guy I spoke to properly on campus, and me, given the introvert that I was back then, it’s one hell of a compliment believe me. Vignesh comes, unleashes his fun-loving charisma and in minutes you are in awe of this guy. In three years, no matter what the EEE/ENI departments threw at us, not once I heard him cribbing over anything. Vignesh says never say die and if that does not work he says lite lo yaar. He doesn’t crib or rant, nope, not his style :D  How many days have we not spent making fun of our miseries? How many FEARSOME PJs? More talented than I can describe here, Vignesh sure has an array of hobbies and he rocks each one of them.  I have had the rare privilege of being his poetry-critic. His words simple and ideas profound, it a talent only very truly heartfelt emotions can bring forth.  Hes a Tennyson in the making :D
We aren’t parting ways yet, theres another semester another bunch of epic dinners with you :D. all the best for your future!
