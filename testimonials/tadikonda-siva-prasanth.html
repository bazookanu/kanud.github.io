<h1 class="page-title">tadikonda siva prasanth</h1><p>Tadi, as everyone calls him, is one of my best friends and is the most fun loving and lazy person I've ever met. He is always hungry and cheerful. He is very much dedicated to TV series, one can always find him viewing the same episodes often. Does not take exams seriously, he views a movie or an episode before going for an exam. A very sincere and enthusiastic guy, pursues his interest very seriously. He does everything he can to make friends happy. Wish you all the best for your future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankeerth">Sankeerth</a></p>

<p>Prasanth(Tadi) is probably one of the very few people in BITS who come to my room for purposes not related to studies.(His purposes often including eating, looking for something to eat or simply time-passing ) . He was one of my first study-partners , the cause of our friendship being Prob&Stat. His personality  '  defines the word 'LITE' perfectly. I will always remember my efforts to force him to go classes , though with little success. My  movie guide, and one of the most coolest person i have ever met. Will miss you............      <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijat-chowdhary">Abhijat Chowdhary</a></p>
