<p>Ahh Tanmay  or Tanny boy as I call is one of the closest friends I have made on campus. Though officially his hostel is AH 5, but he always has been found to be hanging out in AH 4, be it with Aruj, Ahut and others in the first sem, or how much ever time he was on campus that sem, or my, ashesh or puneet's room in second and third year. He was one of the jaundice survivors and one who got worst hit by it, he had to miss his first sem because of it and now that he is a duallite he will graduate with 2011 batch. (poor fella :P). But he is one good designer and was one of the most pressurized person in all the festival Co-Cos, none the less as the first Chief Designer of Dept. of Creative Media he did a good job. A very hard working and sincere down to earth guy, you will be missed once we are out of here. Keep in touch and wish you a happy, healthy and prosperous life.

<p>Tanny Boy!! I'm gonna keep this short. This is one simple, friendly guy who's been one of my best friends on campus for the past couple of years now. A guy with a passion for digital design and one who's extremely skilled at it too. Also, one person who's taken all kinds of crap from me and still understood me well enough stay put and hang in there. Life hasn't really been fair to him, first with AH5 (:P) and then jaundice, causing him to lose an entire academic year, but he has managed to take it well and make the best of the situation. Here's one guy I can be totally frank with, and trust him to either totally not care of completely understand. And since I share that kind of a rapport with him, there's isn't much I can write here in addition to what I can say to his face. I'm pretty damn sure we're not losing touch for a long, long time, so here's to the many more years of friendship to come! Cheers! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ashesh-kaushik">Ashesh Kaushik</a></p>

<p>I don’t remember when I met Tanmay first. But I remember talking to him for the first time in the bus (when he was kind enough to give me a window seat :P ) while going home for the jaundice break (which unfortunately has made his BITS life way too long) Came to know him better during the practice sessions for Ganesh chaturthi performance in 2-1. He is a pro in Photoshop, After effects and related stuff... A good sketcher too.. Very frank person.. He can say ‘no’ to anyone if he doesn’t want to do something... I really admire that.. He is a crazy F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan.. Has every dialogue on the tip of his tongue.. Can enact it really well.. Used to enact Barney too... According to him, saying no to chocolate is sheer disrespect.. ‘Never say no to chocolates!’ I will remember that everytime while denying a chocolate offered :P All the best for your life ahead.. May you have a pleasant stay in campus even after we are gone! (feel sad for you, but it’s fun to tease ;) )<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Tanny - The one guy whom I love making fun of! and the one guy who doesnt even try to retaliate. The man from Pune is a persona of solemn attitude. The only guy from Pune in this whole Freaking world - who is actually proud of hailing from Pune. :P
I remember his long hair I always venerated. His Photoshop & Adobe Suite skills are obviously unparalleled. 
Dude, it was really a lot of fun for me making fun of you as it was fun making fun, but I wish you the best for your future & I hope you fulfill all your dreams in your life - Dreamworks!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Tanny bouy ! One of those first friends I made on campus, a fellow Maths buddy ( now junior ). This kid is smart but idiot at the same time, wont ever give up a debate irrespective of whether he is wrong or right. My best academic sem 1-1 was all due to him, he took me to classes sat with me and made me study, that stupid Jaundice is solely responsible for my poor academic record. Always stays in AH4, these days atleast he knows people in AH5. A fun guy to hang with, loves designs and I hope he ends up well as a Designer in future. He learns fast, implements and executes perfectly. His contribution to campus fests is remarkable, to work with small team teach juniors and come up with awesome work is truly brilliant. 
I had awesome moments with you, thanks for the help !
I hope you have a bright future, achieve your dreams and be the perfect BITSian :P (Godfather)

PS. Next sem kick my ass and send me to classes please
