<h1 class="page-title">Tanmaya Sanghvi</h1><p>Before we met through professional channels and then slowly became good friends , "haughty" was the word that I used to summarize you with but now that I know you better, 
hardworking,sincere, pretty and nice are the words that crop up when I think of you.It was indeed a pleasure to work with you and then to subsequently be your friend .You are one of the few girls in this college who is not obsessed with herself and I admire you a lot for that.Always stay the way you are and I am sure you will go very far in life.(especially with your restaurant plans ).All the best for your life ahead......!!!!
PS:Despite the delay i am still the first one to write about you ........:P!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-choudhury">Rahul Choudhury</a></p>
<p>Tanmaya Sanghavi is a nice person. She is intelligent and smart. I wish her a great and successful future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Ok, so where do I even begin! I could list all her achievements but I believe these text boxes cannot withstand so much awesomeness! It is possible, however, to describe how she blazes away to the top of each course leaving behind stunned admirers, all this while having all the fun you can have being in college. Some years down the line she is possibly going to be famous as one of the following: Economist, Programmer, Designer, Financial Manager, Personnel Manager, Event Manager, Environmental Activist, Super Model or Food critic...Or all of them!
Get her autograph now!
Best wishes Tanmaya! And here's to the restaurant we may co-own!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-ramani">Aditya Ramani</a></p>
<p>We should so totally have won the award for the best jodi!! i mean no one else has been together for as long as we have...16 years!!! All the fun times in school, when you sat in front of me and we made our project on "Festivals", when we were partners in the Hat dance and you were my guy ;) and you kept screaming at me for biting my nails!, who thought back then that we would be together again after all these years! And closer than we've ever been.  All the times we would fall asleep in your room, every movie that you've slept through! all the times we've taken gau's case, all the late night gossips, all the trying on of clothes for hours before choosing what to wear, all the times before physics 1 paper when we went for walks in the rain singing school hymns. My college life would have been incomplete without you! I hope later in life we end up in the same company or city atleast and continue this long journey we started together when we were 4 :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Tanmaya ...  a pretentious matlabi arrogant self important little nerd. Ok that is pushing, it but you get the picture, or so I though, cause quite frankly I met her but briefly early on and only interacted with her sometime later then most of he other people I know, Perhaps it was 1-2 ???  I really couldn't but be wrong to say the least. So lets revisit the list. No not too pretentious, cause she does actually end up doing all she says , trust me that is a shit load above the average joe and yes with the same enthu and vigour every single time ! The next two words are plain me being a prick , she is quite the opposite, actually extremely helpful and cheerful ( Is this the bhoj that I owe some awesome treks to her weighing down here ?? ). Great fun to hang out with , one of the beloved bogamalo pack :P , loves experimenting, partying and is a wonderful friend. Yes i also owe you one for the bogamalo debacle, thanks for standing by and being a great friend (and getting me through the gate too :D ) .The last bit I retain, 'class A' Bookworm and Nerd , and hell yeah, she's actually proud of it and I respect that . KUDOS. She knows her direction and strives to achieve it and am quite certain she will end up successful and famous. It's been great fun to have known and spent time with you , wish you luck. You  BETTER stay in touch. Cheers !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhananjay-deepak-sathe">Dhananjay Deepak Sathe</a></p>
<p>Atlast here is the testimonial for one of the best people I met in BITS Goa .. Knew her only as a girl who earned a perfect 10 in one of the semesters.. truly I was a bit intimidated and even scared about my PS-1 grade when I came to know that she's in my PS Station... reality turned out to be quite different.. I must say, she's a real intelligent, hardworking, sincere, determined girl. One thing I appreciate the most about her is that she doesn't think twice before voicing her opinions....and she doesn't mind going out of her way to help you out... I would never forget the awesome fun we had in our little office called "Nalanda" .. the times we spent discussing every facet of our BITS life, cursing the company and finally coding away together and those high-fives when we solved a certain problem.. I would always remember and cherish them... She's a wonderful person to hangout with.. a total party girl once she is set free from the burden of acads and a socialite to the core ! If you want to make plans involving her.. you need to make them weeks in advance ! She's an environmentalist and assured of a very successful future as an economist ..  I hope our little plans of starting restaurant review website falls into place .. and yeah.. she's great bartender too :D All in all.. one of my best buddies here..  It's been one hell of a journey with you till now.. And I wish you luck for the future... Hope we always stay in touch....Here's three cheers to one of my best friends !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/harshal-chaudhari">Harshal Chaudhari</a></p>

<p>Make a list of all tings to be done in college life and I think Tanmaya would easily manage to check all boxes. Mention a thing and with her, it's like "Been there, done that". The first girl coordinator of DOFAM, we both got to know each other whilst working for Quark'12. I cannot imagine that festival without her. She was probably the reason why I managed to retain my sanity during that maniacal festival. Her efficacy at getting things done was so good that I would just mention a problem to her and forget about it and she would get it done or have a solution within no time at all. Very quick witted she has an answer to everything and was a constant support to me all throughout and we had some very memorable moments while working together (be it lamenting the sad economic state of the fest or calling a few people awful names. I think you know who :P) . I may have been quaint and irrational at times and I would like to thank her for bearing with me during all my mood swings and whims. One of the brightest girls I have known with a sound sense of adjudication, she has an exceptionally high presence of mind and couple that with her awesome public relation skills, you have a perfect manager at hand. She is the one person who can mingle with almost everyone and mind you, being Assets coordinator of Quark very much requires the skill of knowing what to say and when to say, of which she has no dearth. Her daunting academic record speaks volumes about her ability to stay focussed whilst being versatile at the same time. Wish her all the very best and I know for sure that she is definitely going places!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
