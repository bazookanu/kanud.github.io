<h1 class="page-title">Tapsi Dubey</h1><p>You were my first friend on campus. It was one hell of a first sem! Though we are not as close as we used to be, i wanted to let you know that i'll always cherish the time we shared. I can never forget the bubbly over-emotional Taxi :) Keep smiling and rock-on \m/<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kriti-garuda">Kriti Garuda</a></p>
<p>I think i realised Tapsi's presence in 1-2. Before that, i hardly saw her and talking to her was a distant thing :P After that, we started talking and I realised what a truly amazing person she is. She is so understanding that she'll just guess whats going on inside your head without you uttering a word. Eventually we became so close that even though we dont see each other or talk to each other for days, when we do meet we make upto all the lost time. I can tell her almost  everything and she understands me better than anyone else. She knows me so well that sometimes i am shocked that how can  she know me more than myself :O:P Even though there were sumtimes, i was not present or you were not with me, but both of us know that we are always there for each other. I can go to her anytym with any problem that i have n she counsels me and has greatly helped me in taking so many decisions. She always sees the larger picture which i love about her and is always positive in every situation. She handles everything with such calmness and care, that she truly inspires me. You have always been there for me, guided me and supported me. N even though you forget my bday eveytime, i still love reminding you later and then cursing you for forgetting it. Please carry on this trend. I'm loving it ;):D:D I am going to miss you sooo much and I am sure that you'll excel in whatever you do in life. All the very best to you and may all you wishes come true. Always remain the same and keep smiling. :):*<3<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishita-gupta">Ishita Gupta</a></p>

<p>Tapsi Dubey or tappiiiiiii as i call her, is more than a friend to me, she is my sister, my senior.. yeah..!! and someone to whom i can say anything anytime however stupid or complex or even pathetic it may be... Though we met just two years back but still it feels like i've known her forever... We've been a part of so many special and not-so-special moments of one another that its impossible for me to pick the best one's - the sunday 11 o'clock breakfasts, chai n muffin/donut at monginis, the parlour trips, prom shopping, dj nights, shopping at appolo in indore, endless chats and gossips in room no 344 (both ch4 and ch5.. :P) are some of our memories i can never ever leave.. and somehow i think these moments would never have even mattered had she not been there..!! it was her presence that made these small events so memorable and I can say that nothing in which the two of us were together was ever less than fun!! :) Sure we had our share of fights and differences but they were never enough to pull us back somehow we always managed to get past them all that was needed was a few tears and hugs..!! :) So, this is for her to know that I am sooo lucky, to have a friend like her in my life, who knows all my qualities and faults better than myself.. :) She is the most passionate person i've known and is always the best at whatever she does let it be basketball, acads, mischief..!! yeah she is a true prankster at heart..!! The extent to which she can care for people she loves still amazes me... Her strength to take the tough road and still do the best sets her apart from the rest. Once she decides for something and the people she care about support her, she can fight all odds and be the winner..!! I have learned so much from her and seen so much with her that it is impossible to say a good bye and hence I never will..!! :) so this to you tappiiii, as you leave this campus to start a new venture of your life, just believe in yourself as you always do, take care and just remember that i love you soooo much that no physical distance can ever be a hindrance in the bond we share..!! mwahh..!!! I promise whenever u need me i'll be just a call away ready to unburden you with anything that you are holding on to... so just njoy.. live the life you have always dreamt of with the people you love and don’t forget to miss me… :P  mwahhh..!!!! :) - nidhiiiiii<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nidhi-kothari">Nidhi Kothari</a></p>

<p>Hmmm,I think u my the best decision in life. It has been really an awesome journey wherein u taught me how sometimes u need to face things rather than ignoring, which i always thought was the easy way out.I will miss our bits life. It had its phases but thats what made it amazing.I adore u for the way u do things in life and im trying to develop that attitude. Your dedication is the key to your success , so keep it up. I will always be there for you and together well scale new heights. All the best. I will make sure that all is best :D

<p>Tapsiii!!!.. (n u knw wat else   ) I first met her as an amazing athlete and enjoyed playing basketball and laughing till we nearly cried on court (remember the shooting practice with new nets .. epic tha woh toh ..   ) with her in first year before she got all nerdy and started making library her home  I know her to be very jovial, fun and still very hardworking, sincere in her work, n you can always find her at mongi !!  You never get bored with her..she is always ready for masti, however crazy! Numal classes wouldn’t have been the same without you.. all the laughing, incessant talking, commenting, and what not!!.. (m still surprised that we weren’t asked to leave in any one of them!!.. even in Dhano’s class for that matter! ) will miss you.. wish you all the best for your future!!.. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/disha-pramod-gujar">Disha Pramod Gujar</a></p>

<p>"Yo man!" and a wide smile is what I remember first about tapsi... We had a lot in common since 1st year.. Aero, basketball and ofcourse chemical... Its been great time with you.. calling u by all sorts of name (which i m not making public, for you ;) ) and that dream ( :D :P) is surely memorable! Tapsi is a very determined girl.. I still wonder how she managed to shoot up her CG after 1st year.. But now she is a chemical fodu.. She cannot survive without tea... Goes to almost every class with tea in her hand.. and most of the times last person to enter the class (consistently 15 min late :P)  Will definitely miss your presence next sem.. May you achieve all that you want.. All the best for your life ahead, 'tap'si..!! ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Tapsi is one of the most amazing people  I know in campus. She always has a smile on her face and does not take tension for anything and still manages  everything so perfectly!...hearing her name, “yo man” is the first thing that comes to my mind.. Let it be academics, playing basketball or being a good friend..she excels in every area!!   OB would never have been same without you. Be it our tea and coffee breaks (your tea and mine coffee vala break :P ;) )and getting late for the next class ( lol tha vo to :P)  or group assignments which we always started late and for which we stayed up till 4 in the morning..had a wonderful time together! The greatest quality that she posses is her determination and I really admire that.I am sure everyone who knows her will agree to it  :)......The way she has pulled up her cg with constant effort and hard work is commendable. She is person who can manage academics along with her share of fun. A very humble and down to earth person who aces all the subjects she studies! I will miss you a lot!! Your hard work and determination, along with the awesome nature you have, will help you to be very successful in life. All the best! Stay in touch! And stay the same!! ?  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/megha-sharma">Megha Sharma</a></p>
