<p>This girl can laugh. I am mentioning this specially because when she starts, it has no end. An amazing classical dancer(still remember Waves'09 performance). She is a really intelligent and hard working person. Our common interest in food has led to some great times. She can be just so smart at times and cutely stupid at another. She is one of the rare multi talented person we've. I wish you all the best and yeah keep laughing.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>
<p>Tara Ramanan! The most amazing thing about you is that no matter how much we fight, you still remain, and always will be, my best friend! Its always so much fun to have you around. Being here in BITS without you would have been so dull and I'm so thankful that I met you back in 2007. I sometimes wonder how can someone be as talented as you are! Brilliant dancer, an awesome poet, singer, pretty, funny, and I can really keep going on! When I look back, I'll always remember you in one of your laughing fits, going on and on with your "what-if" questions. And not that it was required to mention, no matter what, I simply know we'll always be in touch.
Loads of love!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/swechha-prakash">Swechha Prakash</a></p>
<p>Tara!!! :D you are one of the most influential persons i have met in my life and a great friend. I can truly say that i started liking my college life in 2nd year when i got you as a friend.2-1 will always be memorable for me. You are really smart, funny , helping and a real good person at heart. Apart from that you are a truly versatile dancer, a great poet and have a knack for laughing continuously and making others laugh :P I shall always miss our discussions on various topics, common dance practices in audi , and our night canteen visits and our common genuine interest in food :P ( yes! after all this time you are now my food buddy also :D) Thanks for being there for me always! Stay in touch! love you a lot! :-) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>

<p>I bet we both can go neck & neck in a competition titled "who irritates the other one the most"
I'm amazed by how you can write poems that I can understand, and also how much you can lie when it comes to your marks! (you agree right? :P)
I've enjoyed every bit of all the arguments and the teasing sessions, and of course hanging out.
Here's to the awesome times making fun of swechha's weird pronunciations :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rounak-jain">Rounak Jain</a></p>
<p>An amazing dancer, headstrong and great hair - the first thoughts when I think about Tara... She helped me out of some really tight spots. One can always talk to her even if they dont feel like talking at all.. And, without a doubt,  they'll come out feeling much better. Keep smiling spacebug! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshat-tiwari">Akshat Tiwari</a></p>
<p>She may be talented, may be not, she may be a nerd, may be not, but she is very good at laughing!! U just can't resist laughing if you see her laughing. I still can't understand y she laughs at a "designer hat", but she does. Dude if you invite me to your wedding, you surely getting designer hats as gift!! 

She is a fun loving person, always smiling and very sweet. She is good at dancing, but her best performance was "holika" dance :P. She was so horrifying!! She speaks too fast n i still remember, one guy came up to me after i had a chat with her in the corridor, "Can you understand her? She speaks so fast!! " 

Always keep on pinging me on gtalk!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-rupani">Rahul Rupani</a></p>
<p>Tara is one of the most intelligent girls on campus i know. Powered by an abundant vocabulary this girl can enrich any conversation by her diction. Besides being able to write awesome poetry, she knew all the country capitals and the capitals of all the states of the united states!!! Though others used to brilliantly lack enthusiasm, I will always remember how we used try to convince them during dance club trips and outings to play ATLAS and other such word games, She is one girl for whom I have the utmost respect and awe in the club.  So to sum up... All the Budapest!!! (your turn :P)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuraag-ramesh">Anuraag Ramesh</a></p>
<p>This girl can talk, and talk, endlessly. And even after you tell her she talks a lot, she wont care and still go on talking. That's one of the cutest things about her! And then she talks fast, like really fast, you need to struggle to understand what she's saying. I've always seen a smile on her face. She's a brilliant dancer with out of the world expressions! We got to know each other only in 3-2, but its been a fun semester. You going on about how you're scared of Garima, and the topic of being fat always coming up when Richa was around! :D You write such beautiful poetry! I wanna read more of it!! Keep in touch Tara, i'll miss you and your laughter :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nikita-gulati">Nikita Gulati</a></p>
<p>Taraaaaa!! You are an amaaaaaazing dancer and a very fun person! I love it when you laugh (a looooot) on little things and make it funnier than it actually is.. You are really helpful. I love the way you get confused and make situations fun! I am really happy that we met at vidyarthi and could make it to bits together.. It was awesome knowing you and i hope we always stay in touch! Keep laughing and spreading smiles.. :) (PS: Dont ever stop writing poems.. You are awesome at that! ) Take care.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/avni-goyal">Avni Goyal</a></p>
<p>If you don't win the "Best Expressions on Stage" award in future, people should stop acting! Seriously, I think Holika was the performance of your life because I have never seen anyone give radical expressions like that ever on stage! And your poems are really a treat to the mind to read them! I can't really believe a person so good at literary skills can also be really good at programming too. I hope you suceed in whatever field you wanna take up in life and set a mark in it. Stay cool. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shatyajeet-parida">Shatyajeet Parida</a></p>

I'm sure ill never invite you to my room!!!! You have a great sense of humor, intelligence and a very infectious laughter!!! You are one of my favorite persons here!!! ( i love your choice in songs and your beautiful poems! please do keep mailing them to me!!!)  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yashu">Yashu</a></p>
