<p>I really don’t know him  very much until the end PS 1  . after  PS1 i don’t  know what the heaven  happened  (yess .. i  mean it :P ) exactly he changed very  much. He suddenly  started participating in all our parties with full energy and his presence really made a difference and became a  very good friend to me after that .  He is very talented in doing all the stuff related computers and softwares. he is very good at hiding secretes which is a great quality for me ( because i’m pretty bad at that :P ) . he is a very good thinker and highly matured person . the way he thinks about the things makes him unique from others. Fun loving guy . great taste in music ,a big big fan of  “TOOL” band .very good learner , he always finds timeto learn newthings. coming to bogmalo we 2 started at the same tym going to bogmalo  (other 3 ppl are just earlier than us :P ) we had really great time over there those things made us very close friends from good friends. Don’t go for shopping with him he will never stop (keep on buying until all the money get over :P ).if u come across a situation what to do what not to do believe me  take his advice and simply follow u will surely end up with right thing (im damn sure about that :)  ).  A good leader too ,spree is an best example  (finance co-ordi ) he brought profits out of nothing  _/\_.all those walks around the campus after  the mess can’t be forgettable .the  common thing i personally feel between us is u allow the “CHANGE “same like me  . next semester without u  its really hard for us  . how can i describe 3 years life in 1 web page so i will stop here ...
Im really proud that ur my friend  .....miss u tarun  :( . i hope u will achieve great heights in life :)

<p>Hmm.....Tarun Gupta.....this name rings a bell for those energized bunnies those who always party around. He is great with various mood swings ( mostly kameenapanti ). My dearest komti, who though sarcastic for the moment always encourages anything u do. Never ever ever ever go by his innocent looks and also watch out for his sarcasm. He reminds me of Chandler Bing but in a dominant way, though this little rascal is unique in his own way. He is a great fan of Vijay Mallya or rather we can say of his contributions to the society( if u know what i mean ;)........) I met him in 1-1 as an innocent bystander for whatever we did....but little did we know that he is a little devil out there. Apart from these he is a very good self claiming leader for his contributions to spree. Enough said.....though his biography can go on and on. And BTW he is the most hyperactive and fun loving guy I've ever known....Adios my dear amigo....Bon Voyage for the rest of the journey of your life..........:)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/j-harish">J Harish</a></p>
<p>.........some of the  life long  friendships are formed  during  boozing and the best ex to this is our frndship :P...AKKIRALA TARUN GUPTA  aka love guru is one my bestttttttt frnds.......looks calm , cool,decent.........but very few ppl  know  wat is he frm inside...and i feel proud to think that I am one of them...(real characters come out wen ur high is at peaks :P)  .  He is very good thinker and highly matured person ( u should write a book abt problems in general life like I.E IRODOVS probs in phy). .......for   many he may be the most energised bunny who always party around but for me he is a very sensitive person  who values friendship and will always be ready to help u with all his experiences..thanx for  the philosophical talk we had on the last day of 3-1..i learnt a lot frm that and that was the day..... “I  have seen  a different tarun”. I don’t know wat ppl see in him but i  see a rockstar in him (jiske andar dard hai :P).  An ardent  telangana fan and diff breed of komti ...:P...and most imp. ..thanx for ur encouragement and support on april 20th which iam never gng to forget in my life..:)  . truely dude u have taught me a lot . my campus life wouldn’t have been so adventourous and interesting without u....   .   I can  never  forget  all those bogmalo parties, bike rides,booze parties in room. And i will always remember these 3 yrs as happiest years of my life and it woudnt have been possible without u....   . Mature..... sensitive....handsome......thats tarun for me.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/a-venkateshwar-reddy">A VENKATESHWAR REDDY</a></p>
<p>TARUN......my boy!!!
you gave me an illusion created by euphemistic beauty and clustered crap of dizzy surroundings that don't seem to matter a lot but can always fill with red sand trust of rag doll hope.
That was just one of the many thought provoking CONCEPTS i learned from spending some unforgettable nights with him!!
Yeah! What all things didn't we do together?!
dancing  like  maniacs on the road near CH1,taking a puff on the benches behind AH6,the crazy spanking,romancing,fighting in my room,the never ending ayurvedic auto-laughter medicine,helping out each other from injuring themselves on those special saturday nights,our very own OMFA,a evening to remember in panji,the mind boggling late night..no early morning talks we had......oh my god it was one hell of a \m/ experience being with you! 8)
energetic,witty,sarcastic,funny,motivating,cool,calm,sincere,loving,caring,........new words have to be created to describe the countless traits this person carries!
He may not be able to tell u what u need to do,but he can definitely tell u what not to do!Yeah this one is a life saver.
seems to be a bit passive on first look...but just go and talk with him...he just keeps rolling....and by the way he can beat the crap out any person..he may not be always right but it is next to impossible to debate with him.
I should say i am very lucky and privileged that you've been a part of my life.
WOW is one word all that i say when u come to my mind!!

<p>Tarun...... finally here's one for u buddy... A very different person i have seen in this college, never used to mingle till the end of 2nd year... dunno wht happened suddenly after PS-1 :P he started hanging out with people around... A very sensitive, stubborn, humorous personality. He is a closed book actually, u make him drink, get him intoxicated in any way u wont get the true fact from him. :P A awesome personality to work with though... he is one of the guys who hasnt spoken to gals in his life till date... ( i dunno how it is possible :P) . obviously i ll be missing u buddy.. the convo's we had... the dance(in ash's room) :P, the classroom sittin...... finally wanna say gonna miss u :( :( :(, love u :* :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koushal-gada">KOUSHAL GADA</a></p>
<p>My first meeting with Tarun presented him as a soft, reticent sort of a guy but as they say "one should not judge a book by its cover", I was mistaken. One of the great finds of DOFAM, he stood up to his post of Finance Coordinator of SPREE and did a marvellous job and left behind shoes that will be difficult to fill. A very good friend who will win you over by his soft-spoken nature and his ability to silently bear through all the random crap you have to say. He is I must say one of the few Telugu friends I made here at BITS and he is one who really knows how to convince people and make friends easily. I will always miss the fun that we had while working for DOFAM all throughout our 3rd yr specially whilst fooling around during WAVES and pulling Subba's leg. Also I will remember those lame poor jokes that he cracked and I would still laugh at their timing. He is a good guy with a bright future. May he achieve all that he wishes in life. All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>I guess i shud start with....Dude!! No clue when we actually met, bt im glad we did...

Had a great time with u in past 1 yr.. regretting nw y the hell i didnt get closer to
u a bit earlier, cud hav had more fun :D..... I will surely miss the days we were high, listening to TOOL, Headbang like mad ppl to "THE POT"

I still remember the jokes we cracked on gawas just before SE exam during T2. 
Oh frgt to tell, he stuides a lot too and DOFAM god #not important at all

<p>Hi Tarun the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of you is your fun loving nature. You are very energetic and always want to do something new, different , interesting and of course funny. Tarun has a unique style in everything he does ,  good and mature sense of music(great fan of the band “tool”).  Before third year Tarun to me was just a guy from my hostel , don’t know what magic happened with him after PS1 there was a lot of change in him and eventually we became good friends in third year. We did a lot of pretty cool stuff together remember those five days at the end of 3-1  cooking maggi , getting bored of eating maggi roaming around the campus in search of food other than maggi . How can I forget new year  , remember the way you took permission speaking like your dad with Halan Prakash , celebrating new year on not one but three beaches , I can never forget the topics that we spoke on that day. One of the most interesting quality of you is you love to learn, try new things and do them in a unique(very) fashion . Coming to the pranks that you play I should say Dude seriously you have a strange sense of humor and I like it. The black magic prank on Ashwin that we played together (remember it was me who gave you the detergent) , the SUIT prank that you played on Harish which even involved the  hostel warden(DR .TARAKESHWAR SINGH) and many more mind blowing pranks and practical jokes.        
                     You look like you don’t give a damn but you are extremely sensitive and caring. You are my good friend now and no matter what happens we will be friends forever.  I will definitely miss your pranks and practical jokes (not those you play on me  :P) but that’s inevitable. All the best to you for your future and yes  ,hell yes you will definitely get what you r searching for….
