<h1 class="page-title">Tarun Khanna</h1><p>I didnt really know him before our chemistry days together,but in our times together,I've really found a great friend in him.He is exceptionally focused and hardworking towards what he wants,and thats something I truly admire in him.He strives for real concepts,more than just marks,and thats another quality of his I'm a big fan of.He is great fun to be around and those CE lab sessions wouldn't have been so productive and fun(!) without him.. Already off to a blazing start,I hope you go a long way,Tarun... All the very best with the great stuff that life has in store for you!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-mankad">Kartik Mankad</a></p>
<p>One of the great men of chemistry. The God of Quantum and the ultimate foe of Organic. Tarun Khanna, the man whose room we swarm into just before the exams hoping to somehow get that extra mark. We have had many discussions on topics ranging from experimental techniques to how to bunk classes without being noticed. He even manages to confuse the teachers. Cheers to him. I hope you remain hale and hearty and continue to baffle everyone with your questions, my friend.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/udit-dewan">Udit Dewan</a></p>
<p>I did not know you properly till my 2nd year 1st sem ends as you are always reserved and we never used to talk till then. You are an awesome cricketer and you deserve to be in the college team. You are one more silent person who always stay till late night. You are studious, planned and disciplined which are the traits of a successful person. I hope you reach great heights and keep in touch buddy.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/v-vijay-krishn">V Vijay Krishn</a></p>
<p>I really didnt know him before this sem. Came to know him in our CE labs. 
Tarun  came across as an extremely focused and ferociously dedicated person. He is someone who doesn't follow convention blindly, he takes up challenges no matter how daunting they may be. HIs determination is truely admirable, He is insanely hard working  in his studies and it really shows how determined he is towards his dream. He has always been an inspiration for me. From him I learnt to be remain focused and determined no matter what.That's the quality in him I like the most. 

A very good friend and extremely helpful in anything you ask him for.Never hesitate to share his knowledge with his friends. He is very straight forward and at the same time tries his best not to hurt anyone.
He is among those friends whose touch remains in your life and whom you will never forget throughout your life . 

I wish him all the best for his coming life :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akanksha--sharma">Akanksha  Sharma</a></p>

<p>My first friend on campus.(other than those I knew before coming to BITS). This is the person who solved all my doubts in all the subjects we shared.(Now we don.t have any common subject :( ). No mater whichever subject it is his concepts are crystal clear. Strong willed,dedicated,devoted and extremely passionate about whatever he takes up I  can assuredly say that he has a great future. A really brainy,witty and jovial person it is really fun to hang out with him. I will always cherish the long discussions we had,the walks,going to nc for juice/ice-cream during compre :P ,the birthdays we celebrated in our corridor,our tt matches (i had a cleans sheet against you :P ). He is also a huge cricket fan and also enjoys football and is a skilled cricketer himself. We still have a memorable year ahead of us and I hope we remain friends even after that :) . All the best buddy!!!!! :)

<p>TK, one of the first persons i know in this campus, so calm , extremely studious, and so dedicated. He is one of the most knowledgeable persons i ever met, always explaining some one or the other. He is very good at sports, cricket and badminton everything!! , Even though our talking has reduced we still share some good jokes. Never seen him angry!!I still remember we challenging each other in badminton. ( i admit you are a better player though :P)  Keep up your attitude man!! All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/r-s-s-harsha">R S S Harsha</a></p>
<p>We had a lot of subjects and classes in common and still do..We had talks too...didn't know him any better than when I got to know "what he really is" during PS1..which I bet could've been  hell without his presence & his spirit of adventure...I still remember the 12 km walk at 2am...and the great tour de Gujarat on the back of a truck at 1am..He's the only person, perhaps, in our chemistry batch who loves chemistry and knows it like a god.He's of the extremely hard working type:::knows and never forgets what he has to do in life..That no doubt is admirable..But what I find most appreciable is his rational thinking and based on that his philosophy of life..With all the things that I mentioned and many more I can guarantee without a doubt his bright career full of research work like any scientist..I just hope and wish that he has a happy life too..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saswat-baruah">Saswat Baruah</a></p>
<p>It s been a really long journey with Tarun , starting all the way back in the heady days of UNO and the corridor tp in 1-1. The TK (ask him the full form, and  its not Tarun Khanna :P) , The Ghadd of our group , its been really a privilege knowing you . An academician in the true sense , his knowledge is not confined to our crappy courses, really has great insight in every subject. Fellow nightwalker , fellow cinehound , fellow Federer fan, fellow football fan ,,,,  . Its been a real pleasure discussing all these things with you . And ya how can I forget PS1 ....all the CS , the movie watching , the Rajbhogs and the Big Bites , the federer matches , the fighting over switches , the harp playing , the discussions with GV,the 9XM songs :D .... truly a memorable experience. And here in campus , all the trips , all the walks .... here’s to many more such memories with you. You don’t need my  luck  but chal still,  for the sake of  formality ,good luck :P.

P.S. Ghumne Chalega ? :P
