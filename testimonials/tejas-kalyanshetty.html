<h1 class="page-title">Tejas Kalyanshetty</h1><p>Kalyan aka Yo is what I like to call COMPETITION :P I mean in terms of the amount of food we order from Shahi & IC :P But no doubt he is king of good food => non-mess food :) I have had good times with this guy, who is pretty humble and darn smart. I will always be grateful to him for lending me the workshop apron without which it would have been impossible for me to stay inside the workshop :P Be awesome as always and all the best for your future. Enjoy & keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Yo!!!! Its not a way of addressing him, bt dats his real nickname (I don't know why he hasn't mentioned it in the nicks list :P) Yo is the guy who knows what it is to 'take lite'....he is a totally chilled out person and a really good friend of mine. He is always willing to help whenever the need be....especially with lending money to people. He is an ardent 'Apple' fan and also has an awesome collection of deos in his room!!!! He hardly visits the mess and always has an excuse of bad quality food in mess, to order from Shahi or IC. And if some day he doesn't, he will visit the NC!!!! It also isn't tough to convince this guy for an outing....he is always ready for one!!!! This is Yo, one of my first and best friends on campus. He will be one of those whom I will surely miss after college days are over. But I am sure we will stay in touch (PS: I will come to Kolhapur to eat Kolhapuri chicken and pandhra rassa :P). Hope you have a great life ahead.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Kalyan , Yo or Saheb is one boring person to hang out with. All he does and talks about day in and out is acads. He has attended every lecture and extra lectures that have taken place. Another feature fascinating about him is his love for mess food. Be it orange , yellow or blue gravy, Kalyan has tried it all and enjoyed it as well. He hates to leave campus and is always locked up in his room. Life would have been so much better if he hadn't been around. Oh wait. Did i just mean the opposite? Cheers!! Best of luck and have a great life ahead.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kartik-chhapia">Kartik Chhapia</a></p>
<p>Yo ! My financier. He has sponsored everything for me. Toilet buddy. He makes weird sounds when angry. We both share a love for good food, booze and other stuff. I don't remember a single outing when he wasn't there. Be it Vasco, Bogmalo, Velino, Road trips etc. Always the first person to get ready. The number of time I have received a financial bailout from this guy can put Greece to shame. He's the guy who picks up the bill on the table and proceeds to collect money from everybody. Invariably ends up paying most of the bill himself and then tells everyone how much each owes him. This is instantly forgotten the next morning. He also owns a palace in Kolhapur. It is said that the whole town lights up and a feast is declared in his honour when he returns. So Yo, I would like to end this  before this gets too embarrassing (for the both us) with the following words : "Majhi daaru, Majhe sutte, Mee Peenar, Mee Fuknaar. Aeeeee". Cheers :D - Fungii
