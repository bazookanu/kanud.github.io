title: Tejas Kudrimoti

<h1 class="page-title">Tejas Kudrimoti</h1><p>Cool.Calm.Lethal.Never overwhelmed by anything. We have never seen Tejas too disturbed by anything. A logical and methodical programmer, he generally finds the quickest (and simplest) solution to a problem.I have never seen a guy get such quick and fast outputs with so few inputs-the number of classes he has attended so far can be counted on fingers. An all-out football fan.A total NFS fan.And he follows his 'Principles'.Yeah! He is one of the guys who operate on the same wavelength as me.I will always remember the 'Rhyme-rhyme' spree we once had-EPIC!--A really treasured friend-he simply never hesitates to help anyone. I dont remember seeing him panic. Ever. He is like a stable,totally reliable,ace-up-his-sleeve guy straight from an Alistair Maclean novel-- All the best to this stormy weather friend!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>teja bhai!!!! Always has a calm demeanor about him , doesn't give a f#$%  about tutorials :D , the only person that I have met that is brave enough to do so. A man of principles ( that's what he likes to call not getting up early ) , he WILL NOT attend a lecture before 9 am. A die hard MANU fan and a football fanatic, he will never miss any champions league or el classico , be it t1,t2,compre on the next day!!! Extremely good coder with sound understanding of the basics, he can master any subject without attending even a single lecture. He is the first person I turn to when I want to go home , always ever-ready to head back to Pune !!!!  The only person who brings life to the completely boring raman-kulkya facebook battle , his wit is unchallenged... Hope( I am sure you will) you have a great future ahead!!!

<p>Me: "Please can I sit here?" Tejas: "Sorry my friend is coming"(Although that friend turned out to be Sahil Deshpande whom I happened to know beforehand :P) These were the very first words exchanged between us at our first chem-1 class at BITS. And from that very moment it all started and now has grown up into a great friendship. Tejas Kudrimoti - happens to be one of the most calm, cool headed and a happy-go-lucky person I have ever met. He is an extremely intelligent guy who comes up with the solution to any given problem in fraction of time(I wouldn't say seconds here coz its not very true for a CS student). Also he is a great sportsman. I remember our continuous TT rallies, those TT matches where you crushed me like a nut and also those where i was all broken and forced to surrender in front of your great game (I will definitely take a revenge over this soon... :P). Also tejas is a die hard football fan and also a huge F1 fan... Most of the time nowadays (since he has an XPS) he spends in playing NFS (and bitching about his XPS :P)..

 You have been one of the best friends I have ever had and an awesome pal to hang out and chat with ( even though the chat many a times is silly and worthless) .. I remember in my second year when you taught me CP2... :D You were better than the faculty I must say.. ;) . I also remember those 'Candy-days' where you me and sahil went on eating candies at Monginis... Lastly, I remember our EPIC journey after the 3rd semester back home and the awesome fun we had during that journey all wintry in the Amboli ghat (IT WAS A NON-AC BUS :P ) ... You are that kind of a person that anyone can totally rely on. An extremely down- to-earth guy, a man of principles...( Principles also include -  "I will never attend any lectures which are before 11 AM" :P) ... An extremely kind and softspoken person by nature.... That kind of a person who is so happy-go-lucky that who happens to play "Angry Birds" for around 4-5 hours just before the DISCO Compre when you haven’t yet started studying.... :P I remember those days... You are truly an awesome friend... I strongly believe that with a brain like yours sky is the limit…You will surely do a great job in future... Thanks for being such a wonderful friend....  Its been a pleasure to have such a fantastic friend… 

PS : Don’t you dare forget me… !!!

<p>Gave the bitsat together,came to bits together,registered together and have been oppi's ever since and he is just the opposite of me always staying calm and even more calmer during exams .I always wonder where does he get all the time in the world for tv series,football,cricket,tennis,tt,computer games and sleep,sleep and sleep (:P).A perfectionist and a very efficient programmer and a principled person ( "attending opti tests is against my principle") and a football and coca cola fanatic.Loves to enjoy life and a pro at whatever he does.All the best!!! (Trivia: There is no room in BPGC that is  more cleaner than AH3-214....)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-satish-kulkarni">Akshay Satish Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>I know Tejas from 11th std when we studied together at DG foundation.An NTS scholar. He is the most calm, cool headed person I have ever seen. He always does whatever he thinks right. He makes his own decisions independently without being carried away by anything. He has amazing conceptual clarity, logical and methodical thinking abilities. He does not attend any tutorial classes 'on principle'. He is a great fan of football,cricket. Wish you all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-sudhir-joshi">Parth Sudhir Joshi</a></p>

<p>"Coming to Mongi?"....these are the most exchanged words between us....I could call Tejas as my Mongi friend! I guess that's how we got to know each other so better with the frequent trips to Monginis and the discussions that followed. And the alternate treat thing that we followed and you always defaulted :P Tejas comes up with some superb one liners whenever there is a discussion going on and can target any person he wants. I also remember the pocket tank competitions we used to have when you used to come to Raman's room.  And his room....so clean!! howz that possible in BITS? i dunno how he does it! I also carry profound memories of the movies we watched together and the lame topics we discussed. Wish u a very bright n beautiful future....Cheers!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vinayak-shinde">Vinayak Shinde</a></p>
<p>Tejas is a very calm and cool headed person.He is big ManU fan, I often see him through window seeing matches :P . He is superb coder and a football and cricket fanatic.He is a guy  who sticks to his words and actions.You will rarely find him attending classes , still manages to do so well in academics.He has the most clean room perhaps in all of BITS , all the girls also can back out one this one.Tejas was the cool wall between me and idiot in MT1....(do you remember he told all the people to shut the fans off in a expt...still remember your reaction :D). We will be seeing really less of each other for the next year .I hope it will be only for a year stay in touch always!.I hope you great success ahead in your life !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prathamesh-dilip-gaikwad">Prathamesh Dilip Gaikwad</a></p>
<p>"Mark idhar hai, mein Teja hun!" Sorry, had to start with that one. :D Tejas is my football comrade, my fellow United-er-in-arms! I remember, I first met him in the Thermodynamics lecture in the first semester and we spent the entire semester cursing the lecturer and trying not to doze off in his class. Tejas is one of the most level-headed and calm persons I have met, the guy rarely gets annoyed. But make no mistake, the he's talented and super smart. Tejas has a sound understanding of the fundamentals of any subject and he seems to master it without attending most of the lectures. :D He's also a man of principles. Aditya and I have tried very hard to break his Vasco wala principle, but without much success! :D The two of us never get bored together, mainly because we love football too much. Whenever there's a good football match on in the common room, you can be sure to find Tejas there. I have fond memories of the countless matches that we've watched, shouting like crazy and cursing other clubs! Tejas is a TV fanatic and he's well known for his ability to finish off entire TV shows in just a couple of nights! Tejas is very reliable and you know you can always count on him. We wont meet each other next sem, but hey, somewhere someplace, there's always the next United match! All the very best for your future! Hopefully, we'll watch a match at Old Trafford (without Sagar of course) before Rooney retires.

<p>I have known Tejas since class 8th and he hasnt changed even a bit .He is a real sharp and brilliant person as he has always been,he can master any course with minimal effort . One quality of Tejas which separates him from the rest is that he is a man of principles : he has never attended any tutorials in his bits life _/\_ for you buddy and goes to mongi daily at night .We have had really a great time with the legen wait for it dary legendary Pocket tank wars(although i won most of the times :P)and of course laddies .He has been a wonderful friend and its always good to have him around .Good luck bro !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raman-ladda">Raman Ladda</a></p>
<p>Writing your second testimonial. (Third, to be exact).Three Years. Hundreds of insults. Mech-CS confrontations. Trek stories. Cocktail-mocktail jabs. Me continually boring you by telling you the Thai-aeroplane-seat-exchange kissa hundreds of times. The Mongi routine. Rhyme rhyme wars. Me continually insulting your favourite movie, you continually insulting one of my favourite bands. Late night kadhi bor na honarya faltoo gappa. Song appreciation, band appreciation. Music room timepass. These are some of the things I'll always miss, and will perhaps never get them back. Saying 'All the Best' to you wont make much of a difference, because you are expert at holding the helm in rough seas. Still, All the best! We are all going to miss you, the only member of Thirteen who has his PS in 4-1. Inertia is gonna miss its Curtis. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>

A rare quality indeed.A true football fan,never seen him missing much matches,even if exams are round the corner.A true roadie(you are not a Shetty) he will achieve whatever he aspires for.All the best for your future endeavors!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-thakare">Nakul Thakare</a></p>
<p>Tejas was one of the first Marathi friends I had in campus. If there is any Marathi word I know, its because of Tejas and Sagar. I got introduced to the Large-Maharashtra-gang-of-AH3 mostly because of Tejas and Sagar. Had an amazing time with all you guys. Having Tejas as a neighbor, along with Kulkya and Mudit, was an absolute blast. I guess the best times we had together were when we just sat in Mudit's room late at night and did tp to the early hours of the morning. I owe Tejas a big thanks for introducing me to two things- Family Guy and Linkin Park. One reason why I enjoyed hanging around with him was because his sense of humor and sarcasm matched mine :P I can remember countless instances when Sagar was completely dumbfounded by the jokes we cracked (mostly at him) :D
I'll really miss having you around. The memories gathered over these 3 years will be cherished for many years to come. I doubt I'll ever have a neighbor again that can match the fun we had. I hope you have a wonderful future ahead and may you succeed in every task you set out for :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-sharma">Alok Sharma</a></p>
<p>Tejas! The mongi dude :D . I first met this guy in the comon room, playing carrom. I was surprised to know that he was in the same college as me in +2, but I guess we never met because we never really went there :D. I remember he had come here with ENI as his branch... I'll never forget the smile that lit up his face when he got CS (i myself was frowning because I had been upgraded to Maths :P). We had the most amazing time playing TT in our first year. Damnit, we never should have stopped. I was never ever able to handle Tejas' smashes. I was however really happy when he beat Sagar for the first time. Tejas is one of the mos "balanced" people I have ever seen. He takes a decision, and really lives with it (unlike me :P) and thats what I admire about him the most. You've been a great friend Tejas! We'll obviously keep in touch :D. Good luck mate!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aniket-panse">Aniket Panse</a></p>
