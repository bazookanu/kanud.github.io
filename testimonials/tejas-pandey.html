<h1 class="page-title">Tejas Pandey</h1><p>Pandeyyyyyyyyy is one of my favourite people on campus ! His idiosyncrasies make you want to talk to him more and more ! An ardent follower and  connoisseur of drama , literature and trivia, he has not only entertained people with those perfect acting skills on stage but also otherwise no one can exchange pleasantries the way he does ! An eccentric gujju ( sometimes you feel like he resembles the lad from jamnagar and yet manages to go out with the most sophisticated gentle lady on campus :P) He is got a wide reach from dalal street to the Ambani Bens ! The trading dark knight hidden  in him is preparing for the rum  to benefit from the bull -bear fight and seek the mulla in style ! Very entertaining , helpful , humble and happy go lucky person ... i am sure he will go a long way in life and success no doubt will come his way... Hope to bump into you sometimes in Bombay ! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gauri-m-mangalgiri">Gauri M Mangalgiri</a></p>
