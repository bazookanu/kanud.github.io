<h1 class="page-title">Tejendar Singh</h1><p>Teji as the whole campus addresses him is actually THE Man in BITS.
Hats off to his dedication towards Gym n fitness.he has got a multi-talented personality , his tabla performances are simply awesome and he is probably the only drummer of AH-5.Even after beaming with so much talent he is very humble n down to earth guy.His comments n ideas on each topic are sensible and well thought.You wont find him doing ny nonsense activity in campus.moreover he is true punjabi by heart........even after "one KHAMBA" down this man stands tall n never lets any1 else also down :P(remember the nite out) I m proud to have such a friend and padosi .......thanks man fr ur company ....god bless u n may u achieve the best of everything in life....!!!!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kapil-aggarwal">Kapil Aggarwal</a></p>
<p>Mr.Rourkela d00d ! A true sardar well built but he doesnt do something that all go and do in Rourkela ! Hadnt talked to him ever in college before 2-2, when I came to know that this sardarji belongs to Rourkela my PS station, I was a bit happy :P. At PS, it was fun , that bindaas attitude and his jokes and one liners are just apt for moments to cherish. I shall miss Rourkela throughout my life, those days were just awesome. Being in Msc Maths, what I feel now is I missed a lot of fun not attending classes coz time spent with you cud have been fun. Those PS visits and making fun of Mr.Patel was fun.

Do stay in touch coz I might come sometime to Rourkela :) .
PS. Get me some gifts from Rourkela please !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Hmm .. teji ..!!   A great physique and still control over himself defines his nature . A very calm and composed individual who you will never see over excited watsoevr ..  He never even thinks of putting his hands on others coz as one incident goes , he delivered a punch to a person who lost his consciousness then and there ... :P thats how strong he is ..!! And if you wanna know the reason .. just come to C mess .. !  we have been mess partners since a long time .. everytime meeting in the mess for brkfast coincidently. He eating around 10 eggs , and me eating around 10 puris .. we were a perfect supporter for each other  ;) . He is the only person i have seen to stand still and behave normal after having a whole bottle ..  # niteout at curlies  ..!! He has been a great one for ah5 in zephyr FASH P  and also the drummer he is .. A great lover of indian classical music .. My only thoda thoda supporter when it comes to WWE talks ....All these things will always come to my mind when i wud think about you  .. It is great to having known you for all this time and would wish of luck for all your future plans ..!!  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aayush-jain">Aayush jain</a></p>

<p>Teji bhai....I really came to know him well during our MT2 practs when we were in the same group. He is a very calm and down-to-earth person who hardly loses his cool. Nothing needs to be said about his music abilities. Not only is he a great Tabla player but also an awesome singer.... We have another year together in Mech after Math....lets enjoy our last year in BITS and hope we stay in touch even after college. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pratik-hegde">Pratik Hegde</a></p>
<p>Tejendar aka Teji is a man of steel with a heart of gold :).... bold and courageous yet kind and compassionate. He is probably the strongest guy on campus but still Nonviolent and peaceful at heart.... he is a guy who lives by his own terms instead of blindly following the masses. Teji is a true friend who will always help you out in any way he can  ... I can never forget the times he got me out of trouble and backed me up..... Teji is also a very fun loving and adventurous guy, he loves watching movies/TV series, traveling, music, gyming, cricket, football, badminton etc... A talented musician he plays tabla and drums.... he has also been a kick boxing champion... to sum it all up Teji is an awesome, cool guy  and I am grateful to have a friend like him... I am sure he is meant for great things ahead... Have a gr8 future Tejiâ€¦ :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gokul-v--shetty">Gokul V  Shetty</a></p>
