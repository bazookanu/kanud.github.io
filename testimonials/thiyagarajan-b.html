<h1 class="page-title">THIYAGARAJAN B</h1><p>Wherever this person sets his foot, the end result is success. I did not know him well until PS1 at ceeri. He took up the most difficult project from among those offered and completed successfully in no time such that the scientists working there were marvelled at his work. He is not a typical nerd but comes out of his room after class hours for music nite where he showcases his exceptional talent playing the keyboard. May he rise as high as the marks he scores. Wish you all the best<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abishek-ramgopal">Abishek Ramgopal</a></p>
<p>Tyagi..... He's very intelligent and hard-working person. One of the top ENI phodus. Isko exam ke pehle kabhi kuchh nai aata aur iske exam mein, jo isse nai aata, wo kabhi nai aata :P . Waise banda hai mast ekdum. He is ultimate fun to hang out with. MJ fan. Music lover. An amazing keyboard player as well (seriously man :respect:). All the best for your future Tyagi !!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>

<p>Tyagi, its not his name but that's what people call him. The THIYAGRAJA of eni, this guy is one of my closest friends in bits and probably the sharpest among our group. You won't be able to tell how talented this guy is on your first  impression of him. But believe me this guy is a 'dark horse''. One of those guys who never seem to study a lot( and i am witness to this) but somehow manage to phoduphy the exam every time. He is a terrific player of the keyboard, most of us know that and can also sing pretty decent. His ability to manage work with fun is amazing. He is an avid gamer, never misses out on any new releases on dc, always takes out time for his musical interests always spends time with friends yet somehow manages time to do the lesser important things in life...( open the text book). If you want to piss him off there are two ways, say something against vellore or say a word against MJ. Although the vellore trick has started to loose its touch the MJ trick never fails to give results :P. He is a very good friend, always ready to help you out even if he has to go out of his way to do so. He is a very modest person who always downplays his achievements. He is also very close to his family. Tyagi I have had some great times with you , be it the coffee and poha in the IC , or the drunken sprees at bogmalo, you have given me some good memories. I know that you are going to go a long way in life , so you don't need too much of luck for that. Stay in touch ..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>tyagi is simply the most amazing guys of our hostel. i have never come across a guy more simple, humble and genuine. he always speaks his heart which is clear with not a trace of malice. funny guy. making someone smile comes so naturally to him, even making him smile is one of the easiest things u can do to him. he doesnt get irritated easily nor hold grudges with anyone. he still has that child like innocence and gullibility preserved in him, which sadly is lost in most of us. 
an ardent MJ fan, admirer of Aishwarya's beauty, virtuoso in keyboard, loves kids, soccer and F1 follower, a gamer, and derives pleasure from almost all forms of art!. such a dynamic personality!
i have had the privilege to share some epic moments with him, be it our beach trips, mess discussions, the racist jokes (which were usually Yafis's), or those lovely fights over the most random and weirdest topics in your room. i enjoyed it all and it has become a sweet part of my memory.
tyagi, u never fail to surprise me with your soft spoken and mellow nature. do not change for anyone and anything. 
you'll go a long way, all the luck to you! wont use cliches  cuz i know you won't forget me! (i won't let you ;D )

<p>Simply one of the most talented, sweet, modest, friendly,soft-spoken, helpful and humble persons on the campus, even on the whole Earth. He is an artist. I don't really remember how we met and became friends, but he is one person whose company  I enjoy a lot - be it the chammak challo playing, music nites, or his BLACK waali CRUSH talks, the trips, the mess and of course, tping in his room :D We have had some really fun and great times together :) And I hope we'll keep having them in the future *nostalgic* 
He is everything you can ask for in a person, though is too thin to be called one :P All his qualities have been listed above and there is no point in me repeating them. I asure you he must be having whatever you are thinking.  And seriously I have no idea how you lay down in 'that' position for whole day and still not get a backache (:P) and listen to all kind of wierd music and watch those action sequences...
Of the toppers but not the really studious one, manages everything well - be it his music, acads, or his tamil movies. However, you should not watch him bat though. A good advisor, maths wizard and a good friend - you are \m/
May you go and do what you want, and as much as I know you, you'll certainly be successful in it :) All the Best. And never change.

<p>My first friend on campus. I have known very few people who are so humble, soft-spoken and friendly. It was 1-1 when Tyagi, Bunty, Yafis, Balaaji, Sumit & me used to spend hours & hours discussing random & overly-hypothetical circumstances, played Truth-or-dare, me beating him in FIFA 10 (btw which was a 49 match unbeaten streak), & then him beating me with all his pent up aggression in FIFA 11. :P
AND man he is A fantastic Musician. The sessions of "Numb by LP" & what-not songs we used to jam in his room were the epitome of my "Singing career"..(ahem ahem) :D
Finally, his diligent studying has to mentioned. It was truly remarkable how he has saved me a few subjects on more than 1 occasion. I am still terrified of him being 1 of the coolest geniuses on campus.
Dude, you are really a nice friend, one whom I truly respect and will always cherish the nicest of memories with you.
I always wish the best for you in life!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>

<p>Tyagi is one of the most  genuinely sweet people that I have come across here at BITS. I still remember the first time we met, planting trees behind the workshop area, attempting in our own small capacity, to make our campus greener. Well three years have passed since then, and although the trees we planted didn't survive, our friendship did :) In-fact, he's holds the privilege ( yes tyagi "privilege" :P) of being the only guy I've never had a fallout with, and this fact that makes him even more special. Well,to be honest, I sincerely believe it has more to with his ability of charming everyone through his innate sincerity and simplicity. I remember him from his first year days, from sleeping at 10 pm at night to now roaming around at 3 a.m. , he, indeed, has come a long way, though one thing that he retains from his first year days is scoring A in every subject. That being said, I really consider it to be an honour to be his friend and I know he'll go a long way. Cheers :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yafis-sahaf">Yafis Sahaf</a></p>
<p>A guy who always begin a conversation with a smile, i came to be his friend though our legendary carom table, who has given me so many friends,He is one of the TOPPER of our ENI batch.Has a lot of grey matter, but is very humble and always helpful , be it exams or assignments, he teaches people of other branches too. , a complete _/\_.
A ferocious MJ fan, a word against him can make u tyagi's biggest enemy.albeit he has started drinking and doing other uber cool things, he is one of the most religious person i know, along-with yafis.A tuned keyboardist, he rock acads even with his music commitments, he is a complete all rounder,  has seen a lot of changes in him, from a veg to voracious chicken eater.Its sad this is our last semester in our campus. mAy u always be happy in ur life<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saurav-kumar">Saurav kumar</a></p>
<p>He is a guy who can always be seen working on his laptop lying in a weird posture. He is a very hardworking and energetic guy and the source of his energy is PARACETAMOL(98.7F hote hi paracetamol kha leta h). Though he always screw up his exams but is always lucky to get an A (exam to ganda gya tha but teacher ne li8 grading kiya :P). A huge fan of Yanni and MJ (and rajnikant). A brilliant keyboardist and will be a brilliant guitarist in a few months. And a great friend with whom i have spent a great time. Isko pareshan karna was a part of my life and i'll miss teasing him when he won't be around. All the best for future (with LnL Co.) I know you will ace in every step of life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/saransh-rawat">SARANSH RAWAT</a></p>
<p>The guy with the next id number. Typical ENI mate. Seen him change over 3 years, and I doubt any one would have predicted then, what this guy would end up becoming. Loves Blur and chudaaps of differnt level. Enjoys studying and gets tense about it. So much so that he even agrees that if he gets through the exams he will allow me to format his computer. His computer has changed, but yet he hasnt allowed me that. Chal cya in 4-2.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhaavan-merchant">Bhaavan Merchant</a></p>
<p>Tyagi is one of those rare guys with whom you can share anything and although he is a bit lazy but he always helps out when its needed the most. He has an enigmatic personality and a certain innocence to his nature. He is the most esteemed and talented keyboardist i have met and now he ameliorated his guitaring skills as well. His learning ability is beyond doubt tremendous although he requires to be nudged a lot. He derives happiness from small things and has funny aspirations like how he would wish he turns out to be a cow in his next life so that he can chew paneer and all his favourite foods all the time  He is a lazy genius. Tyagi has taught me a lot even though he would still maintain otherwise.

Okay about that weird posture of yours... I still can't figure out how you sit in that peculiar fashion on your bed ...please don't  and don't you dare make me look frail with your new found guitaring abilities in 4-2.

I have had a wonderful time at BITS and hope that we continue to remain great friends for life. All the best in life.
