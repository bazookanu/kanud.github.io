<p>Kumud aka Newein(Newton+Einstein) aka BLOOD is seriously god next to god(as we already have a god in our group).He used to be an icon in first sem as he used to attend almost all the classes in a day,I mean he prepared another timetable where he used to attend almost 7-8 classes a day and use to study everyday and we use to take his notes for help..Then in second sem he started with same tempo and slowly graph started to fall and he fell to such point that he started to stop attending even his own classes...The reason is his addiction to films..He is a movie addict and he watches almost 3-4 movies i guess and then he should have completed them in 1 or 2 sems(Mind it-he watches mostly Telugu films not any other languages generally),but still he didnt complete because he says he doesn't remember these movies after 1 or 2 days ..He is core member is DOS and worked like anything for Ugadi fest and also a great downloader in our campus and host of a hub too and good editor of videos and list goes on....He doesnt work on anything but if he works on anything then no one can match his dedication in that field ..atleast i havent seen anyone...But unfortunately he didnt get that interest in his acads which made him to fall down more and more...he has the potential to achieve great things but he doen't channelize his energy in right direction and when he starts to do it in right way we will see the real KUMUD and he will do wonders..Mind it..Hope you will go in right way and achieve great things and have a nice life ahead  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
<p>Perfect Geek God...And Very dedicated to whatever work he does..I still remember when he didn't even hesitate to bunk his exam to complete the technical work that he was doing during Ugadi..And Popularly known as "BLOOD" for the same attitude..Have to learn a lot from him..Very popularly known as NEWEIN in DC which I need not mention...No more words to describe...Hope that all your talents would be helpful for your bright future..All the Best.....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nunna-sathwik">Nunna Sathwik</a></p>
