<h1 class="page-title">Tuhin Sah</h1><p>You are _/\_ _/\_. I do not know you. You're amazing speech n attitude during the farewell makes me write this testimonial. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chandrahas-muvvala">Chandrahas Muvvala</a></p>
<p>In the middle of the night walking around in the hostel fiddling with his hair. Dressing usually in monochrome and an umbrella in hand, he would sit in the first row of every class still fiddling with his hair.

Calling him the huge wrestling fan would be an understatement.
His grasp of english the language is remarkable. I remember that I had begged him to write and article to describe our hostel for the hostel newsletter which he finally agreed to and in just a few hours he produced a spectacular article.

I wish I had the chance to get to know you better.

Tuhin Sah. The one, the only.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/asif-majeed">Asif Majeed</a></p>
<p>I must say when I came to know that you were in my group in TRW, I was curious to know you and to know what you’re made of. I wasn’t disappointed. As time elapsed, I learnt that Tuhin Sah is made of good manners, politeness, with a rather opinionated outlook on things, a gentle speaker off-stage and a melodramatic one on it.  Big on thinking, I presume, and magniloquent in speech. Something tells me you have an inclination to flamboyance. But what really hit me was that you are a confident person, kind at heart and caring in thought. Believe me I never can forget your constant proposals of waking me up in the morning. I never did avail of them, of course, but I appreciated them all the same. Your words of appreciation have always felt absolutely real and I thank you for them. And then of course is the award you got for being yourself. Trust me the first thought that occurred to me at that moment was “He deserves it!” and that’s true. You have the nature to be yourself in and out: use this to become great for it is a quality greatness requires. May you have the best things that life has to offer. Remain true to yourself. You will achieve everything you aspire for.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/agam-balooni">Agam Balooni</a></p>
<p>Watch Out, we got a badass over here :Neil deGrasse: The level of awesomeness this guy possesses is too damn high :Jimmy McMillan:
His motto - Bitch, I'm fabulous. He talks, walks and acts Like a Sir. I could dedicate a whole day's worth of trending posts on 9gag to this guy. Better yet, he could have his own internet meme - "<b>Like a Tuhin</b>" ;). He is the biggest 9gag/meme fan, at least on this campus. He also happens to be, as per his own words - "The biggest wrestling fan in mainland Asia". He carries a certain distinct aura around him. Wherever he goes, he carries his own swag of Élan. 
If truth were to be told, when I first saw him walking around alone, in matching clothes, an umbrella in one hand and twirling hairs in the other; he seemed a bit looney to me. However truth can't be further(or closer?) from/to it. He is a genius. He's one of those rare breed who dare to be different, as has been evident during the farewell. He is one of the guys for whom i have utmost respect. It has always been a pleasure having a conversation with you, especially the lengthy discussions involving 9gag and memes and troll. This form of interactive, spontaneous communication between two or more people who are following rules of etiquette will surely be missed. Best wishes for your future. Stay in touch :).

P.S : This part is just to annoy you !!! U MAD BRO !? :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
<p>People might not want talk to you at their first glance but I can assure you that they are missing out a very important person.Tuhin,you have the power of leaving deep impressions in very short meetings. I am very inspired by you and many of your thoughts. Talking to you is just like the sweetest part of the day...... You have always been polite and always ready to help others. You once told me that we actually spend too much time thinking what others will think when I do this or that instead of caring for what we actually want to do and that's actually true.
People say you are different , I say yes u are but its not the difference from outside that really matters ..the difference comes from within you.. And I salute you for that....
 You will turn out to be a great leader. Hope you get great success in life. Will miss those TRW and POM presentations.......tc..... and be in touch..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>
<p>Tuhin Sah. There are so many names people call you with. To enumerate: A psycho, weirdo & a pretentious scamp to a kind hearted, caring and gifted guy. (You indeed have a gifted brain) So which version is really true?? All of them to some extent. But then we love people cause for their values and not vices. So when i list all the things i love you for and the reasons for which i don't, I get to the following conclusion. It is true that you get on my nerves at times, it is true that you are just impossible and a poser at times. It is evident that you love being different (even at the sake of just being one). Self obsessed he is, and perfectly okay with that he seems (Y U NOO not such a big Star wars fan?). 
However, I am in a safe position to say that I know you quite well and I have to confess that I find you to be caring towards everyone you have ever met. And one thing that I will never forget is how you have helped me look at the world, rationally and impartially. You are the guy who has helped me learn how to stand up to oneself and have helped me conceive objective reality, have introduced me to the works of Ayn Rand. I guess all these things clearly out weigh the ones which piss me off. Thanks for being my room mate, alarm clock and grammar check. Thanks for everything.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>

<p>tuhin...emotionally strong...self dependent...hard working...doesn’t give a shit about what others think of him,and is happy about the way he is .
Generally,doesn’t  indulge much in extra –acads-wwe  stuffs,but when he does , he does it like a boss ? 
wwe...he really knows it like no one..inside out 
now most of us are aware that tuhin is a great orator.He has been putting his orating skills to practice on me for the past 3 years  be it about going to classes or jogging 
or any other thing.Tuhin they have been very educative and inspiring.:D
one of the few persons i know who lives by his principles.
He is a very mature guy,but sometimes  does childish things which have always brought a smile on my face.
it has been an awesome 3 years tuhin....i wish you all the best for life yaar!!!
i think you can become a wwe general manager one day :D

<p>I'm 'Future Endeavor'ed?? In that case, YOU'RE FIRED!! 
Jokes aside, it has truly been a privilege knowing Tuhin, and our lengthy discussions and debates on Pro Wrestling shall always remain memorable to me. You being a veteran fan, combined with your rather spooky and mysterious persona reminds me of the Undertaker. With me being Triple H, as we stand at the threshold of leaving the grand stage that is BITS, i cannot help but feel that this is the 'End of an Era'. It goes without saying that people like Tuhin Sah come by just 'Once in a Lifetime'. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arjun-mathew-eranacal">Arjun Mathew Eranacal</a></p>
<p>He is silent, calm, thoughtful, polite, decisive and immensely caring at heart. Add to this a British accent and a confident stature, a recipe for Tuhin Sah. We have shared thoughts on almost anything that would make us worldly wise. His opinions full of rationality provide me with a clear picture upon topics that are abstract in most respects. When my restless being asks him questions, he would answer in detail, as a preacher does. I can never forget that childlike laughter which makes me smile. It is impossible to not to take note of him when he is around! He inspires effortlessly in his thoughts and mannerisms, which are grand and rational. He wouldn’t do a thing that he doesn’t really want to do. Being different is not a way to show off, but to freely express his inner being. The fact that he wouldn’t let himself get pounded by the usual ‘mills’ makes him unique and respectful. His character is simple, honest, brave and ‘free’ as I would say. We bonded quickly, in a small time, and I can’t express how attached I feel to him. We have sat for hours chatting, strolled at length discussing, accepting, learning and debating over everything. I would cherish those moments with you. I would be lying if I said I didn’t want to emulate him. We are not separating for now, but we shall, and I hope I bump into you in future. It’s been amazing, knowing you. Just be the Tuhin, you are! Cheers!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-kapoor">Anubhav Kapoor</a></p>
<p>Took too much time to think what to write, cuz you cannot be described in words. I might not have interacted with him much, but down the line, I have developed respect for this amazing human being. You'll always be known as the Umbrella Guy. Your accent is simply amazing. I wish I could confer "<b>Sir Tuhin Sah</b>" on you. Stay the way you are! God Bless.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>you are easily one of the the most interesting and different person i have ever come across. knowing you for the past 15 years has been a treat. even though we do not interact that much just having you around is comforting in a way. 
i hope you have a fulfilling life and achieve all that you wish to
all the very best<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arushi-gupta">Arushi Gupta</a></p>
