<h1 class="page-title">Tushar Mandar</h1><p>Mandoo, is one hell of a happy-go-lucky guy ,who despite his lousy study habbits ,has constantly scored the best Cgpa in our batch. One of the best friends I ever made in my life.
Best thing about him :he believes in himself ....Great guy to hang out with , always lighthearted  and has a ,well ,we can say 'a sense of humour' arguably though..:) . Will miss the time spent with u Mandoo...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/amit-kumar">Amit Kumar</a></p>
<p>Here is one guy who chooses to hide his true self, and he
has been quite successful at it. How he is able to hide his spark 
of brilliance is an answer that always evades me. An extremely sharp 
brain combined with an infinite capacity to handle stress makes him
the excellent person to work with. He shows his true nature only to his close friends and only if they are attentive enough to notice it.
I on a personal level share an amazing chemistry with him. His ability 
to turn all problems into jokes and an immediate pursuit to solve them
inspires me. He will always try to be as annoying as he can but when 
when it comes to important aspects his approach is phenomenal. 
I have enjoyed all the time I have spent with him. He will excel in any
field/ endeavour he chooses in life. And I am not going anywhere, I will always be there.For all that you have done for me.... I love you Tushar. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pritesh-gudge">Pritesh Gudge</a></p>
<p>Mandar! ( I am not mentioning your special name here somehow but it shall always stay in our hearts! :P ). Tushar Mandar in undoubtedly one of my closest friends in campus. I have known him since my very first year and knowing him has been one hell of an experience. His reputation of extreme intelligence and logical aptitude precedes him but all of us know that he is much more than just another 10 pointer. He is an amazing person and I've had lots and lots of wonderful memories with him. Our numerous bus trips to Vasco, dominos, panjim etc have been amazing! Ive shared a lot with him including my first ever business venture in which me made a profit of Rs 100. As a person,  he is truly caring and is always ready to help you no matter what. Straighforward and sharp, this guy has a long long way to go in life. Ill really miss all the times Ive spent with him, going to the mess, going to shahi, after dinner walks, cheap and insane jokes, ill miss it all. I know that our friendship will always stay thus Ill just wrap up by writing All the best for your future man! Hope you attain all the success and prosperity that you desire. Stay in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/hemant-bhatt">Hemant Bhatt</a></p>
<p>Tushar Mandar!! Doesnot look like a 10p right?? You bet he does not. Cause he is just so goddamn down to earth. I have had the privilege to work with him at times, couple of ES2 classes and ofcourse Numb3rs.. He is just blazing lightning fast.. A marvelous brain. I haven't know him that close, but have always seem him in a jolly mood, ready to make friends and to understand new stuff, have never seen him speaking ill of anyone, have always found his company so pleasing. Stay as you are.(I bet you will)You sure are going to scale great heights. Keep in touch mate. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Tushar Mandar is a very humble person. He doesn't hesitate in helping others. He is very dedicated and hardworking person. His intelligence has ensured him a good CGPA (10pointer) . He is the topper of our batch. No one knows what he does before exams that he gets so good marks. I wont forget you PJs, treats & boxing and all our conversations in the corridor. He thinks logically and does work logically.  congrats him for getting internship abroad at Mitacs with scholarship. He always excels at whatever he does.. wish you all the best for future and hope you scale heights with your efforts and dedication. You will be missed as one of my close friends at campus..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>
