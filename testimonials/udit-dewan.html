<h1 class="page-title">Udit Dewan</h1><p>The mysterious man of AH3. You are a curious creature filled with the strangest idiosyncrasies. For one you rarely venture out of your room, for another you study way more than you should. We had some fun times, some totally pointless discussions, postulated unique theories that will sadly never be proved and in general enjoyed our time together. I wish you a great life and a greater career.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>

<p>Udit... one silent guy... who is always in a world of his own... When he speaks.. he speaks with enough confidence to convince anyone that he knows what he's upto.. (even if sometimes he doesnt have a clue :P ) ...he's the guy who is the first to come to class and is seen occupying the first row even when others sit right behind... something makes me think he could make a real good professor... ( always thought so , just saying it ) .. i am sure your unique way of thinking will get you far in life... You're different... stay different! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nehal-bhatia">Nehal Bhatia</a></p>
<p>UD. One of the first BITSian friends I made here and I have some of the best and the worst memories in his company, read that as his room, for he is someone who does not venture out much. 
I hated you then and I shall hate you for the rest of my life for that photograph you took at Nescafe and the rest that followed. Yes, he is a photographer, and he tends to be the best in capturing people in between the transitions of facial expressions. Although we don't hang out that much these days, I shall forever cherish the memories I share with you no matter how much you irritate me by messing with my hair or by your playlists. I sincerely want to write down each and every one of the crazy things we did, and keep doing, but as Kedar keeps saying, I shall let them remain in memory. 
And it's pointless to ask you to stay in touch, for I doubt you'll never leave my precious hair alone or stop calling me by that nick name you coined!
Cheers man!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/charith-kandala">Charith Kandala</a></p>
<p>Ever eager to learn and teach people, solve their doubts and his own, I've never seen anyone so enthusiastic in classes! How do you do it, Udit? He's a quiet guy, who keeps to himself a lot, but there's something cooking in that brain that's going to leave us all in awe one day, of that I'm sure. Keep at it Udit! Here's wishing you all the best in life =)
P.S. He's secretly a football star. Remember the Chemistry trip football game? Watch out, Rooney's of the world, I say!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ayeesha-khanna">Ayeesha Khanna</a></p>
