<p>I love the very four years of the life we had together !!!  All i can describe you is lazy(sleepy) ,but the pretty cool person i ve seen ,even right before the crucial moment  you still manage to give your best :D All i call you always happy person and you do make people happy with the very nature of your own :P but you could not with only one (Sheron :P) . You have a lot that people need to learn from you ;) but this is true :) All i could end this up is just say even in the last minute i m your only partner so take care of me always :P :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/satya-deepak">Satya deepak</a></p>
<p>Fun n Food,thats Vijay Krishn(and i am still confused why it is not Krishn'A' ).
He always is a food loving fun guy to be around with. i have never seen him pissed off and always comes with a solution for the situation(although sometimes it is out of context :P).
I love him for the reason he is always himself. He doesn't give a damn about what people think and never change the way you are for someone else.
Keep going in the same same way no matter what ppl say , wish you all the success in future  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-gupta-akirala">Tarun Gupta Akirala</a></p>

<p>Vijji, its an awesome experience to be your neighbor and I really wanna kick you for taking a room on the top floor in CH1. He is the most fun-loving person I have seen in my entire life. His room is like a mecca of entertainment for us, and we cant really deny that. Messed up a lot in the first year and I am really impressed that you kept your cool. and came out of it. Now, I am seeing a more dedicated version of VK. One of the responsible entities for finishing food in everyone's room, he is one foodie who just can eat and go about it. Sorry, for having your speakers in my room more than yours. But you know, that I like to create noise for the corridor. A great fan of gadgets and computer games. I just suggest you one thing. Don't ever try to do what others are doing around you. That doesn't matter at all. Do what you really want to do and you'll surely achieve success in that. I hope you understand that. Wish you a very best of luck for what lays ahead. Keep in touch....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shobhit-sharma">Shobhit Sharma</a></p>

<p>Vijji is one of the coolest people on campus. Period. Super sweet and innocent, its always fun to talk to you and sharing a laugh with you is almost always enough to make a bad day better. Though we seriously became friends in the third year over ConSys and games, I feel now as if I have known you for years. You are highly interested in gaming and I THANK GOD for that because you are the only person in my corridor who is is interested in gaming apart from me :-\. A sad thing that you will be staying away from us next sem but this one year joking around with you has been AWESOME. So keep up your funny exploits and never lose your innocence as it is one of your best qualities. Best of luck for the road ahead, have loads of fun, play loads of games and succeed in everything you do in the future :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhay-dokania">Abhay Dokania</a></p>

<p>Viji is super li8 in all academic aspects. A cool guy to hang out. Initially he was a bit shy and refrained from talking. Loads of memories in his room, playing hot pursuit in his laptop. His room like a adda, if u r bored just drop in and u will surely have lots of fun. Bored during exam or lonely AH3 229 is the only solution. He tries very hard to study before tests but kya karein ENI subs don’t make him feel like studying. He’s also interested in cars and regrets sometimes I should have taken mechanical. His innocence will help him reach greater heights. Good luck for future!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
