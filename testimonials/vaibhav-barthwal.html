<h1 class="page-title">Vaibhav Barthwal</h1><p>Toxi the rhino !  This person doesnt ever understand what to when and why ? From being a shy idiot to a estud now, I have seen many changes in him. Spending time on DC or hanging out the whole nite talking about random things, seeing movies together and sharing food its been an awesome journey my friend. 
Being my travel buddy back home, we have come across some of the most exciting journeys back home. Always there when you need him and helps with views in any field you would ask help for.
I remember him for his Sutta sprees in exams, his guy smokes like a monster just before the exams.  And yeah this chap is a GOOD player when it comes to computer gaming - CS, MWF2 and loads of those fps games with NFS. 
That Sansani role he did in Maharashtra Mandal cultural shall be cherished for years to come. 
From being playing games and sleeping in room to studying in lib and roaming in campus - what a change ! 
Thanks for teaching me something I remember in 2-2 either MUP or CAS something I do remember........
Be the same person you are, enjoy your life and be the rhino ! 
PS. Spend sometime in hostel  too !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/subodh-kolhe">Subodh Kolhe</a></p>
<p>Toxi is a man of style! He is the kind of guy who bulldozes into an idea in life, rides on it for sometime and eventually comes to terms with it, the manly way! No one messes with him and of course he doesn't involve himself in petty stuff either. A very frank person at heart and quite a cool guy to hang out with! One prominent thing that we share in common is that, both of us like to play loud music especially when we're stressed out, with a small difference though, that I play it on my musical instrument(s) and he does so on his speakers. My part goes awry sometimes and I have let it piss him off a couple of times! :P
He's quite an avid gamer and that defines his nick. He's quite helpful at heart and wouldn't mind going miles to help a friend in trouble! 
Be the man that you are and keep your style always! 
All the best! :)
