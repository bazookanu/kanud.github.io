<h1 class="page-title">Vaibhav Uppal</h1><p>Heard about this from a lot of 

people, so I would say it here - 

Uppal is the only person in our group 

who glows, not surprising considering 

that he has converted his room into a 

beauty parlour. That's what you would 

garner from a first glance at him, be 

around him for more than  a couple of 

 minutes, and that glow would quickly 

dim if he subjects you to one of his 

'jokes'/'shaayari'/'rap'. The amount 

of bad jokes I have listened to in 

the last year is far greater than all 

the PJs I have heard before that - 

all thanks to Uppal. And these are 

not your regular low-life jokes; the 

obscenity content in our mess 

conversations has increased radically 

 ever since Uppal has joined our 

table. Apart from these wonderful 

abilities though, Uppal is single-

handedly the most sincere guy I have 

ever meet, having attended ALL 

lectures from his first year till 

now. Finding him in the classroom is 

reassuring, that everything in this 

world is normal. All teachers have 

felt a special sort of connection 

with him, the most recent victim of 

Vaibhav's charm being Nitin Sharma 

ji, who has taken to calling him 

Uppalji nowadays. All that said and 

done, Uppal is an extremely good 

person at his core, a very helpful 

being if you ever ask him anything 

and a great friend to hang out with. 

He is extremely dedicated to his 

academics, and takes great pains to 

study the subjects he wants to. He 

has been an excellent friend for the 

past 2.5 years that I have know him. 

Again, this guy would be running away 

to PS next sem, so yes, he adds to 

the short list of people I am gonna 

miss for whatever time I have left 

over here.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>Uppal praaji aka PJ king is the angry boy of our wing .A no nonsense guy,he is smart ,dashing and has a pathetic sense of humor (and that makes the PJ king title apt for him  :D). All these years that i have known him he has become very patient and calm and handles tense situations very well.He is that typical 'padaku' student and has his goals and ambitions clear.He is very methodical and regular in his studies but apart from this 'keeda' inside him he is a fun loving guy.His absolute love for everything punjabi sometimes gets on my nerves but that's the best part about him.He is a very caring and helpful friend.I wish you good luck for the future :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basant-sharma">Basant Sharma</a></p>
<p>The PJ king. Cracks unbeatable PJ's ( and poems too). His ability to socialize is unbelievable. He knows almost every one 

(excluding a few girls) of '09 batch personally. Very intelligent and fond of Electronics (digital electronics, to be precise). 

Extremely fun-loving, very good at doing 'chutiyapanti' :P but yes, he is very good at heart, always cheerful, trust worthy and has high ethical and moral values when it comes to friends and family. He is a very grateful person and is always willing to help. He has "fun, anyhow and in anyway" as his philosophy of life. A very big Tottenham and Luiz Suarez fan. I am really lucky to have a friend like him :) All the best for your future endeavours :)  PS: your PJ's shall be missed :(<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ch--sai-prasanth">Ch  Sai Prasanth</a></p>
<p>Ever since Vaibhav Uppal joined our mess table, our discussions have turned from great to epic. His ability to crack pjs (or on the spot poems) is pretty unique and a real entertainer. You can always expect laughs and smiles around wherever he is sitting. He knows more than half of the campus personally, you can always see people greeting him wherever he goes. Apart from this he is a student par excellence and dedication. He has missed only a handful of classes (quite literally). A very focused and determined person in general, he always puts his best into the things he does, be it academics or projects or solving assignments or helping friends. A fellow WWE and football fan (more specifically Tottenham and Suarez :P) I have really enjoyed those conversations with you about these, not to mention exchanging tales about our FIFA gaming exploits. All in all, a wonderful person to be with, a person who will surely make you cheerful and happy, a person you know you can always depend on no matter what the situation is, a truly good friend. And as Prasanth mentioned, we will all miss your pjs :D. All the best for your future, you will go a long way ahead :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sujay-muzumdar">Sujay Muzumdar</a></p>
<p>If there ever was a call for entries to Poorest Jokes Known To Humanity Award, Uppal will be one of the top contenders. The sheer volume and quality (or the lack of it) of his jokes irrespective of the time, place or topic of discussion is mind boggling. A conversation with him has the potential to provide lessons in patience and self-restraint. But once one has learnt to see past his PJing tendencies, one can see a very sincere and dedicated individual. He has been my neighbour in all EEE CDCs and his ability to give undivided attention in class is admirable. Uppal is one of those people who are not afraid to accept a lack of knowledge but will do all to acquire it. He loves doing what he is good at and absolutely hates doing something he is not so good at, no middle ground. Extremely conscious about brands and his exalted sense of vanity (something I've tried to lecture him out of, but in vain :P ). All the best for the future. And try not to get your PS station closed down from your bad jokes.  <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suhas-suraj">Suhas Suraj</a></p>
