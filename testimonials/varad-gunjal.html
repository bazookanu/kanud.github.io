title: Varad Gunjal

<h1 class="page-title">Varad Gunjal</h1><p>Varad, gimme your assignment.' I think that's mostly how most of my conversations have been with Varad at times. A constant source of inspiration, he's solely responsible for me graduating from this college. I count myself lucky 'coz I was there when a Phd-in-English prof christened him 'Varod'. Varad's good-nature has helped him in being the butt-end for most of our jokes,but he takes it with a smile and a 'bhenchod!'. Anyhoo, Varad is the kindest and smartest person I know on campus. He's helped me out on millions of occasions, be it  post-Bogmalo events or pre-compre hassles. A hater of limelight, Varad's ironically had his fair share of accolades pouring down on him like rain in the past year. There's been weeks where we've woken up and got news that another one of his million papers was read by giants at CERN or IEEE, and he's been called to visit half the places in the world. A Bogmalo and Velino legend, our hero's tryst with alcohol (abuse?) have made headlines everywhere. But beneath all the borrowed jokes and failed punchlines, is a soft-spoken, patient ,genius of a man. I can never forget his obsession with just one word every week, be it ' Chud!'  or 'bhai D!', opening his door hours later,his anna-bitching sessions and a million other things. This sarcastic thin-man's  prowess in English is unparalleled, his aversion to females disturbing, and his pile of awards and achievements not surprising. All the  music discussions, DC downloads ;) , TV shows recommendations, technology talks with Varad have made these three years truly memorable and fun. Make millions, and give us some. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nakul-santpurkar">Nakul Santpurkar</a></p>
<p>Varod ! I wish I had a pint for every paper that this guy has published.Works hard parties harder . Lives in the lab. But when he's out , is insane fun to hang out with. We've shared many things, our devotion for AB , IEEE work,  Velino trips and conning Rahul Gandhi. His adpetness in electronics is not worth mentioning since it's been amply covered. He's also cursed with tremendous bad luck , so much so that Murphy must rolling in his grave on see his plight. So V (Jinx is now called J, so I'm giving this a try ) enjoy Zurich on your shoe string budget and Cheers to your illustrious future career ! - Fungii<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>
<p>Varod Varod Varod, we got to know each other only as late as 2nd year, a year wasted, as he would agree. A prodigious talent when it comes to image processing, vlsi design and most importantly, drinking. Varod has seen his fair share of troubles, from being the first guy in our batch to be caught at the gate drunk, to being the first guy in our batch to be caught at the gate drunk, twice. Varod perpetually lives in the vlsi lab, busy with his beloved hexapod or IEEE work or just "aee meko kaamai". Hes another EEE victim but its safe to stay, we've met each other more at Velino than any EEE cdc lecture. He also loves Pink Floyd ("iluvpinkfloyd@yahoo.com"), drinking, taking sinha's case, drinking, eating (aeee kaana-kaane-kai) and drinking. On a serious note, Varod has great taste in music, he slogs his a** off doing something hes passionate about and that has won him a ticket to Zurich. Make sure you have an opening for me in your company. Cheers! Chal abhi mereko kaana-kaane-kai.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-choudhary">Aman Choudhary</a></p>
<p>"Varad? Where is he? GO LOOK FOR HIM!" - Prashant Nagpal
***
"Varad? Achcha woh? Haan haan, Bogmalo waala." - Everyone on campus
***
"Varad? Nope, never heard of him" - AAOC prof
***
"Abey my speaker broke. Fix it na" - Friend of Varad
***
"Varad bhaiyya, IEEE join kiya, ab project do na..." - Juniors
***
"Abey chutye... "
Varad, on himself

"What depraved souls we have in our country - fuckers stole a urinal!"
Varad, peeing on a tap.

I met Varad for the first time at a DePP meeting, and the first thing I heard him say was, 'Ah, so you're another one of us elite few to be chosen". The second thing I heard him say was,"Dude, I AM Borat!". Quite a first impression there, eh?

Needless to say, we've come a long way from "If you're a <insert adjective> type of person then <insert event> is the place for you" to becoming the best of friends. Varad is one of the most brilliant and insanely hard working persons I've ever come across, with exceptional proficiency in electronics and language, not to mention smashing good looks (lol jk). The sheer number of projects he's worked on and papers he's published stand testimony to this fact.

Varad has more drunken antics to his name than anyone can remember; antics which provide a starting point for the enormous amount of case-taking Varad is subjected to. (Sorry dude :P) We've spent countless hours together discussing everything and everyone under the sun, from movies and music to viral videos and memes that would come to define each semester at BITS. (We manage agree on a LOT of things, especially the list of dickheads on campus). It was thanks to Varad that I ended up at the Opeth concert in Bangalore, a brilliant end to a brilliant Bangalore trip!

Cheers and make sure you get one of those 'all you can touch' lap dances when you're in Zurich. Also, Toblerones. I lke Toblerones. And don't forget to hire us when you become India's youngest billionaire ;-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/paanini-navilekar">Paanini Navilekar</a></p>
<p>Varod Brinjal, DRDO's top man. I first heard of him (like everyone else) in sem-1 after his boat incident. I was like 'waah yaar, aate hi chaalu'. The second time I heard of him was when someone told me that Varad had burnt music on cd's and brought them to campus along with his cd-player. That led me to Varad's room and that's the first time we met. Varad is one of the few real engineers in the campus, and even though IEEE seemed like a scam to him first, he's now the president, having got himself a paid vacation in Switzerland this summer. I believe everyone who knows Varad is glad that all his hard work is paying off, and we all cant wait to mooch off him in the future. Apart from being such a genius with circuits etc, Varad is one of the best friends I've had. We've spent countless number of times sitting in my room listening to music, be it GnR, Opeth, PT, Alter Bridge, Slash, RHCP or even Lonely Island, and reflecting on our lives (his has turned out just fine). Varad has also done a lot of academic social work in these 3 years, and a lot of us owe him a few of our good grades. There have been numerous occasions where Varad has been the butt end of a lot of our jokes, but he's always taken them in his stride with a few expletives. I do not regret cracking jokes at him anyways :P. A great guy who will in all probability rake in the moolah very soon! All the Bogmalo nights and the Velind trips with him were amazing, and I thank him for introducing me to Nev's :D I really want you to go to Wacken and Oktoberfest this summer and let your steel wool hair down! Here's wishing you all the success, and hopefully a lifetime of friendship! Cheers! 

PS: Varad is not very photogenic. :P <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>

<p>I’ll say it now and I'll say it again; Varad will be the harbinger of destruction for mankind. This electronics pro will create skynet and kill us all :X. But seriously I have never seen a guy do the kind of incredible shiz Varad does. He is DRDO’s Top Man!!  His room has more electronic crap than any lab on campus. I was always excited about his projects and who he works for, how he does the things he does, but sadly it’s all classified information, we are all just insects now to him who look from a far and gape at the wonder that is Varad :( And also I’ll never see anyone have so much old monk and still be alive :o. He has the great reputation of being the guy who got lost and fell asleep near a boat. I’ll miss you man and your awesome posters, the nights in bogmalo spent bitch slapping you into consciousness. But anyways rock on and I hope you go on further and bring in the next AI revolution for all of us. I wish you all the best for your future!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shashank-acharya">Shashank Acharya</a></p>
<p>I will not start naming Varad's nicknames here, because some are stupid, some lewd and others, disturbing. The first time I talked to him was when he came up to me this one time I was wearing a Doors t-shirt and started asking me about my favourite Doors songs. Later we started chillin' together, and it was bitchin', yo! (mostly because he's so easily scandalised) There are binges, there are industrial strength binges and then there are 'our' binges - that's fairly accurate.  Knows a lot of useless trivia and for some unknown reason, hates most Indian pop-culture. We share a lurve for classic rock, horrendous TV and the desi spiderman dance. He may have won awards and all for his work, but his single largest contribution to the betterment of this country was to correctly generalise the thieves of our country as 'depraved'. What was marvellous was that he had this epiphany while peeing on a tap. He knows Pune like the back of his hand, and I hope to visit more misal-pav places with him this summer. So that's the V for you. And many years later, if you ever meet Varad and get chai-biscuit at his office, spare a glance for the person who serves you, it might just be me.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Varood! Haha, the first time i *heard* of this guy was after the (in)famous boat incident! I remember standing with Chinmay in our corridor and pointing towards Varad's room's general direction, (as if we were talking about some mythical creature) and saying "Varad's that guy who passed out on the boat in Bogmalo no?". Well not long after, i got to meet this fabled creature and whatte fun it has been! :P Varad is undoubtedly one of my closest friends and we've had many memories to cherish and some even better ones that we can't remember! :D Varad, behind his shy exterior, is an absolute genius. Be it electronics, music or booze, Varad's quite literally conquered it all. I will ALWAYS remember the EPIC Bangalore trip(s) and Varad's fascination with that glass of Glenfiddich that he was poured at my uncle's party. Varad has almost always been at the wrong end of most of our jokes and has always had it tough when it comes to the rub of the green, but his ability to get through that has been truly admirable. Varad is, and always be, an inspiration to us all. I owe him big for introducing me to Paani, Jinx and the entire Ah4-Ah5 lot. Well, all i can say is BEST OF LUCK (:P) to *hopefully* the most successful person from our lot! Cheers to a great future and long, long friendship ahead! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varun-vaswani">Varun Vaswani</a></p>
<p>PS: Such a long, strange trip its been :D. Partay is set boss !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ishaan-bhat">Ishaan Bhat</a></p>
<p>Aah Mr. Varod. Where do I start. My first proper memory (which seems to be failing me these days) of you is your epic night of fame. The conversations and planning that you induced were, to say the least, interesting. But little did I know, that the goofy Badam-like fellow we were searching for knee deep in water would be one of the most brilliant and genius minds to set foot on campus. This guy's presence in the IEEE and the electronics world in general is felt way beyond campus. I mean, he's making a six limb robot that can feel you up and map your terrain for god's sake. You really gonna mess with this guy ? 
His unnatural (yes ! it is unnatural) talent to multiply multiple digit numbers and give the answer within a second is bizarre. His undying love for classic rock is infectious, and I can proudly credit my introduction to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin (yeah, i had never really listened to them properly before) to him.  In totality, there's an insaaane amount of brain, wit and general brilliantness fused into this brinjal, and this campus should be proud to bear a very artistic chalk graffiti that Pushkar and I have to done to commemorate this genius' presence.
We've had some great times in Bogmalo, and hanging around with this guy is always fun, with his random goof-ups that we get to poke fun at, and the random wittiness that this guy exudes. I will especially never forget that binge session in Pune with him along with Ankur, jinx and tam, where this boy finally showed signs of possessing what most people call - Balls. Waah Varad, Aap toh ban gaye Marad, was the chant for the night.
I've had the honour of knowing this guy, and will cherish all the times spent with him. and these are the things I must say to enable myself to mooch off him once he becomes this god inventor and we are all at his mercy :P
Cheers Badam !! , many more Toons sessions await :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aseem-patil">Aseem Patil</a></p>
<p>Easily one of the most intelligent people I know. Dude, you have this really bad-ass brain and the best part is, you are putting it to good use. You are not only good at implementing ideas but you have a knack of coming up with awesome ones too. What you've achieved so far is beyond anyone's capability. 
Every time we meet, you are either getting back from the lab, going to the lab, or you are at bogmalo (:D). You are one of the most hard working people I know, you never get bored of what you do and you more than deserve everything you've achieved. 
And to top this, you have a great sense of humor. AAOC courses were the only ones that were actually fun to study, thanks to you, TB and the gang. 
I hope you come up with the most insane ideas soon (you're already on your way though) and the first thing you do is include me in these. Heh! Wish you the very best.

<p>I guess I'm one of the few people who first met and heard of Varad in a non-alcoholic manner. Our friendship began with Pink Floyd. I still remember his enthusiasm as he listed out some of the best titles from my favourite albums. I remember thinking that this guy must be a really good storyteller. He's got some real passion. On that front, I was horribly wrong. Varad's stories have this habit of starting somewhere promising and then... well after that you just smile and wave as it passes you by. Still, we've had some crazy conversations. Especially the ones during CDC exam time :). Although we somehow always managed to bring it back to Mane, didn't we? Don't let this guy fool you though. His fuck-my-life attitude and loose rock T-shirts are all just a front. He's actually one of the most brilliant and hard-working geniuses I've ever met. This  ex-IEEE president has published more papers than I care to remember. In my opinion he is the most succesful person in this campus, and will be one of the most succesful innovators to grace this planet. He's been an awesome friend and a frustrating study partner.And one day as he launches his hexapod into space from where it wil discover an alien species preparing to take over the Earth, DRDO will call upon him to save us all. Anyway, best of luck man. You'll go far. .. just  set the controls for the heart of the Sun :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dhruva-t-b">Dhruva T B</a></p>
