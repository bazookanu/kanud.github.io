<h1 class="page-title">Vardhan Thakar</h1><p>One word that most aptly describes him is unpredictable. He is adventurous, outgoing, lives in the moment, always ready to try new things and follows "take lite" philosophy a bit too diligently.  He will always be ready to go along with any plan, any trip. He has been a very devoted member of the backstage (yes the backstage's efforts are not always appreciated, but mate you have done a lot :) ). He also happens to be a brilliant footballer, the biggest fan of F.R.I.E.N.D.S that I have ever seen, and a true gunner (Now, that the cesc-curse has been 
lifted, you might actually win a trophy soon :P).
<p>
Here's a toast to all those infinite hours spent quoting F.R.I.E.N.D.S with vazz and dandoos, the discussions on football, the awesome football matches and of-course the awesome trips to bog(finding answers to the life, the universe and everything :D). I wish I had come earlier ;). Best wishes for your future mate, and keep that wild streak alive. I also hope that you will be lucky enough to say the right name, nobody will be drunk, nobody will be gay, and on your first try !!! :D
<p><p>
P.S : To the bog ;)

<p>Birdya :D Vardhan is a very friendly, talented, athletic and enthusiastic person. His trademark responses are "Exactly!!!" , and "Modak, de taali!" Vardhan is a easy going, sporty person. I've had some really funny time with him back at Backstage. Man! We'll never forget the day we transported an all-line speaker on a Dio-with Mr. Zakir trying to be smart in front of his son :-G .Vardhan is always ready to help, have some fun, and one of the best guys to have a chat with. He has an amazing grasping power, with rock solid concepts. There's a tankfull of potential energy just waiting to be converted to kinetic. He is an amazing footballer, and doesnt care even if he injures himself (though he should care). And yes. There was this simply amazing time , with Vardhan and Dhannu-location: Exam hall :D All the best Birds!! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Vardhan is one of my Best Friends. I would do anything  for this guy. He has made sure I go for my class every morning. Reason being my mom calling him to wake me up. See the mimicry there. We have bruised each other scolded each other and have had copious amounts of laughter( amongst other things) day and night. At the moment I am using his comp to write thiatestimonial. I wonder what I will do without him....Cheers to you Vardhan the Old Monk.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/edwin-abraham">Edwin Abraham</a></p>
