<h1 class="page-title">Varun Ahuja</h1><p>The cool eco senior ! :D
He is one of the very few people whom i met on the campus in the very first week. I will never forget that ragging cos it was so damn fun and the very first trailer of what life on our campus is like! :D a little casinova like ( don't mind ohkay :P) but and an awesome friend and a great guy who will always be there if you need any help. Not to forget the amount of hardwork he has put in to take Spree 2012 to new heights. Very professional in his outlook when it comes to work and also encourages drinking in the true spirit of DOSM! I like that about him!  Haha.
Keep in touch :)
PS-I will never be able to thank him enough for that "call me MAD-E" joke. It still does piss her off B-)

<p>I came to know you well mainly in my third year though we had common tuitions in +1 and +2.And then how you would try to take my case occasionally and try to fool me into believing the fake"group rule book" :P(which i never bought by the way :P).Then the outings- the baga trip and the nightout being the memorable ones, have been the epic moments of my life.I acknowledge and appreciate your quality of not judging your friends by frivolous stupid things(which many people do) , your dedication towards the departments you are a part of and the fact that you live your life in a true spirit.Its definitely not a time to bid farewell to you as we have many more awesome and memorable outings to come in the next year :D.All the best for all your future endeavours though :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>
<p>Well thou we haven't hang out that much I have had some of my best experiences on campus with you- be it be the first self drive or the epic Mahabaleshwar trip (\m/), grilling the paneer tikka and hand painting at Mc Donald's.The best part is that you are non-vegetarian(why m I always stuck with vegetarians?). One thing I really appreciate about you is that you don't take anything to the heart.Keep up the attitude, enjoy life like you already do and have fun.All the best for everything ahead. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>
<p>Varun! Ab tere bare mein kya hi likhein hum. It won;t be enough and it will sound very formal. But well, let’s give it a shot!
[Which reminds me, I miss having shots at Bogmalo with you! :D ]
I remember when I saw you for the first time, you, obviously, reminded me of your look-alike senior. Beyond that, I don’t remember how we got talking and all I recall is you being one who I could call up at any point of time, knowing that you’ll be there in the next 2 minutes. 
It was great working with you, especially with your ideas and with you having a knack of getting work out of people and winding up things without any un-necessary delays. You have this tendency to take up a lot of work on yourself and do a pretty good job out of it.
Taking up DoSM, I never imagined I would be left with an amazing set of friends, and in retrospect, it was the best thing to have happened to me on campus. I miss having all the advisory, chatty and gossip sessions with you – getting obsessed with really silly stuff, now that I think back. 
I know for a fact that I can always count on you, no matter what. Keep up your lively spirit and your ever-ready mood to go out and party! All the very best for life! You’ll surely do a brilliant job. :D
God Bless!
Cheers! [I hope we get to do the actual one soon enough!]

<p>Thaath, you are the definition of that word. Always walking with head held high, filled with confidence and optimism. Add an awesome smile to that and you have Varun Ahuja.  Farsighted and Workaholic, result of which was a marvelous Spree 2012. He makes you work your ass off, but then sees to it that you party harder. Some people run the race, he makes his own roads. May you overcome the toughest challenges life throws at you because I know an easy life will bore the shit out of you. All the best, keep smiling :)

<p>Ahujaaa, the dude ! I dont know if u remember , but you were the 1st few few people who had ragged me, never the less, it was fun , near ch4/3 seats :D .. 
over the years, i have got a lot closer to you . You where an awesome mentor for me in DoSM . Initially , i thought you were loading me with lot of work, but then eventually, it helped me a lot, Got to learn so many things with you ! I love your passion and the dedication to the work you put in, which was very evident from the time you became the spree co-ordintor. Although I wasnt a part of the spree, but knew about it from the team !
It was awesome to be your junior and learn n get work from you ! may you achieve great success in life . Looking forward to work with you again in the future ! and keep the smile and cash rolling :) :)
