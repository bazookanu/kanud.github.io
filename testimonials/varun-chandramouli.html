<p>The PRO-est AOE player on the campus.. and at the same time equally great in Acads.. A very simple humble determined person ...he doesnt give a flying fuck about whatever things happen around him except gaming and acads...  One of the least socialising people i know..which ultimately works out in his advantage :P He's very helpful.. teaches me almost everythign that i ask for....after acting like a total prick for sometime... Wish you best of luck for future.. !

<p>Varun-popularly known as i-con, nakali, PanDa and also the lagger......the pillar of our Dot(later renamed as 3p!c) clan...i came to know him in 2nd sem as we both shared our mutual interest for Age of Empires.....a superb guy with a great sense of humour and has an amazing ability to enact others(be it CS profs or our fellow friends)...this guy has immense self control(the first time he visited Bogmalo is a few days back thats in our third year) and manages time very efficiently(juggling b/w acads, football and gamning).....a crazy lunatic 
about watching and following football, a person who has a unique laugh.....lights the room with his presence........college life would have been incomplete without you br0........all the best for your future....keep in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sarang-shamshery">Sarang Shamshery</a></p>
<p>Yo nakli! Insane AOE player who would give you the chills if you see him playing sometime. You can't even follow what you see on the screen and let alone understand what he might even be thinking. Very focused and determined person who has his goals set and unwavering. Extremely good in academics and a very good friend. Very humble and friendly who would always be ready to help in whatever way he can. We will never forget our train trips during semester holidays. His usual comment, "Nahin bataunga", was sometimes irritating but with the right timing usually lightens up the mood and most frequently trolls entra. Man, you just had to be in AH6, huh? Damn that special lunch.
May you achieve the heights that you aspire for, Best of Luck!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/siddharth-sourav-sahoo">Siddharth Sourav Sahoo</a></p>
<p> i-con is one hell of an aoe player. I have seen him defeat 4 players single-handedly(not sure whether it was because he was that good or because the others were noobs) without breaking a sweat. Extremely friendly and humble he helps out anyone who asks him for help in acads. One of the few people who plays games nearly throughout the night but still has a 9 smthg cg. During exam days he goes and wakes half the people of our corridor, without him some people wouldn't write their exams. He is one heck of a lazy guy who loves staying in his room and playing 24/7. Other than all this he is a fun person to hang out with and also a die hard arsenal fan. Wishing you all the best for your future and keep in touch

<p>Varun aka i-con aka Panda aka lagger is one of the best AOE players in Campus, DOT clan would have lost to mallus without u :P .He basically taught us noobs how to play aoe. Guess he is the only gamer apart from Nambi who is good at acads. He one of very few Arsenal fans in our hostel, but he doesnt watch any match, fearing he'll jinx it :D. A die hard A-mess fan (now that hes shifting to CH1 , Amess bhi shift ho raha hai). We had some really awesome times together, be it some imba AOE/DOTA games, or just the regular pit stop at your room while leaving or entering the hostel. All the best for the future... stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/param-prabhu-alvenkar">Param Prabhu Alvenkar</a></p>
<p>At last i am writing this testimonial just hours before the deadline ( lazy me ). I first got to hear about Varun from someone as the guy living in the opposite corridor who challenged my claim ( oh god! why did i claim ) as the greatest fan of our chemistry teacher, after which both of us got christened as panda (a/n). Since that day we have faced a lot ( lectures, ps, cop ) together. Now, as in a testimonial one is supposed to enlist the qualities of the person, i'd do that. Varun is a person who is really passionate about LAN gaming and is one of the best AOE players in the campus and recently took up DOTA ( which i think he plays decent enough ). He is one of the few people who are die hard gamers and are still good at acads. This i will attribute to his excellent gaming sense and the power of assimilating a large amount of trash information in a small amount of time. He is someone who starts late for any exams and still is able to understand the finer details of the topic ( or at least tries to do that all the time ). All these things point to the fact that he is immensely talented ( he is, but hardly uses it anywhere except gaming and studies < only a bit here>) but he refuses to accept it ( because he has a 'heart of gold' :P). He has got a very cool and balanced attitude about life which over the years i have come to appreciate. I don't think that i would have been able to do my PS-I as smoothly ( not so smooth, but good enough ) as it went had he not helped me out with language issues ( which i realised when i had to travel back alone and i could not figure which to take ). And i would also like to thank him for keeping the spirit high while doing the assignments and project ( don't know what is between him and projects <both PS and cop> ) and for introducing ( teaching, precisely )me to AOE.
Now, as all of this comes to an end i would like to wish you all the best for your future. And i hope that we stay in touch after the college.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kunwar-kanishk-singh">Kunwar Kanishk Singh</a></p>
