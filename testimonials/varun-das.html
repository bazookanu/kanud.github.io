<h1 class="page-title">Varun Das</h1><p>vrooooom das, vazz or u can call him an idiot, doesn't really matters :P. One of the very first person with whom i interacted just after coming to campus. For some reason he feels hungry at the nights and then bugs me for food but that has stopped now since the past one year or so. Tall or may be taller than what you will think by me just saying tall. But doesn't knows the difference between Baath and baat :P. Its really not easy to make out when is he actually serious and when he is just pretending to be serious but nevertheless a great friend to have. adds a lot of flavor to the group and his saste pjs can scale epic heights at times. All the best buddy, stay in touch even after this stint at campus is over :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
<p>A calm two dimensional giant (Are you the tallest guy in the Campus?) :D .. One of the coolest guys around and carries that aura with him wherever he goes. A pro-gamer ,genius coder and an awesome cricketer. Passionate about Music ( LP \m/),Current Affairs (_/\_ Knowledge), Movies , T V series(Can not hear anything against Prison break and believe me I have had to bear that brunt in almost every conversation :D) and football.Famous for his classic one-liners like:"Kaun he be??" and "Thu Tho lite Hi Le". His room is always full of people (movies,maggi,gaming ,studying and what not)and has been a host of amazing times over the past 3 years.Glued to his phone and messaging ( :D) (Also know as Vodafone Vazz) The most  caring guy in the group. Always comes forward and stands for his friends. An outgoing personality ...loves adventures and trips..(The night out this sem was \m/ \m/....)..
Really proud to be your friend and have a happy and a successful life.... :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-r-bellubbi">Akash R Bellubbi</a></p>
<p>His towering frame is the first thing you notice about Varun. We share a lot of things in common ranging from being hardcore Arsenal fans to being FRIENDS fanatics. He is a true Gunner and a big football fan and would not miss a single Arsenal game. He takes keen interest in all the current events ans loves to discuss and debate them. He has clear thoughts about what he wants in life and has a very sorted-out mind. He appreciates the smaller things in life. He is simplicity personified. His motto is always to enjoy what you do in your life. You may call him a purist(being an Arsenal fan makes it even more apt). Your presence shall be thoroughly missed after a few days. Hopefully in the future we will never give a chance of catching up on a an Arsenal match with a jug of chilled beer.... I have no doubt that you are going to have a great future...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anurag-dandekar">Anurag Dandekar</a></p>

<p>Varun Das a.k.a VD/Vroom/Vazz. He is Mr.too cool. Seriously, could this guy <b>BE</b> any more cool !?<p>
Vroom as he is called by certain loved ones ;), is a very pragmatic, amusing, level-headed yet a child-at-heart guy. He loves hanging out with people, is more of a outgoing kind and will be ever-ready to go on a trip. He enjoys everything to the fullest. He is a true gunner and a huge F.R.I.E.N.D.S aficionado. His bucket list includes being spectator in a match at the Emirates, and living life friends' style. He is always in touch with the latest happenings around the world and takes great interest in current affairs. His expertise on graphs and networks is second to none. However, for all his virtues, he does have a knack for cracking god-awful pathetic pjs. Some jokes so bad that you would want to get that flash-stick from MIB and zap away your memories of the past few minutes. But still, for all his wretched attempts at humour he has managed to stay as one of my closest friends. I believe you are one guy that I have great understanding with. There has always been so much to talk about, the himym, friends, soft-rock and off late cdcs. I would never agree with you on Bourne Triology, and you would never agree on the awesomeness of hp and anime/manga and other fantasy genre. He is too mature to watch Harry Potter :P. 
<p><p>
There have been far too many hilarious experiences to keep count of. Still, here's a toast to that epic trip to Banglore (should have come on the second one), to that trip to Mangalore & Jog falls which was nothing short of Legend-wait.for.it-dary, to the \m/ bog jaunts, to the Curlies', and to all the immensely hilarious experiences shared over past 3 years. Best wishes man, the Lord of the rains(is it?) :P. Stay in touch always :). There will always be time for a drink with a friend. <i>:awkward hug:</i> ;)

P.S - Tu toh ek aur sem yahi hai, and then PS bhi hopefully saath mein hi hoga. So its pretty early to wave you off. I have atleast another year to hear your terrible jokes :D. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
<p>VD!!!!!!!!............if u see the tallest creature walking in shorts even from miles away..........u can be sure it is Varun.............he is one guy whom i love having duels with?.........a simple, jovial person at heart........but also a big time casanova :P........for the 1st 2 years i have never seen him leave his mobile even for a minute........he’ll multi task and talk to you while typing :P........when you see him,heseems like a very  chilled out guy but actually he tries to give a macho impression of himself :P (mere comments aur posts fb se delete kar ke tera society mein status nahi badhega :x )............i will not be surprised even if you delete this testimonial :P............a die hard football and ARSENAL  fan.........never the one to miss out on any of their matches............ a really really good friend........times spent with him are indeed memorable be it discussing something or his awful attempts at PJs :P.......but still he has a good sense of humour........his knowledge on current affairs is simply brilliant............a pro gamer and quite a hardworking student..........even after 3 years he is so disciplined, that you will find his lights off before 11.30 and never one day have i seen him get up late...........watches too many movies,tv series and loud music is always blaring from his room.............one of the biggest critics of bollywood movies you’ll find  and always attempting sarcastic comments on them :P.......always be in touch ..........all the best for your future:)

<p>Varun was my first kanada-speaking friend but somehow, its been 3 yrs now and we have never really conversed in that language! We speak in a different language... fifa,cricket,bogmalo ....the list is endless. The casinova that he is ,he never forgets to give those valuable tips to all of us. He is perennially pre-occupied with his mobile, texting away to his fans in different cities. We could call him the chief spokesperson for Msc(tech) Information Systems, and at any time of the year he is ready with 10 reasons why IS rocks \m/ . His anecdotes are interesting and thus perhaps everytime any1 is bored, his room is a common recreational spot. He is generally the highest supplier of munching stuff, wen he is back from home. There are also those maggi moments ;) MUSIC on his speakers is the best thing in the world. He is one of those guys who enjoys  his cdcs and throws the rest of the subjects in the bin. Im sure thats gonna take you a long way. Keep rocking! Ur awesome.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anuj-rao">Anuj Rao</a></p>
