<h1 class="page-title">Varun Tak</h1><p>I haven't known Varun for so long but i still feel that like i know him better than most of my friends .. Varun gives you this kind of feeling. I was introduced to him when i heard a late night ruckus outside my room and then i joined the grp and time just flew by...
I have known Varun in all his states of mind ... well there are only 2 --sober and drunk and well he is fun to hangout with in both the cases.
He is a great guy, full of life, ever-ready to enjoy and have a good time and make others around him feel the same.
He has gr8 knowledge of CS ... and enjoys doing fun-stuff with it. He is my one stop portal to all the campus news and l8est happenings
Its hard to get bored with him ... we have had some memorable all-nighters 
My forever NC buddy .... I know you have a gr8 & successful life ahead of  you and I am wishing you best of luck for it
Never my Junior, always my friend
Yours truly,
Sameer

<p>Varun aka Kach-chha, a person you always want to be friends with. He likes to joke with friends aur phir sab gala phaad ke haste hain :D :D, very smart in pulling lags (5 mins mein aisi khelta hai _/\_) . He is very supportive, cool bindaass, he is not at all envious of anyone. Aur bechare Amit ko jane kya kya imagine karwata hai. We have spent infinite moments together, going to night cateens, mess, outings and all THE THILVAYIEE outside AH4, waiting for bus. I am going to miss him a lot. You can never get bored in his presence. He won’t let you be. We had awesome outings. Remember, we made six IP of AH4 banned from DC. Tune dil pe le lia and admin bann gya ,bahut sahi. :D :D. His patience is incomparable. (aaj tak 3 saal mein bus nahi aayi but abhi bhi bahar wait karta hai. :P :D ).  Usse jo karna who kar hi deta hai ( 1st feb wala idea jo  tha _/\_ ).  I can describe him by a single statement “Banda yeh BINDASSS hai ”. He will surely make his dreams come true.  Wish you a good life ahead :-). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akash-sharma">Akash Sharma</a></p>
<p>Tak, as I like to call him is a genuine person who is always their for his loved ones. Though I was aquaintance with him since my 2-2, in BITSAA, but got to know him properly in my 3-2. A great friend, he lives life on his own terms. Some people who don't know him properly may mistake him for a person with extremes but once you get to know him, you'll know how wrong you were in the 1st place. Doston ka Doston & Yaaron ka Yaar. Don't mistake me when I write Dost and Yaar as these are two very different terms which I guess Varun, you exactly know. Extremely talented, loves to work hard on things he likes, else takes too lite. Going to PS this sem, will be back in his 4-2, I wont be here so i'll definitely miss those night discusions which went on from 1-4 in the mornings many a times. The best one was the thing outside C mess (remember :P). I hope you get everything you want. Have a great way ahead and call me when you feel like :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mohit-batra">Mohit Batra</a></p>
<p>Kacchhhaaa! One of the most “outgoing” people from our group, Kacchhaa is someone unique. He is a brand in himself. Uske jaisa duniya mein aur koi nahi milega… he lives life over a gamut of emotions, and can be quite deceiving most of the times. Yet there’s another personality of Varun Tak, where he just flows, just goes with the flow, when the friend in him suddenly overcomes every other persona, and then he talks things u can only imagine, and u know ki bas whatever may be the case, ye banda kitna hi bada ch@#$ya ho, hai to bahot mast yaar. Bas that’s it about Varun, he’s just mast! Kabhi bhi tension ho, kuch bhi ho, agar wo aas paas hai, aur wo apne “aaj toh main ekdum bade buzurgon ki tarah rahunga” waale mode mein nah o, toh gajjab maze kara deta hai. He just talks, and is soooo spontaneous in them, that u just wonder ki yaar ye kaise kar pata hoga! Baaki bakchodi kara lo tum isse jitni karwani hai, banda haazir ho jayega jab bolo tab. NC ke bahot bade fan rahe hain, aur once more, friendship ko bahot value karte hain, uske matter mein kabhi bakwaas nhi karta, aur values bhi kaafi high rakhta hai apne frnds ke liye.
Personally, me and Varun have shared a great camaraderie since our first year, when I knew him other only though the common room, as an AH4 ghuspaithiya! :P Second sem mein Quark and then mere group mein lane mein bhi kaafi “instrumental” raha tha. In fact maine toh socha tha, jaha ek hi banda itnneee level ka fodu hai, sab milenge toh bas life toh jhakass ho jayegi! And trust me, ho gayi! Second year toh epic raha tha… mujhe ek baar sirjee ne inspire kar diya tha padhne ke liye (wo baat alag hai saala ab tak uske credits maangta rehta hai :P), fir ek raat ko toh aise tension mein the, eksum zindagi khatam ho gayi types(haan as I said, wo kabhi kabhi apne serious mode mein chale jaata hai) Fir third year mein Waves ke liye bhi bahot support raha hai, hamesha bolta rehta tha, kabhi kuch bhi kaam ho bata dena launde, macha dena hai waves ko toh.. He has this style of talking to frnds like he owns them, wo tumhare liye ekdum badhiya cheez bolega, but order karega, “beta, waves ko machaya nahi na, toh bachega nahi!” We have had our “dosti ki feel nahi aa rahi moments”, but then I guess that’s how we are so much better friends today! Thanks for being there! And always do so! :D

<p>This 6 year old yaari started when I met him in FIITJEE, Punjabi Bagh - a godforsaken place which had to be visited every 2nd day for the promise of "forget IITJEE". It would have been unbearable (and worth bunking), if I hadn't encountered him, along with a "bull", an "odiya", a "budha" and many more. Together, we demonstrated a perfect example of being back-benchers (or black benchers of the class, analogy to black sheep of the family). Together we bird-watched, mocked the front ones as well as the teachers, invented non-veg jokes, ate patties at "mother dairy" and wasted the "worthy 4 hours" of the day. Quizzes were the best part as it was both of us, who introduced the concept of "quiz-fixing". Together we also resisted the dandas of SSK, which were more unbearable than british lathi charge. It was us who were in bottom list of faculty expectations and it was us only who defied everyone expectations. He should have come to BITS Goa an year earlier. However, it hardly made any difference. The way he made friends with the seniors is probably the fastest record made by any junior :D. It was like FIITJEE memories coming back. He is mentally and emotionally strong because not even once I have seen this guy lose heart and crib even in the direst of situations. He got into many clubs and departments and played an important role there too. Even after being a senior for over two years, this guy is still the "angry young man" who wants to bring change and age hasn't cooled him yet. Along with the great sense of humor, his character can be best glorified with his honesty. Be it a senior or a junior, a teacher or a student, old or young, whatever he speaks is truth and so honestly, it would make gandhi cry. He will criticize or praise the person if he/she actually deserve it. As for the academics, he is IS God. He is one of the rare guys who doesn't care what grades he gets in exams and focuses more on practical knowledge which is the demand of the real world right now. He is one of the most lively figures in the campus of dead. He was probably the only first year who said "bumboo ho gaya" and laughed when he really messed up his tests. We would still remember the long night outs spent in AH6, night canteen and even at the footpaths :D. It was because of you, Kashmiri and JAVA were able to wake up the whole night and Anna was able to spend his "happy hour" outside his room. Tak, tu ladkion par aone paintare try kar, khoob pankhe bana lega ;). You also have been such a fine council that if I were the king of Westeroes and iron throne, I would have made you my hand.

<p>vrrooonn aka kancha is one the rarest person I have ever met. A incredible friend, amazing company, a friend u can look up to for any help at any point of time. I met this guy during registration, where started  advising me about choosing teachers as if he had done it thousands of time :P. I realized  immediately that he is a phodu but didn’t  thought that after 3 years he will so special to me. We had a kick ass start to our college life, doing all sorts of non-conventional  things( including goofy walk on lover’s lane :P).  During these 3 years many things changed, all of us had our lows and highs, but our  six men army( or 5 men & 1 pongoose :P) remained the same and I am sure it will remain forever.
You need advices..you go to him !!
You need to go to NC..you go to him!! :P
You need to laugh..you need to go to him !!
You need to talk about something that is troubling you..you definitely need to go to him !!
He is that one guy who doesnt care about a lot of things  but once he care about something or someone then  “ No one does it better”.
Iski Spontaneity ka to jawab nhi…kuch bhi incident ho iske paas hamesha koi na koi analogy hoti hi hai and jab nhi hoti hai to aisi banata hai ki sunne wala kahega “ saala itna soch kaise leta hai”. He is fun to be around with and has a amazingly pleasant personality. And very less know that he also plays drums and I hope you continue that ;-)
I definitely have missed infinite things about you , about times we have spent together, about laughs we have shared, about moments that I will always cherish but I think its impossible to mention all of them here. So here’s to the journey we had and journey ahead….May u prosper in everything you do.. :-)
