<h1 class="page-title">Varun Vaswani</h1><p>Vaaaaaassss!!!!! What a guy!! He is a certifiable genius. This guy makes studying, football and looking cool look ridiculously simple. A man of so many talents that the entire Melange doesn't have enough space for them.

Have an awesome career buddy, you deserve it.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sushan-maitra">Sushan Maitra</a></p>
<p>Varun Vaswani a.k.a  “Vaas”,a dude in every sense of the word,an exclusive personality and an ace footballer  he fills the air around him with joy and laughter .A  really  charming guy,he always keeps his cool.His distinct panche and flamboyance makes him inmitable.A person whom everybody  loves to have as a friend..<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhishek-tripathi">abhishek tripathi</a></p>
<p>Vaswani aka Vaasu, undoubtedly the Coolest Dude on Campus!, this person can aptly be described in no more than two words 'Pure Awesome'. I met him first on the football  field (kicked his a** !..well... literally), but since then we have gone on to have great times, may it be at manipal, bangalore or very own bogmalo!  An amazing footballer,  he is also the best futsal player in BPGC. Also budding sports writer its commendable how Vaasu also manages his acads!. Trust me, You're gonna make it big, brother!, and ya do remember, Party Abhi Baaki Hai ! :D

<p>Well, what can I say. A certain email, a certain staircase in Delhi, a certain bearded builder and his brother. We've seen it all haven't we? It has been a pleasure. See you next semester, new neighbour. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>The 'coolest dude' of our batch, Vaas always has a grin (not a smile, but a grin) on his face, and spending a few minutes with him is enough to lift your mood (Especially when he shows up outside your room in the middle of a disastrous T1 and drags you to the night canteen.) His laugh is instantly recognizable and very, very infectious.
One of my closest friends on campus, Vaas introduced me to Russel Peters and ensured that phrases such as 'fantaastic', 'tooo good', 'take it...and go' became a part of our lingo.  He always has (really good) stuff to eat in his room, yet he's ever ready to visit the night canteen. He pioneered our insanely awesome Bangalore trip and convinced us the Bangalore was THE place to be for PS II. (Let's hope that works out!)
The most well known aspect of Vaas is that he's a sports junkie, being a star player of the college football and an upcoming sports journalist. (Though I have to confess, I haven't read any of your posts completely; I can't relate to them :P)

<p>Vaswani is a textbook nice guy, a rare breed of people on campus. Always laughing like a jackass at the worst of jokes, we have been involved in futile attempts at scoring chicks at Bogmalo, although he did get close to lucky one time when I wasn't there. Arguably the best futsal player our college has right now, Vaswani also writes well when it comes to football. Insane memories of the Bangalore trip, where Vaswani was self-appointed guide. Vaswani also tends to have his blonde moments both in real life and on social networks, but it's all good at the end of the day, I guess.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Oh, I forgot. THIS. IS. GUDGAAAAAAAAVAAAAAAAN.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ajinkya-kulkarni">Ajinkya Kulkarni</a></p>
<p>Vaaaaaaas!!! The greatest guy on campus (according to a recent poll :P) Of course I keed. Vaas is the person I am going to miss the most, his goofy way of sliding past our doors like a kid, his comic expression of surprise to something dumb I said, the awesome stories about his lab adventures and mishaps, his loud laugh and his wonderful priceless advice about a thousand different things I can’t even begin to list. An incredible football player on the field and also on the comp :P He is an inspiring character, watching Vaas on the field is an awesome experience. He is an animal on the field, his game is so incredible he could make a team of crones hope for victory . An incredible coder who has a natural talent for design and innovation, he also has a great amount of zeal and an incredible hunger for success, independence and nc food. Vaas please never change and be the same happy guy who spreads joy everywhere he goes… I hope you set up your own company like you always wanted give out your business cards soon that read 'I'm CEO, Bitch!'<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shashank-acharya">Shashank Acharya</a></p>
<p>Vaasu! It's so sad to leave you(r) behind and go away. I don't remember when we first met, but  I vaguely remember you telling me your mom was practically bengali. Anyway, got to know you pretty well pretty soon, and soon enough, peals of vaswani laughter pervaded our common rooms and corridors. He's an insanely fun and funny guy, and although 2-diemnsional in appearence, he is multi-dimensional in talents. One must employ slow-mo cameras to detect him on the futsal court.  I'll miss the trademark 'Bhattez!' greeting, and the pedophile smile that forever lingers on his face. This man's always been the charmer. The bangalore trip was insane man. We should do it again. Oh and, if you want to bunk with us during PS, we won't make you clean the dishes like pranky. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arka-bhattacharyya">Arka Bhattacharyya</a></p>
<p>Vassuuuu- the k3wlst d3wd of our batch. I first saw you at the basketball court during Pre-Spree'09 when you had left everybody in awe with your awesome skills. Always has been a delight to watch you on the football and futsal fields. And well, off it you are one of the best story-tellers I know. " Duuuuuuuuuude, did you see that? It was insaaaaaaane" or " Duuuuude, she asked me to staayyy." :P. The way you tell stuff you can make even a certain "someone's" tap-ins sound awesome. An ardent United fan, I am a big fan of your articles  as well, and love your score predictions( most of which never come close to reality). A drunk Vaswani gets into his "Dude, I love you" mode and his fun to hang out with.  And stop ridiculing Gurgaon please. You know its the best thing that could have happened to you, High time you accept it. Haryana ki Jai.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anubhav-sapra">Anubhav Sapra</a></p>
<p>Vaas.Stepover. That's how it is. You see him coming your way, and you get nutmegged. That's how he goes. He is undoubtedly one of the most natural footballers I've witnessed. It's been an absolute blast playing Futsal alongside him, and I hope we get many more opportunities to play together. Apart from being a dedicated football fan, he's also one of the most light-hearted and fun-loving people I know, and it's always blizzard of nonsensical jokes when he's around. Everytime he presents himself, it's so much fun doing the tip-toed wriggly finger hand shake ! :D
There's no doubt he's the 'Coolest Dude' ;) of our batch. Multi-talented as he is, he's also very creative and some of his business ideas are MindBlashting ! Like Tope said, I hope you get a "I'm CEO, bitch" card soon. I shall then proceed to get myself a "I'm piling on the CEO, bitch" card.
I hope you make it out of ze NCR/Haryaan alive and unraped... As for now, Whatsup Neighbour ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aseem-patil">Aseem Patil</a></p>
<p>Vaas, without a shadow of a doubt, the coolest dude on the campus and one of my closest friends. It's been a hell of a ride with him in the last 3 years. Got to know him a little late in the first semester, but he's been laughing at whatever nonsense i say ever since.He's one of the best football/futsal players in the campus till date, and its been awe-inspiring to see how he's worked on his game through the years. Vaas also has been someone who shares my brand of sense of humour and we've spent numerous amount of hours laughing at hypothetical 'what-if' scenarios, and everything else in general. You always know something that does not concern us is going down when he slides past your door, brakes, and then runs back in shouting 'PUSHKAAAAR! I HAVE to tell you this!' Always jolly, there's not a dull moment with him around, and now that he's in Gurgaon, the sexay times will happen :P We've also sent out mails on behalf of our friends, and maybe we're writing testimonials too, who knows? :P Anyways, all the best for all future endeavours, and i'm probably going to be the first one there when you celebrate with all the money you're going to make :P Here's to a lifetime of yepicness :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pushkar-srivatsal">Pushkar Srivatsal</a></p>
<p>Vaaas! Women want to be with you,Men want to be you.
Met this bugger when he stepped foot into the hostel, asking directions to his room,and we've been friends ever since. This guy, is undoubtedly, one of the greatest friends I have ever had. His football skills are legendary, his happiness highly infectious. I'm not going to keep describing how everyone loves him for his charm, selflessness,sportsmanship, innate-Bangaloreness, etc. For three years, Vasu has been a complete contrast to my view of the world,and my beliefs.We owe it him for adding 'DUUUDE!, and 'insane shit!' to our vernacular. We've spent countless hours discussing our completely contrasting life-styles,ideologies, and his perspective has helped me broaden my own. His attitude towards life is so new and brilliant, its captivating. I shall always miss his standing outside my door and shouting 'Hobbses, Hoooooobbbsss' in a baritone, and the daily breakfast routines of 3-2. Be it him and Pushkar analysing shit, writing stupid emails, him defending all the stupid Hindi soppy films he loves, his love for Emma Watson, his screwing up our WallStreet prize,or the countless times he's been the sober-man at Bogmalo, we're going to miss his instant goofiness and Godfather-ness. I'll remember the countless times we've all spent in my room or Tope's discussing life beyond college, people-bitching, TV Shows,twitter, women,tech ,whatnot. Its been an absolute pleasure these three years,Vaasman,and thanks for everything!

<p>Vaas was a fresh dose of Bangalore(!) in an otherwise insular corridor. It was a stroke of luck that I got cool neighbors like him & Gangal. Vaas cannot be uncool to save his life. He was actually denied an account on the Melange site because the server could crash under his testimonials. So naturally I was thrilled to have the opportunity to learn from the master. In 2 semesters I was up to date with all the gossip I had missed in 5+ years of school. And unlike most, Vaas was nice enough to patiently answer my retarded questions on girls and social life. He’s very passionate about things-be it football, drinking (dude, INSAAANE night!), entrepreneurship and of course, Bangalore.  Here’s to making a million… rupees next sem!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chinmay-deshpande">Chinmay Deshpande</a></p>
<p>I don’t think I’m ever gonna miss Varun Vaswani - ‘cause over these years, he’s become such a close friend and confidante that I know I’ll actively make efforts to keep in touch with him and meet him every now and then. Another fellow 2-D character, I actually got to know about him from Sinha (which is retarded since he lived on my floor) – who was waxing eloquent about Vaas’ football skills. And when Sinha talks about anyone other than himself in football, you know the guy’s gotta have something special. This guy is one of the most insanely gifted and passionate footballers I’ve ever seen - effing invincible on the field. Of course, the ability to score does not restrict itself to the field. His charm, easy confidence and magnetic personality are legendary – of course, the sporadic and well-documented blonde moments tend to tarnish that reputation. But I’m one to talk about reputation. Moving on, Vaas has got this trademark booming infectious laugh and a general aura of happiness about him and a refreshingly positive outlook to life – enough to lift anyone’s spirits, mine mostly. Then, of course, there’s the endless tirade of nonsensical jokes & nigga-style talk – but it’s the shizzle, yo! A trip to Bangalore is never complete without him. This ever-effervescent character, who has now been uprooted to Gurgaon, will forever be a Bangalorean at heart. He gets positively orgasmic while talking about the city and was namma guide for both the yepic trips I’ve had. I still recall my first Bangalore trip when I wreaked havoc in his house. I don’t know what was more funnier – me calling up his house and asking for Vaas in a house full of Vaswanis, or the inordinate number of times I swore when his folks were around, or that delicious cake his mum baked or me prancing up the stairs after having had a glass of scotch and making a general fool of myself in front of his parents. I’ll forever cherish memories his sliding past my door like a cartoon character with a comic music routine to boot, our MT-1 lab sessions, his and Pushkar’s antics, his exasperation for my meme obsessions and us troubling Tope, only to be thrown out with, “Bahar niklo, harami. Aisa tadpasan dunga na…”  All I can say, it’s been a privilege for us minions (well, at least me) to know the coolest and, possibly, the most magnanimous guy in the batch. Here’s hoping you stay un-raped in Delhi and you buy a yacht very soon with all your NVC earnings, so we can sail into the door sunsat and party till 4am… geddit? :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/varad-gunjal">Varad Gunjal</a></p>
<p>Coolest dude undoubtedly! I  him met Vas when we played pre-spree futsal together. This guy is one hell of a futsal player! I've always been jealous of his insane touches and creativity. We played on opposite wings for the BITSFC so it was sad I couldn't link up with him more. Off the pitch he's an amazing friend, funny and charming. He's confident about almost everything he does. Will miss you man. Keep in touch!
