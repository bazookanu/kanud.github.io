<p>suresh...aka vitry..he is my best friend forever...he is the one of the gifts that bits goa has given me...my friendship with him started a bit early as he is neighbor also..and he is also in EEE...& my id n his id no's are also so close..that he is lab partner in many of my EEE labs...where we had the ultimate fun..he is pro volleyball player.he played for college team for 2 years..although he is short his skills over others make him special...he is very good painter also...got many awards in his school life..his school is very special one in its kind ..i didnt forget all those hard truths he shared with me about his school life...n another pass time of his is watching movies that are in DC..as many movies as many times..he sleeps a lot n dreams a lot too.....
he is very innovative in his thoughts...some originality..some freshness..got mixed in his ideas...but he some times got himself into so called mabbu mode...n this is the time i make fun of him..as it is very funny at that times..he is very funny...n cautious..but working with him is a bit tough..as he wont do any help at all until unless if u ask him..but if u ask for help he will do everything in his capacity to satisfy u...and he is a bit shy...that's y he wont talk much......
altogether he is best est friend i ever made in my life...thanks 2 u ...without u may be i miss  some very historic moments in  my life....
ALL THE VERY BEST TO YOUR FUTURE,,,YOU GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD ...
