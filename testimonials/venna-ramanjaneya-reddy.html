<p>I will start this with a word -HARDWORK-- comeon man how can a guy attend almost all the classes and work like anything during xams to get gud marks...this guy is straightforward and sometimes doesnt understand the situation and takes a wrong step...But it doesnt mean that he is a not good guy or something..He is good at heart and helps ppl when they ask for it...i dont know how many marks did he help me out in opti,opre and consys etc...He is a guy who cracks gud ones at times but he will crack some irrelevant and pointless jokes which create another joke from it...Work hard like u are dng now and U will land up somewer up in the sky in shoter span of time....All the best for ur future..I wont leave u anyways.. :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
