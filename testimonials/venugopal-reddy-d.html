<h1 class="page-title">Venugopal Reddy D</h1><p>Venu was my partner in EEEP :D. From that time, till now, I haven't seen him worry over something. Always displays enthusiasm and is really fun to hang around with :), besides being one of the nicest guys at heart. I'll always cherish the fun we had in outings and the fun we made of CBK Murthy :P. You have this contagious habit of spreading smiles, keep it going :D And stay in touch. You rock macha :D:D

<p>Venu!!!!I i  remember we met in 1st year 2nd sem, but i guess it was through lahiri we came to know about one another...When you came to lahiri's room i was bit afraid!!!dont knw why..but yaah..i was.Then through nirmaan meetings we became good friends..  :)We used to watch movies in my rum till late nights with a high volume and disturbing others and i used to oppose you in this context...All those gossips with u and lahiri at the children park and on the benches on the either sides of the road to children park were memorable...The highlight is our Doodhsagar trip!!!!(remember?)You slipped off...and everyone were tensed..by the way there is a pic with a pose..There are many such memorable events which are not coming in my mind!!!!!(may be because of nostalgia)Funny, very fantsizing, helpful and outspoken you are....One thing that i am pretty sure that you will achieve anything you want when you decide..I came to know about this in 2-2..Your dream was to become a bad boy!!! but i do not think that will ever happen :P  :P....All the very best for a great career venu!!!!!And make us proud by achieving what u want to!! keep smiling!!! Good luck!!! :)  :)  :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>venu..he is my neighbor.actually but i dont know that till my second year...he won't be awake in his room ..either sleeping or going out.. his time table is very much similar to a hardcore Bitsian.. may be this is the reason i don't know him well in my first year..but after that he became a good friend of mine..he loves his guitar more than any thing in his room..ha his room.. its a one hell of thing..and if remembered it correctly he lost his key almost 4 or 5 times and then hitting lock with rocks all those seems to be a bit funny..but these are examples of his laziness..:) :) a true NIRMAN member he enjoys helping poor people and love to play with children..very passionate about whatever he is doing..all the best to your future..stay in touch mama..

<p>Sweet lil bro of his elder sister and brother…sweet, kind, outgoing, ambitious, helpful, tooo friendly, innocent(he may not seem so…but he actually is) and STUPID!!! The 1st time I’ve seen him on the campus I felt he is one guy with loads of attitude and too arrogant…but as I got close to him I’ve realized that he is a sweet guy. 
It was in 1-2 when I actually started talking to him, Do u remember the Pune trip during our 1-2…well that was one awesome trip, I can never forget that trip…the snake park, the karla caves, movies and then after coming back, the old goa, calangute trip...do u remember that afternoon in baga waters??!! U, me and suki enjoyed a lot in the beach…tat was an amazing trip…..Since then Venu started going around with us more frequently.
And then there was this Doodsagar trip!!!hahhaaha one epic trip…especially your stunt in the waters..haha…can never forget that scared look on ur face…though I should say that u came back boldly.
It was in 2-1 when I came to know that Venu loves basketball and he plays it well too…he tried hard for the college team, later he started playing Tennis as well.
My 1st Holi on the campus was with Venu and my other friends….haha tat evng before the day of Holi…tat epic pic of SK…hahahaa do u remember that?? (it’ll be on fb in near future)
From 2-2 it was in NIRMAAN that we used to spend more time…he was one great person over there, loved by many juniors…we called him “VenuPriya”
Venu and I were always mocked in NIRMAAN meetings…for our so called “IS” bond.
Apart from the “IS” bond…venu and I also share many interests like vampire diaries, 24, love of same genre of music and love of novels 
U’ll always be my closest buddy on the campus. I adore all those days we used to spend together talking for hours and hours. Nothing can beat the CP-bench talks u, me and deepak used to have. Those were some of the best days of my lyf on the campus. 
And then there are those cherishable days when we used to study together, just before the exams, the whole night  and yeah he has got a really weird taste…of all the subjects IS had, he loved DYSOC (Strange!!)…I hardly used to see him studying any other subject during our 2-2. 
A small line for you : “Though miles may lie between us we are never far apart, for friendship doesn’t count miles its measure by the heart” 
I just hope the best for you and I hope you’ll reach the aspirations of everyone and most importantly yours. Best of Luck. Keep that smile on your face :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/srinivasa-lahiri">Srinivasa Lahiri</a></p>
<p>The first time I met him was during Nirmaan work, during a visit to Zari. Since then, we have spent so many occasions together beginning with Nirmaan work to the informal discussions and treat sessions.He is a fun loving, jovial person, with smile on his face 24*7. He comes up with practical ideas and always takes a valid stance in any situation. A considerate friend, who is there to help you out anytime you are in trouble :). He is fun to be around with, and is almost always the victim of our teasing sessions.. :P. Cannot imagine an Employment operations vertical in Nirmaan without you. I admire the way how you worked without being discouraged even during difficult times and uncertainties :). Wish you All the Best Venu. :D Stay in touch :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chithra">Chithra</a></p>
