<h1 class="page-title">Vibhor Atreya</h1><p>Few people appreciate and honour friendship like he does. A good friend, he is great fun to have around you at all times. He is great at academics and has a passion to learn anything new that he can lay his hands on. Will always help no matter how deep a trouble he might be in himself. Will always remember him as a person to whom I could confide almost everything. Wish him all the best for his future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>One of the most genuine and mostly unbiased person seen on campus.... Friend of friends... he has a simple and straight approach towards life and does things with his full efforts in it... And that's why he succeeds and not feel disheartened... :) Smart and intelligent as he is.. His ability to judge another person with pin point precision is unique ... Though he can be a bit too frank at times... but it's a form in which all he wants is to help the people around him and make good friends... I still remember the fun times we had together when we 1st went out with mohit and the others to Calangute and had loads of fun.... It was an honor to be ur friends and always hope we remain friends and succeed in life... :) LOve,,, Family.... Friends... All mean alot to this person... rest he gives a damn about what people think. :) <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ankit-jain">Ankit Jain</a></p>

<p>I don’t remember when I met him first, I guess it was during bio pre cdc’s. On first impression u feel as if he’s very serious. But that’s not the truth. He’s hardworking, focused and serious about the things he’s passionate about. It’s been 2 years that we have done and will be doing projects together. Our PS I was also the same. He’s very knowledgeable. Working along with him is easy as we understand each other’s working pattern. Principals and morals ka pakka hai. It’s been a pleasure to have him as a friend. He will achieve great heights in future. All the best!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/pradyumn-agarwal">Pradyumn Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Vibhor - One of my very good freind.
Came to know him from our MT-1 labs.And he
made those boring MT labs so funny and entertaining. We still recall those jokes and laugh :)
In all these years I know Vibhor as an extremely dedicated, focused
, organized person and above all a great friend.
I will always remember our early morning chats when all our other friends are sleeping :)
Will always miss him calling me "Parul", only friend here who calls me with this name.

I must say he is an extremely trustworthy friend and very helpful, he is always there for me in all my bad times 
with his caring and support words.

There are so many things I know about him but I really dont know how to frame them in words.
And I know we'll always be in touch so whatever I missed I'll tell you then :P 
Your friendship has been a real pleasure for me.Thanks for everything Vibhor. My best wishes are always with you dear friend !!

Best of luck for your mechanical cdc's and many more big challenges to come in life.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirayu-garg">Chirayu Garg</a></p>
<p>Humour with intelligence built in is what can describe him. He is very hardworking and dedicated. He hears out others peoblm as if they are his own. He has a one-track mind which doenst get distracted by even the fancient things. I wont forget the trips we had. The mumbai adventure, the trains we missed are unforgettable moments. He is fond of documentary movies, so be careful before arguing with him on the technical matters. He is never shy to learn more than what is required which is very a rare quality. With his hardwork and dedication, he is all set to turn his dreams to reality. Thanx vibhor for the wonderful times.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sudeep-gupta">Sudeep Gupta</a></p>

<p>I have never seen a more organized and hardworking person than vibhor. It seems that no beauty in the world can divert the mind of this person. He is very focused about his goals and push really hard to attain those. All these years he was like a icon for me, whenever my mind diverts, i look upon vibhor to inspire from him. I still remember meeting him when we were standing together in sac for our registration. From that day he is more like a brother than a friend to me. Vibhor, May u achieve all the happiness and success...best of luck!!   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aakash-srivastava">AAKASH SRIVASTAVA</a></p>

<p>Vibhor, my bestest friend in the campus with whom i can share anything and everything. A person who vaues friendship  a lot and he is always there for his friends. He is a very idealistic kind of person with great moral values. A very hard-working and a passionate, full of detremination and enthusiasm. He has a very clear vision of what he want to do and be. A good leader and a manager. All our trips were managed by him only, everytime he used to search for a unique, not so popular and a great place to hang out (our trips to japanese garden, bicholim, mayem lake, spice plantation and all other...all of them were 
awesome :) ) which clearly shows how much he loves to explore new stuff. He always use 
to say ' yr jo jagah sabko pta hai aur jaha sab jata hai vaha ja kr kya maza, hum to vaha 
jaayenge jaha koi na gaya ho' ;). Its always fun to hang out with him and he'll always make 
sure that you dont get bored. :) :) 
He is a damn practical, serious and  a humorous person too, the examples he give to relate things, they are just amazing, no other option would fit better than his (can never forget that kung-fu-panda wala comparison :)) ). He is one person who'll make things appear so simple and obvious that one would have never thought it that way. Its his magic touch to thinks and his awesome way of explaining stuff that even a least interested person will lend him his ears. He is very intelligent and a knowledgable person,its not just about acads but he loves to keep all sorts of updates and as aresult its difficult to beat him in any  conversation, as he debates so well.Some people can wipe away your worries and sadness 
in a matter of minute, he is one of those, any problem, just talk to him. He has been a friend 
and a mentor to me. Without him i cant imagine how my bitsg life would had been. Though i know that we are always gonna be there for each other, i wish him a good luck for his future and i know he'll for sure achieve excellence in whatever he do. Veeeebhoorr all the very best for your future. :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavya-goyal">Bhavya Goyal</a></p>
