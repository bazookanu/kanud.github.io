<h1 class="page-title">Vibhor Bajpai</h1><p>There are some people who appeal to you the very moment you meet them. Vibhor is one of those. And the story of how we met is on similar lines.  It was on dc when i first heard him!! :P it was one of his recordings which i had listened to and it was awesome. When he is around, I feel like speaking my mind out. He is really understanding and a great person to talk to. He is fun to be with, to hang out with and I thoroughly relish the times I spend with him. Vibhor literally means happiness. The things which i would really want to learn from him would be patience and adjustment :). He is very clear aboutt his priorities, and manages them very well. He is extremely dedicated, hardworking in whatever work he takes on. He is really very helpful, caring and cheerful human being.. who can actually do anything for his friends!!!! I actually feel myself to be very lucky to have such a person around me.. who is there for me for every single moment. I wish him all the very best in his life.. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/barkha-gupta">BARKHA GUPTA</a></p>
<p>Bhaav Vibhor .. kar deta hai ye ladka aapko apne gaano se aur baaton se. (I had to write this because, when I first met you, this is the term which came to my mind from my old hindi lessons. :P) Well, well, well! Where do I even start it all from.. I first met him, along with all of the other funtooshes, in our very own heavenly corridor on my first night here in this campus. He was my IS buddy, among all the other aliens, I met that night. Initially, I thought that he'd be the one of the usual samples from the herd, who would have come here after slogging their asses etc. you know the usual studious types. But the next day itself my prejudice was shattered to pieces when I saw this maestro strum his (no, Bihadi's) guitar and sing one of the Atif's numbers, in a way you would never expect a engg. student to sing. I was taken aback, as I had greatly underestimated this immensely talented personality and had completely ignored the fact that there can be college students who can actually play and sing 'ghar se nikalte hi..' for real, and this phenomena doesn't always need to be dramatized like I had seen in TV/movies. We thought that we had finally corrected our perception of him and this is what he is, a talented singer who plays guitar/keyboard/flute also. But, there were surprises to come, he was equally fucking talented in doing impromptu mime acts, dance performances and was so incredibly athletic that he could climb the 20 odd feet corridor wall just using his bare feet. This is when we lost all hope in our mental algorithms to correctly judge/predict the amount of talent this maestro had. And as a logical extension to that we never tried to set benchmarks for him, we were fucking humiliated after our first 2 tries. ;) When not doing these heavenly acts, he can be found planning new pranks/chudaap in our very own brainstorming chamber, that is Lakha's room. And when he is not doing this, he can be seen trying his luck at finding someone fooling around with some political/musical topic in a group, it takes a while for him to get a feel of the ongoing discussion, and once he gets it, the orator/debator/eloquent-self or 'god-knows-what' wakes up in him from nowhere and you won't want to get in his way, I bet. The saying goes like, "one does not simply meddle with vibhor on some topic you are not sure of , you are sure to be eater/chewed and thrown into pieces after that." All that said and done, this person has been a really close friend of mine throughout this duration of 3 years(obviously except for that forgettable incident). Doing all the CDC's, assignments, preparing for innumerous exams together, doing a COP together, giving impromptu and unprepared presentations, it was one hell of an incredibly funny ride all the way. I am sure that he will succeed in whatever he chooses to do after passing out from here.(its a different matter that i keep suggesting him to become a playback singer, which he keeps taking lite due to reasons unknown) I wish him all the best for all of his future endeavours! :) :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/alok-upadhyay">Alok Upadhyay</a></p>

<p>Even though we are in the same branch we met through DC (remember Gola Barood Family :D) and from then on we became good friends. With I have had some of the funniest moments in and out of th class. Be it his mimicry of all the proffs. (especially "over" :D) or his singing or his pranks (pen chor(ni) :P) all are just unforgettable. He rarely comes  to class but whenever he does he makes sure to make you laugh either by his googly Questions to proffs or by his pranks :D.  But remember don't involve yourself in an argument with Vibhor because you are bound to lose. Pro coder. I have enjoyed thoroughly in his company.  I am sure he will achieve whatever he aims for. I wish him all the best for his future. Stay in touch  and keep smiling :).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>
<p>My co-IS friend, DataMining friend :D :D…. Vibhor is a very funny guy…especially I love his mimics…it was such an entertainment in the midst of all those horrible teachers :D :D…in my opinion all the IS ppl should have videos of his imitation(especially the “one xample wover” one :P ).
His music talent is amazing…the way he plays the guitar and sings along the tune…aaa…too good.._/\_ _/\_
Vibhor is also good at acads…except that he takes a bit lyt. He is intelligent and asks sensible doubts in classes, good at coding and has the passion to learn more.
Our fun in classes are the most memorable moments…will miss the last bench fun in classes… :(
All the best!!!Have a great lyf ahead :)
