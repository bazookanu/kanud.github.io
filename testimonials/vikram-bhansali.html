<h1 class="page-title">Vikram Bhansali</h1><p>The ideal student one can conjure up in one's mind is reflected in person in Vikram Bhansali. I don't know whether he recalls or not but he was the very first person I spoke to from mechanical engineering after my parents left me on the first day of BITS. A humble, guy who takes to his academics religiously with ferocious passion. A die-hard Shahrukh and HHH fan (I still remember us fighting about HHH and Undertaker in our 1st Yr). A good friend and an understanding person who really goes out of his way in helping whever approached. Having aced all hos core subjects he sure is on his way to be a great Mechanical Engineer. All the best to him for his bright future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>

<p>Aee, Ayee,, aye vikram ! :D My neighbor for the past 3 years. The first impression you'll get by seeing him is of a big time nerd who is just dying to get a book and dive into it. Well, that's true to some extent. Got the Merit scholarship last sem. I rest my case in that matter now. But apart from this he's a completely different person. Has in depth knowledge about cricket, bollywood and WWE. Thinks there has been no cricketer born as elegant as Ganguly, no actor born as studmax (:P) as SRK and no wrestler born as macho as Goldberg. And that's where we all cherish pulling his legs. Say a word against any of the three mentioned above and get ready for a boycott or a counter from him :D He has troubled me a lot by the bullshit music he listens to. Falguni Pathak and some other bollywood bakwaas. But I'd really miss these times when I'd yell at you to stop the crap and you'd rather increase the volume :P He's a very dedicated and focused person. Has helped me through God knows how many courses ! (Thanks to his 100% attendance in all the classes) He shall definitely make his family proud and have a very bright future. All the very best. Apni shaadi me mujhe bula lena please :P (Sirf juice se kaam nahi chalega ;) :D)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>"Vikram, tere notes de sakta hai kya" is one sentence I have used so often  but still he doesn't get irritated. He is a perfect combination of intelligence and hard work and once he sets a goal, he will do whatever he can to achieve it. Deservedly a 8.5+ cg guy, some movies he has suggested have been truly epic ( Read- naughty boy :P). He epitomises the " simple living, high thinking" philosophy and I wish him all the success and happiness in life.   <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gururaj-rao">Gururaj Rao</a></p>
