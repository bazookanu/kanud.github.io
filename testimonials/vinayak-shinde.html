<h1 class="page-title">Vinayak Shinde</h1><p>Vinay.loves.guitar--
His email id says it all! He is the first person I saw playing the guitar in AH3- -He simply stunned me with his "Summer of '69" and "Papa Kehte Hain". A wonderful guitarist, he also has a flair for making home movies (and they look professional). They say he should try Show-biz.His GPS skills need tuning though! :-K---He is a natural speaker-totally impromptu, and he'll always impress the others. Inertia!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>Vinayak Shinde is a fun loving and jolly person. He is a fine guitar player. You should watch his eyes when he plays the guitar. He plays it with real interest! His quotes and comments are well placed and well timed, specially the "Kidney" one in Patnaik sirs class in EGP in 3-1. "What do poor people have to offer? They are poor!" Ans: "Kidney" He knows how to bring laughter on a crying face. He is good at playing pranks too! Like the one he played on Kunal with fake snake or made Rachit's video or Raman Jokes. He is very creative and all my EPS batch-mates would agree on that with me. Perhaps its his ability to bring smiles and create a lighter atmosphere around him that separates him from others and he stands distinctly in the party. I wish him a great and successful future. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sankalp-kulshrestha">Sankalp Kulshrestha</a></p>
<p>Vinayak Shinde is in every sense the Mr Eco of our batch. He carries a special style and charisma with him .He is truly rather the Sultan of strum the pro guitarist. One must be careful with him because he can trick you with his jokes and videos .He is a person who enjoys life to its fullest and a true believer of passion.He is also one of the finest speakers of our campus.Good luck with your future bro .<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raman-ladda">Raman Ladda</a></p>
<p>We should become friends I said....It will be fun he said..and goddamn we were right!!.What a journey it has been! What an awesome person Vinayak is!.
Vinu,Vinya,Nayak,Khalnayak...he is known by many names.He is a brilliant guitar player and a pro at video direction and editing. He is a total prankster and the creator of the famed Raman jokes. I have many fond memories with Vinayak. The way we used to give treats to each other every month, the songs that we "tried" to write, teasing Raman every now and then....it was fun,great fun!! Kudos to Mr.Eco, a fellow Aurangabadi(with the correct pronunciation) and the biggest stud in our group, Vinayak _/\_.
P.S. You owe me one more treat,bro.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tejas-kudrimoti">Tejas Kudrimoti</a></p>
<p>Tailor!!! Another ember of my illustrious nicknames club(other being pagya) . Vinayak personifies the word dude!!! Guitar , looks , hair , books , brains he has it all , the only drawback being that he is from auranga-something village :P. What I spend on food, vinayak spends on his hair. Touch his hair and see the demon in him rise!! He is the sole creator and distributor of the epic 'Raman Jokes ' , in case you have read them , ALL ARE BASED ON TRUE STORIES. He is my mongi,NC ,shahi buddy. Whenever I am half hungry , he is the there to share a dish . His obsession with 'malai' is something he should be sentenced to RI for life. Vinayak has unknowingly(only on my part) led me to eat the worst tasting food ever, 'the malai kofta' and 'the malai tikka' , probably invented as WMD by the germans. He is extremely witty and a great public speaker. To sum up , time spent with him is always filled with jokes and laughter . His rap songs will one day be worldwide bestsellers under the album name 'Dabba' .A warning if you ever happen to be with him in a restaurant- Never let Vinayak order the food  :D . IT has been a privilege to be your friend. All the besshht :)

<p>I still have the "Summer of 69" you sang with me :) .Muliti -talented with a great obsession about his hair.His sense of humour is unique.Has a very infectious smile and a knack to get many many likes on anything he posts on fb.I will always remember the number of times he has tricked Sumant into sharing EXOTIC DISHES saying "are hee best asta" (this is very good"). The Raman-Vinayak jodi is a comic relief  and the healthy camaraderie they share is really awesome.His gps tracking (though it got us in trouble at anjuna) and video editing skills are legendary.Is an extremely slow eater.Though a bit naive he is a very helpful and time pass person to hangout with.He can bring a smile on your face and relieve your stress with his crazy stories.(Btw thanks for that song ;) )A good orator and a gentleman (;D) all the best wishes for future mate :) .

<p>Vinayak is a great guy. Very cheerful, easy-going, well mannered and totally chilled out. He's a excellent speaker - one of the few who really manages to strike a connection with the audience. It has been a treat hearing him during EPS. His natural charisma and pleasant demeanor seem to light up the place wherever he goes. He's very professional and dedicated when it comes to work and this makes him a priceless asset for any team. He has a great sense of humour. Very clever, very witty. He's an excellent guitarist and our song recording sessions are among the best memories that I have at BITS. He's a wonderful friend, you can always count on him. It has been fantastic knowing you. All the best for your future endeavours. :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>
<p>Vinayak Shinde! This guy I believe is the most photogenic person I know. I have never seen a bad photo of his on Facebook. Every photo makes him look like a star! :)
He played the guitar for our MM performance on stage in our first year and it was uh-mazing! His guitaring skills are great and I hope I get to hear him again after that first time!
He is a very fun person to hang out with and his calm nature is infectious! It just drains the tension out of you! It's always fun to hang out with this guy and its been a really nice knowing him here!
Good luck for your future endevours and everything else in life, Vinayak! :) :) :)

<p>I still remember the first day i came to goa. There he was at the vasco station standing with his slim profile, specs and guitar at the back. He reminded me of Shahrukh Khan from Mohabbatein, add to it the serene beauty of Goa campus, I felt like I was living the movie. Came to campus together, got adjacent rooms and what came next was an adventure of a lifetime. Be it the Saturday night Bhel, making short videos having milk cartons, disappearing mouse or talking in hyderabadi accent, doing “group study” even though we were studying entirely different subjects(:P) or even making songs on ladda, every day was full of life. I was the one who had to suffer by listening to songs playing in an endless loop like “you belong with me, lazarus, zombie”. But then, I was also the lucky one who got to hear all the lovely tunes on his guitar for the past three years. I witnessed him transition from just another guy from Aurangabad to stud, to isshtudd and finally to isshtuddmaxxx that he is today. I can keep going on and on but I am confined by the size of this box. All I want to say is that I could not have had a better neighbor and friend, and if given the opportunity to live the hostel life again it would be nowhere else but right in your neighborhood… :’) All the best for your future bro…<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shakti-thakran">Shakti Thakran</a></p>

<p>As cool as Vinu’. This phrase took time to catch up because vinayak didn’t finish that cucumber fast. Ok jokes aside Vinayak really is a cool, confident and chic person. He has multiple career options. Be it as a guitarist, hair-stylist, journalist or gym-instructor (maybe).  But I’m glad he didn’t choose that and came here or we wouldn’t have met.A real charmer,I first met him when i heard some people were listening to Summer of 69 and it turned out that he was playing it!! And since then it always been smooth sailing with him..He was my gym buddy(whatever short the period maybe). Always there to listen to your problems and talk on anything he has been a good friend for 3 years.I know one day I'll see your band performing somewhere and don't worry 'kam ho jayega'. All the best for your future endeavors!
