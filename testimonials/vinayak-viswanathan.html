<p>A fellow Mumbaikar,he is the undisputed nerd of the Chemical Branch.One whose concepts are one of the clearest in this branch on campus,he has always excelled in areas he is passionate about.Loves football and bleeds for Liverpool.He can sometimes get hot-headed but that shows how passionate he is about stuff.He is very ambitious and hard-working and he will surely achieve all his goals.He is also one of the most self-demanding people I have met who constantly pushes himself and is unsatisfied with anything less than 110%. I wish him all the best for his future goals(read MS :P). <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/praveen-shreenivas-addagatla">Praveen Shreenivas Addagatla</a></p>
<p>A courageous, reliable person and fun to hang out with at the same time. I got to know him better when we shared the same acco. during our stay in chennai 4 Ps-1. We had so many funny ppl to make our life interesting. A hardworker and thinks more than just bookish knowledge unlike most Bitsians. Gud luck 4 ur future plans:).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thomas-abu-c">THOMAS ABU C</a></p>
