<h1 class="page-title">Vipul Pandey</h1><p>Calm, a good observer, hard-working, passionate, these are few of the many good qualities you can observe as soon as you meet this, a very good friend of mine, Vipul. As a DOJMA Head for Quark, he has set absolutely and without any doubt, a perfect example of how to do work without exaggerating things. I got to know him in my 2nd semester, through one of my friends, and through chit-chat on DC. Indeed a very good writer, and I would not be surprised if in future, I see his name in the columns of "The Hindu", "TOI", "HT", etc. Definitely a man of his words, he is by far one of the best coordinators, I have seen till now. Though I would love to know more of him but I am sure he will achieve greater heights in years to come. All the very best! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-goyal">Arpit Goyal</a></p>
<p>Algorithm, as i know him from DC .... one of the pro mainchatters of 2k9 batch :D
A successful Quark Coordinator for Dojma. Very good writing skills - especially impressed with the testimonial he wrote for me :D 
Calm natured, down to earth person. Qualities which is rarely seen in a confident yet entertaining dc mainchatter. Very hardworking person. I loved your articles on Quark! (more than my own fest articles actually $-/)
Wish you a very best luck for future :)

<p>Pandey!!
Pandey is one of a kind. Very different from normal humans. A sincere and a really hard working guy. It's been a really good experience working with him for 3 years for DoJMA. This guy just never stops before he completes a work alloted to him doesnt matter how he does that but he just gets it done(several tantrums follow but anyway) Serious stuff apart, it's been a fun journey with him in DoJMA. he is the super dedicated and most sincere member of DoJMA(along with his very dear joshi).From Ice n Spice random treats to mongi brain storming sessions, we have shared some really good memories. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/anmol-srivastava">Anmol Srivastava</a></p>

<p>Vipul Pandey will probably go down in history as the first man ever to spam multiple reminders to DoJMA juniors nagging them to send in their work before the deadlines. That says a lot about this guy's ability and motivation to simply get things done, a trait which has served him well as the rather excellent Quark Coordinator of DoJMA in 2011-12. Throughout the 3 years that we have been in the department together, he has never failed to amaze me by the sheer amount of dedication, focus, passion he brings to the work at hand. His rather other-wordly sense of humour has been a source of constant laughter, given his insightful comments and witty, downright hilarious takes on much of what happens around the globe. Will cherish all those rib-tickling discussions and post-interview post-mortems that we held while writing our articles (and there were loads of those!!). Rock-solid friend, one whom you can always absolutely depend on and trust without a damn care. I will always remember all the crazy times we went through together; the hilarious write-ups, the hectic interviews, endless debates on issue content and design...it was a superb learning experience for me and the rest of us in the department. Enjoyed working for BITSCAN together, and will especially look back and laugh at our epic BITSCAN photo shoot for which we actually practised posing. The only person on my gtalk list who stays online almost as much as I do, he has always been a bountiful source of entertaining chats about anything and everything in general and campus politics in particular. Notwithstanding his peculiar obsessions with cows, his favourite pair of shoes and chambal-ka-daaku type facial hair, he has and will always be a trustworthy and sensible counsel. I shall forever remember his advice to watch films like Gunda which I still consider to be the finest piece of cinematic art ever. Keep up the suggestions Pandeyji!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/abhijit-joshi">Abhijit Joshi</a></p>
<p>Pandey ji :) Inke baare hum kya kahein, shabd kam padh jaenge :P He is a really wonderful person and an awesome guy. One of few people I actually enjoyed working with in the Quark coco, he has a unique charm that makes him special. Pretty straight-forward and polite, his humility is something I always admire. May he have a rocking future (CS :P) and keep smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Pandu. Pandeyji. My darling :D He's a typical journalist material. A very keen observer and would speak only when necessary. A very intelligent and reasonable person to work with. We did a COP together under the big time bad ass of BITS goa (the-one-who-should-not-be-named). We faced many hurdles but I liked the ways he suggested to overcome them. He did a truly awesome job as the coordinator for Dojma (yeah right :P) for Quark 2012. My opinion of Pandu is a guy who is a tremendous workaholic and doesn't a f**k about the rest. Never  shaves. His obsession for DC is something we don't need to talk about. Pandeyji is the hub of campus news varying from placements to sem-back. We mock him a lot (ayee panduuuu :D) but he never takes it to his heart. This is the best part about him that I like. Have a wonderful life ahead pandu. Thode maze bih kar lena bhai :D Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/chirag-agarwal">Chirag Agarwal</a></p>
<p>Pandeyji, with his glinting eyes behind the glassy glasses, unshaven facial hair and the trademark cocky smile, might come across as your neighborhood serial killer/ rapist (All you need is a grey trench coat, a hat, goggles and a van with dark windows). However, looks can be deceiving- for pandeyji is nothing more than a benign and, actually, rather sensible a creature, though overtly obsessed about cows (no clue what that one's about).
I first met him through Dojma. Right from the start, his enthusiasm and sincerity was very evident (yes, him and joshiji were the only ones to turn up on time for the dept. meetings more often than not :D).  Worked furiously, and also expected (and extracted?) the same from others. Seriously, /\ for whatever you did for the spree treasure hunt. Naturally, went on to hold the tremendously popular post of the quark coordinator for Dojma. Now that I think about it, it's difficult to imagine where dojma would have been without pandeyji and his nagging, mailing, calling, writing and editing. It's been an amazing journey, the past three years- never thought that i'd have so much to take away from Dojma in the form of fond memories, sweet and sweeter.
Besides that, he's a guy with a weirdly twisted sense of humor- can deflate the most sensible/ intelligent remarks with nothing more than his trademark wry sarcastic gaze. ( I cannot do that, however much i try :P). Can share a laugh with him at almost anytime, whatever be the situation. Is concerned, but not overtly worried about the things that... well... concern him. (another one of his characteristics i try to emulate!) Yet, at the same time, is passionate, dedicated and willing to put in as much effort as it takes for things that interest him. Is ridiculously dependable (thanks for covering my a** in the difficult times of Spree) and will just get the work done, even though you just might get the work done yourself in the time it sometimes takes to convince him to do it.
All in all, a quirky yet lovable character and a dear friend- may  the "mucus gum" bonds of friendship stay strong!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-palnitkar">Aditya Palnitkar</a></p>
<p>The most down-to-earth and calm person I know on campus. :) With the friendly and jolly nature, streaming down his blood and a smile on his face, you set an inspiration for those who are frustrated and tired from handling life at BITS. I loved working under you. And haan, thodi tension kam liya karna. And, naya phone bhi khareed lena. :P :) Take Care. May you have a super-rocking life ahead. :) Stay in touch. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/bhavul-gauri">Bhavul Gauri</a></p>
<p>It was awesome working under/with you dude, not to mention all the gossip cum prank sessions we had. Hope Satya doesn’t read this :P. You’ve got amazing persuasive powers (it was after your chat after the interview, that I had changed my mind :P ). Oh and of course how could I forget, suits suit you :P ;)

<p>I'll always remember how all of us spent Music Nite during Quark- the IC dinner, the DoJMA gossip ( :P), brainstorming on the future of the Department. I always loved when he's update his Gtalk status to 'Bacche bade ho gaye'. He sure knew how to give us a boost when we needed it! Vipul is one of the most grounded people I know, someone who has always taken his work seriously and the only one who came to the Children's Park with the Festival Issue to be passed on (Thanks, man!). He will be pleased to know I too have now started spamming the Herald magnet on DC.
 Wishing you all the best for the future. Stay in touch :)
