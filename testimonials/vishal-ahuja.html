<h1 class="page-title">vishal ahuja</h1><p>Vishal, mere bachpan ka yaar (for those who don’t know, LKG se yahan tak mere saath, bitsat exam aaju-baaju mein baithke diya, bitsat score aas-paas tha, same branch li, even room bhi aamne-saamne mila :) )…hamesha hi ekdum cheerful rehta hai, hamesha hi logon ko hasaata rehta hai, khush rakta hai, apne aas-paas ke maahawl ko khushgawaar rakhta hai, har koi iski company enjoy karta hai…iski company mein rehna chahta hai, bohut hi kam logon mein ye baat hoti hai…..yaaron ka yaar hai, yaari to koi isse seekhe (and I mean it ), ekdum mastmaula jise kehte hain aisa hai mera yaar. Har party, har DJ nite ki jaan hai. Mehenti hai bohut, jo bhi karta hai passionately karta hai. He’s very ambitious. Whatever he takes up does it to his best with extreme devotion and hardwork. He owns a gr8 quality of working consistently with same zeal everytime. Very few ppl know or even none dat he is very good at writing poetry. Mere yaar hamesha khush raho aur bulandiyon ko haasil karo yahi meri kaamna hai. Humhara yahan tak ka saath is a mere coincidence and hopefully aage bhi rahega, no doubt about it, but what I feel is: A friend is never a coincidence in your life, They are meant to enter your life to bring you joy & laughter. So, I will treasure the friendship between us all my life :).........<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-jain">Rahul Jain</a></p>

<p>Ahujje !! I met him on my second day of campus asking him for what was done in class as I had missed my first day. He is a cool guy who doesn't care for things much(jo ho raha hai hone do) An apne me mast, bindass banda. Probably has never been tensed. He is a guy who is rarely dull and you will always love is company. An enthusiastic DJ dancer and we have shared some great moments on the dance floor. Zephyr 2k11 was probably the best. I wish him all the best for his future and a great life ahead. Cheers !<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rajat-koujalagi">Rajat Koujalagi</a></p>
<p>Vishal, he was one of the first chemistry guy i met in campus. In short, he is a person who knows how to get things done, he is very charming and i can't forget all the labs we had together from workshop to CE. He is a  fun person to be with always cracking jokes and making the mood light in most hectic of the conditions.Apart from this he is very good in whatever he do, and how he prioritize some things over others is the most remarkable quality he has for which i admire him the most. I wish all the best for his bright future ahead of him and hoping we will remain in touch. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/tarun-khanna">Tarun Khanna</a></p>

<p>Yo Ahujje.. !!!!
A guy with immense creativity and passion for whatever he loves. He is a person who will make you smile whenever u r sad, no matter what he has to do. Doston ka dost… I have enjoyed fighting with him over trivial matters … He is also one the most frank persons I know. Also he holds his values high and I am sure no matter what he wont compromise with his values… I wish him all the best and may he achieve whatever he wishes for… !!
