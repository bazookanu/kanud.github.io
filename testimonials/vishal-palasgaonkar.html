<h1 class="page-title">Vishal Palasgaonkar</h1><p>Vishal has been one of the few guys whom I considered to be lite like me..Sadly he didnt put so much effort into getting a low CG like mine..Good for you man..I guess he has all the qualities one can expect from a good friend.. honest, real, helpful. No matter whether its an exam , big game or any fucking occasion he is always there with a smile in his face. I hope you succeed wherever you go man and it has been a pleasure being your friend. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/manasjyoti-saloi">Manasjyoti Saloi</a></p>
<p>Vishal "GG" Palasgaokar - a true gamer.
This guy is very practical, rational, and yet a big fan of the fantasy genre. He is a voracious reader, big TV Series addict,  a fellow anime fan, and a fellow 9gag addict. I believe he has read more books, watched more TV shows and spent more hours gaming than most of me and my friends' put combined. A god-level gamer when it comes to AOE (hence the middle name GG). I have known him since first sem, but we did not really interacted much till 2-2 during the pre-CDCs, and then the dreaded CDCs came. We have had a great time (<b>  !</b>studying) CDCs together :P. I have always loved those discussions and the topics have been very diverse. I admire the opinions you have to give, although that stubbornness of yours does nag me little. 
<p>
Here's a toast to those countless(?) hours spent making sense of TOC/PLCC/consys, and then regretting(?) not attending classes; to those lengthy discussions varying from quantum to anime to theology to latest shows to Greek mythology to what not; to all the under-arm matches; and last but not the least to times when the first meal of day(night?) has been at nc :D. I will definitely miss the discussions, best wishes for your future :).
<p>
P.S : koi naya anime/tv series bata. fafafafa !!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/parth-pooniwala">Parth Pooniwala</a></p>
<p>Vishy is one of my first friends in BITS, i had met him during the tym of registration only
from our 1st convos, i thot him 2 b a very studious and geeky guy.....but 3 yrs down the line he has proved  me wrong..... 
Vishy is fine all-rounder literally.....the no of movies and tv series he's watched and the books that he has read is immense and that actually makes him eligible to be a 
strong critic that he is :P
he's an awesome gamer as well( be it AOE,FIFA,CS any damn game)  and his skills r not limited indoors, he is equally good in table tennis and cricket ( he has succesfully
taught me cutters and under arm leggies :D)
although many times i dont agree with all his views but still i  like to have an interesting debate with him on movies and  esp cricket 
he is somebody who does full justice to 'sleeping':P 
....i remember he slept through half of es-1 t1 and still scored av + :x
inspite of so much activities, i dont know how he does
manage to find time for studies
in the past few months, Vishy has become a nocturnal creature,
so its actually a great surprise if u get to even see him  these days....
all the best for your future and hoping to meet you in NC
in the next 2-3 days :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/akshay-verenkar">Akshay Verenkar</a></p>
<p>vishy the viper.. Psssttt..... :P ... Well i also call him "naam bade and darshan chhote" at times but thats just for fun. I know he wants to kill me when i bug him like that but then being the "VISHAL" one out of the two has its own advantages, :P ;) ... Well, seriously, he is a very smart, down to earth, calm and composed person. Hardly bothered by anything and prefers to stay in his own world where he can sleep whenever he wants to :P, watch anime and any other tv series thats there on DC and just live life the way he wants. One cannot do without mentioning his cricket skills and his love for that sports. Had an awesome time playing fifa with him too. All the best to you mate. Wish you get all what you want and more :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
