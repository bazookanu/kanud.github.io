<p>Discipline.. the word that best describes Vishal. Its been 3 years since i know him and is by far the only person who has been minutely affected by hostel life, be it his schedule, his language or anything... The first IS friend on campus and one of my best too... has been my partner in almost all of the assignments and projects till date and I can assure you that he takes work seriously!! Even if the group decides to take li8.. he does everything single handedly (good for us :P)... can get very angry (and everyone is afraid of him ;) ... I remember the first time some of us tried to install CS on his laptop and what happened!!!! :P though he played a lot after some time... the best part was our FIFA matches in 2-1 and 2-2.. we used to play like everyday after classes and those IS vs ENI matches were amazing.... will surely miss that for a long long time.... the codes we used to write in OOPS, COA and OS were also fun... felt very bad when you withdrew from Android :( .... nevertheless its been great to have a friend like you and will surely remain in touch for a long time.. hope that our PS is at the same place... wish you loads of luck and i am sure you have a very bright and prosperous future ahead!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rahul-anand">Rahul Anand</a></p>

<p>Vishal S ! I always ask people "How the heck does he do it?" Sleeping off at 9, waking up at 5, bathing at 7, breakfast at 7:30 even on a Sunday ! But, I guess, he has this determination innate. Just don't leave this discipline in you, no matter what, ever ! :) I've had my fair share of VishalS' trademark <font color="red">anger</font>. Be it teasing him for a girl or constantly pissing him off like in OR class. Sometimes, I even had to send messages to people stating "If I die or suspiciously disappear within the next few days, please hold Vishal S responsible." PS: Hope one day, you'll tell me and <a href="http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/478" target="_blank">Pranav</a> who she is ! :) Whenever he picks up a task, there is always this disturbance within him, until he gets it right. Be it the Rubik's Cube or Coding for his project! A phodu at acads, he's simple, he's quiet, he's a silent assassin you can say! Always helpful and very hard-working. Pika said it right, India does need people like you :) Keep in Touch! Best,<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yash-patodia">Yash Patodia</a></p>
<p>The name is Sinha, Vishal Sinha :D

He's the angry young man of our group.... mess with him and see what he does to you...
I still remember the day when i failed to return something to him..he knocks at my door and 
 " rastogi compass lautade nahi to mere pass doosre tareeke bhi hai ", man , i was shit scared ! ... and also the famous pato's incident  ( bol ..bol...boooooolllll saaallle and then , pin drop silence ) .
There's a lot we can learn from him. He's the most puctual and sincere person i've seen in bits. Very disciplined ..sleeps early ..wakes up early. In fact, there have been times when he woke up before i went to sleep .. if you want to wake up early, his is the right door to knock..
Very intelligent , pro in technical stuff. He has this strange hobby of collecting boarding passes :P . Always has a big smile on his face no matter what :) . We've had many trips together, mostly bday parties :P , and others not to forget the morjim trip..
Thanks for all those biscuits which i never returned :P .
 I know you'll make it big in future. It was a pleasure to have known you and have a friend like you...  all the very best ... stay in touch. 
PS.. Mumbai sucks big deal :D

<p>"Aur Vishal..! Kya kar raha hai?" This is what I say most of the time I go into your room. Don't I? You're among the fastest speaking persons I've met! Our road-trips, well only 2 of them, :P, I remember you saying after that trip to Chapora, "Ab mai kabhi nahi jaane wala scooty se!" :D It was great to meet a person like you who is, most probably, the only one who still believes in "Early to bed, early to rise". Don't leave this habit of yours! Ever! You'll be an example for my kids (:P) Academics ka kya bolun, too good in mathematics, IS pro!, Ubuntu GOD. I will never forget those UNO days in your room and then at the balcony; those moments in your room, discussing news, tech. etc.; your habit of sharing ANY link you find related to Kolkata :P <br>
One genuine advice: try losing that moustache of yours someday ;) <br>
All the best. Keep in touch. Kolkata aana tujhe ghumaunga :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yachit-mahajan">Yachit Mahajan</a></p>
<p>Bisaaaaaaalllllllll (as many call him )/ bisaaalS1991  as i call him is a silent , ideal(est) ,sincere,  dead serious boy amongst our group. No1 messes with bisaaal else isse doosre tarike bhi pataa hai. He will come to room keep his hand on ur shoulder and u know wat comes next , “ Aur “%ur_name” with “h” silent). Although he doesn’t like to speak about………,he has the news of everything. “Aur subham, aaj maine isse-usse/tujhe dekha…… ROFL( I m literally rofling while writing this) !!!!” . Apart from that he has a thing for checking/ going thru every folder of ftp . “Shubham tere ABC ke marx aa gaye, dekha tune??”. 1st person to fill the mess option ( punctuality dude) ,sleeps @ 9 in night and wakes up @ god knows at wat time ( early obb).Not at all a big fan of mess food, eats dinner 3 out of 7 days. The way he kiks out ppl from his room during his time to sleep “ chal chal, abb mere ko sona hai!!!”.One of the guy who gives me competition in eating speed .always there to help ,” bisaaal yeh padhaa do plzzzzz,  ” ,always  has something to eat in his room. 
Acads mein toh kya bolu, ek dum phodu!!! Go to his room hamesha kuch naa kuch codes on laptop / assignment, books lying on bed , teahing 2-3 ppl something.(this is during 3rd year) .During 2nd year as u all know IS li8est , full-day fifa 11 !!! :D :D:D .
Nice to have such a good friend and wish u very best and bright future ahead, jahan jaoge machaa dena bas!!! Keep in touch !!

<p>Known him since 6th standard, he was a genius then, and even now he is no less than Einstein. The ideal student any professor would love to have, he is genuine hard working fellow. I dont see any change in him since the 6th standard when we met (Ofcourse he has grown tall). He has an extensive knowledge and always keeps himself updated. A genuine, honest and down-to-earth guy, he has a huge group of friends. Another aspect of his character is his punctuality. Sleep at 9 , get up at 5. Doing that in college is difficult. Dunno how he managed it. But then he is Vishal. Anything is possible for him. I hope he reaches greater heights. I wish him Good Luck for his journey. Wish that our roads cross again in future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/koustubh-laha">Koustubh Laha</a></p>
<p>Vishal babu,....the most sincere and disciplined guy I have ever met, very humble and down to earth.....He is hard working and very nice person... The best thing is that he always keeps a smile at his face....A very nice person to talk to who never boasts of anything... He is so good at Ubuntu that we usually call him by by that only..."Ubuntu man"... A very jovial person who remains quiet and simple but leaves a deep impression. Every time he goes somewhere he never forgets to peek in my room just for a second to say Hi.........He never talks foul ... He also has the cleanest room in our hostel............Hope you get great success in life.....All the best for your future .. It is a pleasure having you as my friend...:)...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aman-preet-singh">Aman Preet Singh</a></p>
<p>Sincerity personified..!!! absolutely...!! This guy is so sincere that he will go even for a canceled class :P just to see if it wasn't a rumor.. :P.. So much of sincerity plus a lot of efforts and intense hardworking capability is what makes him stand out from the rest... A totally dedicated person to whatever he does..!! Once taken a task.. NEVER-SAYS-DIE. (Gets a bit tensed up and fidgety during the deadlines.. .:P).. completes it under any circumstances...  A guy who takes things very seriously ... I have never ever seen the charming smile of his disappear ... Always greets you with a smile.. Every where he goes he creates an atmosphere of joy and happiness...  A guy you really really can rely on for any sort of help..  Probably the only person who rarely has been to the Night canteen... (Thanx to the habit of sleeping at 9 :P).. A nice person to be with ... An expert JAVA programmer.. (Had an awesome time working with you during the project... ) Always has an urge of learning new things... A wannabe Developer :P... Thanx to the SE course for putting some more light in your career... :) :P... A totally diligent person full of enthusiasm to do things.. Keep it up.. Nice job... All the very best for your future...

<p><center>There and back again by Bilbo Baggins</center> <br>  <center> On hobbits</center> <br> Too late to write any testimonial for you that mentions all your characteristic attributes. So lets not waste space ;-). I still cant remember when we first met. I am sure Rahul would be happy to claim the responsibility. As we say, you were always there, like this universe. You were always there. 6 semesters and I cant remember a day when i didn't come to your room and tell all sorts of stories and the usual chudaap. You were always there to listen, to laugh along and to help me. In a way you taught me how important is to remain silent and listen. I cant think of anyone else but you to give me company at our favorite spot (our beloved balcony) in the evenings. How can I forgot those million-dollar childlike-vishal-sheer-innocence moments, those moments when you used to peek into our rooms with the signature "Hmmmmm", those 2 AM smses to wake me up(btw.. you will be getting them even when you are away :p), those angry-young-man moments when some one used to say "Vishal abhi tak soya nazi" or when someone used to screw around(usually me or sriram) during tests. Things like complaining about other people, how pointless and unfair the world is and shit are just alien to you. I will remember all those idle times we spent in your room behind closed doors :p and how you used to keep track of time to the nano seconds so that we might not run into a crowded Shopco. I will miss those "always welcome" to the  "you don't mess with the zohan" look. Where shall rahul and me go after getting tired/bored/fed up??. I guess I have to remind myself that our ways are going to part soon. I do know that once you leave, the place will be much more empty, but I also do know how good you are going to be at what you do. But nevertheless, I will just miss you my friend and I love you. PS: I dont know HTML, as you know ofcourse(speaking of which, does anyone know me better than you?), might have messed up. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Vishal, the best workshop partner one can ever have. Calm, innocent and a man of few words. At that time I used to wonder how can person speak so less but then I think he believes in action speaks louder than words. A pro-coder or should I say "the star coder" in Verilog. Every ready to help you. And also very disciplined and punctual (even for mess :P)  Thank you Vishal for all those Verilog codes and for being such a wonderful workshop partner.  With all that you have got, you are surely gonna achieve whatever you wish for. All the best for a very bright future. Keep Smiling :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/noopur-jain">Noopur Jain</a></p>
<p>What a person man? Truly a gem and a very rare organism.Couldn't have been better to have someone else has my neighbour. His approach towards life is amazing and he is very disciplined. The best thing is he does whatever he decides. There is never a thing which he regrets or a point when he is dissatisfied. His casual strolsl in our corridor gives a sense of reassurance that there is someone who is taking care about me and will make sure that i am awake and studying. Is bande ke paas kuch bhi mil jaata hai - stationary, toothpaste, or if you are hungry, you are sure to find back up in his room. Vishal bhai be in touch for sure and wishing you a great life ahead!!!!!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-dadu">Aditya Dadu</a></p>
