<p>Well what do I say about the "God of Everything"!!! His multi-dimensional talent has left everyone awe-struck(atleast me)... A great artist, guitarist, mathematician and much more. Really humble and genuine at heart. Even if he's annoyed at you, he's gonna help you in whatever way possible. I was REALLY FORTUNATE to have to my neighbour! I thank God for this! God bless you buddy..!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/prashant-mishra">Prashant Mishra</a></p>
<p>Talentwise-Vishal...knowledgewise-Vishal.
"He is the topper.He has 75 marks" This is the sentence that many of us still remember--the topper of our BITS' first paper! Vishal has been a good friend all these years, and his passion for CFD and art is overwhelming. One look at his 'Mother and son' painting will moisten the eyes of the most stone-hearted person. "Sontakke is a portmanteau of Sontagg and Borgnakke", I said to him, and he seemed mighty pleased!! The name that he gave to Mr. V Sunil ***** has a permanent spot in my head :D We are now breakfast buddies, with gappa from Korpiklaani to Mumbai stories. Vishal, we thank you for making Mr. V Sunil ##### immortal for us!! All the best!! We know that you are going to induce a whirlpool in the field of Fluid Dynamics! <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>The first time I talked to Vishal was just before collecting our thermodynamics papers.Within minutes I got to know that I had just been talking to the thermo God _/\_.The topper of the very first exam in our BITS life.He is pro at everything he does.Be it acads ,sketching ,photography, gaming or playing guitar.I still remember how he used to dominate in "split second" :P.He usually doesn't come for outings and trips but is regular when it comes to going to the night canteen :D .I Know one thing for sure,next sem mech CDCs phodega :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-gupta">Arpit Gupta</a></p>

<p>Sontakke, i remember you from 1st sem thermodynamics when you topped t1 :P Initially i thought you would be a nerd and studious kind of a fellow but i was so wrong. You are one hell of a talent and we all have seen you art work and guitar skills. A very cool, calm and cheerful person, always ready to laugh with others. Helpful when someone needs it and a total jolly fella. It was great knowing you mate and i have no doubt what so ever that you will do great in your life ahead. All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/rachit-kulshreshtha">Rachit Kulshreshtha</a></p>
