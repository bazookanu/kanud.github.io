<h1 class="page-title">Vishnu Prasad</h1><p>I first met him when he pulled a rather funny gag on me on the first year thorough DC by calling me to his room whilst giving the hostel assistant's room number. However do not be fooled by this id pic guys. Beneath that greying cranium lies one of the brightest minds I have come across in college. A complete genius, he is perhaps the best mechanical engineer that will graduate from our batch in true technical terms. I know incidents when Phd. professors are unable to address the doubts he sometimes raises in class.  This guy attended ME lectures(Babu Sir's)  while in 3rd year, A great guy who has always helped me. Happened to learn a lot from him and hope that we remain friends forever. I wish him all the very best for his future which I know is definitely very bright.

<p>This machan who has been a mystery throughout the 3 years have know him. He is quiet, he is deadly and he will remain a mystery. All i know is when i am drunk this guy keeps listening to my foolish rants on crappy-good philosophies. Ohhh this man has yanked my chain throughout the years. His criticism is spot on. You spend time with him and you will discover new and new things about him. The man who has given me critical help when I need it. A slap on the back and on the face when i needed it (Ouch). The white flabby POLAR BEAR : Vishnu Prasad. May all the good things come to you drunk and unhindered (i have no clue what that means).<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/edwin-abraham">Edwin Abraham</a></p>
<p>Vishnu Prasad aka polar bear :P , is a very serious guy and hardly talks . He is very quiet and always keeps things to himself no matter what it is .But dont let these qualities fool you into thinking that he is a very decent guy :P . Irritating others and doing random shit on DC is one of his main hobbies :D . When it comes to acads , he is a proper nerd and does extremely well esp in his mech subjects . All the best for your future my dear friend ..... farewell :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vivek-g-kamath">Vivek G Kamath</a></p>
<p>I would just call him Mr.LIb rather than vishnu...oh come on man how can a man spend 8-10(or even more) for days continuously in library just after the exams....I would say that I love his passion for mechanical and he works on his interests and at the same time rocks his acads...I would always pick him out as most dedicated mechanical engineering student in our batch(In my opinion)...He even attended some extra elective which he didn't register but still he had interest and he took permission from Babu and attended it....I haven't seen such a dedicated guy like him in our batch..He is cool,fun-loving and cracks some laughable jokes...We had awesome discussions in our tp-2 lab and we had nothing else to do in the lab and all we did was to discuss something on courses or faculty or something on education system..(What else can we expect from this kinda guy).. He has been good friend of me for an year and we always use to have a good time..Hope that it continues and all the best for your future.....<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gurujala-jaydeep">GURUJALA JAYDEEP</a></p>
<p>Vishnu ,what can I say about you?He has been one of my closest friends since my first year.I actually met him on the day I  reached campus. Since then it has been a journey.He has helped me a lot in acads, especially in third year. Beleive me, sitting beside this guy in library while he solves problems at mind- bugging speeds can be very inspiring.He has also done a lot in developing my interests in mechanical engineering initially which I had thought was very boring. This grey-haired genius is a genius and is going to go a long way  in his career. He is , I think, the only student from our batch to have published a paper during PS-1. Besides acads, he also knows how to live life, when to take li8.  He is good with the ladies, and has made  quite an impression on many of them :).  All the best for your future, my friend!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nithin-s-poduval">Nithin S Poduval</a></p>
