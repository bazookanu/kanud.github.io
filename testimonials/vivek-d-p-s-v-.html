<h1 class="page-title">Vivek D P S V </h1><p>"Flumech Pro" well that nick never really caught on, but I have always valued Vivek as a one. He has been there to inform me about assignments and has helped me with my acads when I was at an all time low. Also we have spent almost all our labs together manipulating values, so that is something I'm gonna miss. Having successfully managed to do well both academically as well organizing FOOTBALL,one of the biggest events in SPREE '12, he can do it all. He is a straight-forward person who is very focused and I'm sure a bright future is awaiting him :) Enjoy <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arvind-ranganathan">Arvind Ranganathan</a></p>
<p>Dextrous, intelligent and a restless knack to learn define him. He is forever ready with advice that is nearly always helpful. Learnt quite a lot from him. His command over Fluid Dynamics still awes me and I wish him all the very best for his future which I am sure is positively bright,<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/raghav-bansal">Raghav Bansal</a></p>
<p>Vivek is one of those guy who instantly strikes you as being sincere. He is a hard working, conceptually strong, CFD champ! Vivek is a really modest and selfless person- he always desires the best for others, and will readily help them achieve it. He is an all-out football, and was the incharge of football in Spree '12. I value him as a Mechanical Engineer and a friend! All The Best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aditya-modak">Aditya Modak</a></p>
<p>The teachers pet. I remember running to his room before every exam to ask  for the portions.
Also hes a football fanatic. Whenever i go to his room i always find him browsing through goal.com even if its just minutes before the exam.He was in charge of spree football n futsal this year and made both these events a great success.(and BTW i still have those air pumps u left in my room during spree :D )
Hes really modest and helpful and has been a great friend these past years. Hope u get only the best in ur future.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/aswin-gigi">Aswin Gigi</a></p>
