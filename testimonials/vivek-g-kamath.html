<h1 class="page-title">Vivek G Kamath</h1><p>He is a very gud friend. He has been very supportive to me over the past 3 years.  An awsome person to hang out with, he is also a great CS gamer. Very focused on his career, he is bound to succeed in whatever path he aspires to go through. Was great knowing you and hope you'll keep in touch!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/nithin-s-poduval">Nithin S Poduval</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the most determined, ambitious ( and perverted :P ) mallu that I know. Very sociable, he has a way of turning even the most boring and mundane of situations into the best of times. Lots of pseudo-seriousness with a bit of sarcasm here and there makes him the perfect company for all the partying and the odd weekend eat-outs. And yeah, one a more important note: Take li8 man..things always have a way of turning out for the better. Its just a matter of waiting it out :D. Good luck for your future .

<p>Vivek!! ...I still remember the day he used to talk only in english, and today is the day he speaks hindi so fluently!!! A very good human being, always ready to help. Cares so much about his future, I'll always remember our career plan discussions!!! He is an ideal neighbour, I couldn't have asked for more. I won't forget going to gym together, no matter how harsh the climate was, or at what time we slept at night (/\ determination at that time).  Its always fun gossiping with him, makes u feel at ease. We have so many things to cherish, all of them can't b described here. I'll miss waking up each other in the morning during tests. And the subjects which we got screwed together( dere are lots of them!!!). Tu jahan bhi jayega, fodega. Coz you are damn hard-working. I wish you all the very best for your future!!! (We'll meet wen all our drmz hv come true, it'll b fun) !! Farewell!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vibhor-atreya">Vibhor Atreya</a></p>

<p>Vivek or Kamat as he is more often called is one of the most serious and hardworking guys on campus. Though a bit reserved, this guy is really sociable and has loads of friends. He tends to worry a lot about his cg, studies and future(a lot) but, he is fun to hang out with. A pro CS player(:P) as well as a COD enthusiast this guy  has all the latest info on current campus news. Wish you all the best in your future and keep in touch.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/ben-thomas">Ben Thomas</a></p>
<p>Vivek Kamath along with Suresh were my roomates and colleagues for PS-1. We were thrown into ICF chennai by the sad PSD. Thanks to Viveks sources, we found out the accomodation provided by BITS was crappy and we found our own place. Vivek is intelligent and hardworking. But he is also smart enough to see when work is going in vain and when to stop(read:ICF work) and do productive work instead(his other project /\). He gave us good advice about what to do and what not to do in Chennai. He is also great at bargaining with rickshaw drivers :P I’m glad I had some company for eating non-veg there! But for some reason he feels insulted when laughed at... take li8 dude, we need to laugh at ourselves sometimes(after all the stupid things we do)! Wish you all the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/dylan-j-colaço">Dylan J Colaço</a></p>
