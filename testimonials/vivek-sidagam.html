<h1 class="page-title">Vivek Sidagam</h1><p>Awesomest buddy to hangout with. Defines dudism on so many levels, he doesn’t even know yet. Amongst the most adventurous, ambitious and brilliant persons I have ever met. Curiosity drives him and makes him do stuff which some people might think crazy but I am also his partner in crime for I share the same interests. Collects weird things hoping he would find use of them someday, which finally end up in trash(:P). It makes me sad that we won’t be able to execute a lot of mischievous plans we made over the years, but god has his own mischievous plan for you and it will be hell of a ride. Enjoy it and make a mark, all the best for your future bro, keep rocking!! :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shakti-thakran">Shakti Thakran</a></p>
<p>Unpredictable, is the word many would use to define him… A free soul who would wander out of curiosity and excitement, this would puzzle some but frankly speaking is the best thing about him. Fun loving, caring and a master in playing pranks. Pleasing personality that has won him several fans including me myself. Music is the fuel that drives him but his dance moves are a bit too informal, if you know what I mean ( :P). As much he has craving for good quality food, he can serve heaven on a plate with his cooking skills. Can build up a relationship with virtually anything (pets, toys, books, friends....) which he'll surely hold on to, till eternity. Will be wealthy and successful in future for sure.... GOOD WISHES..!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/guest">Guest</a></p>
