title: Vydehi Chinta
---
<h1 class="page-title">Vydehi Chinta</h1><p>I was introduced to Vydehi by Pooja while going for the afternoon session of orientation. Our friendship only became stronger with time. In 1-1 I had a philosophical talk with her on ‘friendship’ and what we expect from our friends :P Surprisingly most of our views matched . I also remember those long chats about our family, past life etc. She is very expressive… I can understand what she is talking in Telugu (most of it) even though I barely know the language. It was nice to see ‘Happy Days’ with her… She would explain every dialogue in detail… We took more than double the movie time to finish it! She spends most of her time talking on phone... ;) She doesn’t get tensed up easily. Sometimes she starts studying exactly a day before exam and yet manages to do pretty well in the paper and scores more than those who have regularly studied :P. Whatever she does, she does it perfectly (will ask doubts till she completely understands the concept). Has her own principles of life.. (which I don’t understand). She loves shopping.. Will go on shopping stuff even if she doesn’t need it and may not even use it . . She is a bit lazy sometimes… Almost never locks her mess option and then uses other’s I-card to come to A-mess :D (that’s when I forget to lock her mess option :P) She used to be homesick in 1st year.. And wanted to be in some local college in AP. She is a good student of mine (learning Marathi) ;) notes down the words and their meanings… ( but that lasts only few days and I have to start from scratch next time she has a mood to learn :D) Am sure she will be successful in whatever she does (there is luck to back up her efforts :P )… stay in touch.. ?<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/priyanka-bari">Priyanka Bari</a></p>
<p>Vydehi :
Bubbly … all time happy … extremely talkative, outgoing, inquisitive .. This is vydehi  one those few without whom life at BITS would be impossible …  Before entering BITS had heard a lot about very few girls being in computer science (which kindf scared me :P)… but as soon as I entered CH5 I met this girl on the first day … n I was extremely excited to hear that she was in CS too. Our bonding began on that very day itself . Be it the registrations … the orientation sessions in the audi … we were together throughout the whole admission process and I had come to know of her quite well then. I remember the first few days of BITS, where we had to make our own time tables … I had no clue about any seniors on campus … but .. (here is where ragging turned helpful :P).. a few seniors who had ragged her helped us out in the time table preparation.  Though we were not very close in the first year but it was second year I got a special friend (thanx to the CS pre cdcs ) .. That was when combined studies began … studying with you always proved beneficial  (was sumthing lyk a lucky charm :P) … be it disco (t1 both scored so well :P) .. thermo … es2 .. it was amazing .. I think 2-2 brought us even more closer.. Anything new in my life .. be it good or bad .. it was her .. whom I could rush to and tell .. ( sorry for bugging you with many silly small problems :P) .. There is hardly anything that she din noe about me … I think we have had some of the awsmest discussions bot random things … bot campus .. bot people …small debates during lunch n dinners … sitting in your room with HP n laughing on random things … all of it was just amazing … In my second year since I hardly knew seniors … she was of great help .. as der were very few in campus whom she did not know :P … . Vydehi is one of the most helpful persons I have met. She values friendship and can go to any extent to help her friends.  Moving on to third year .. the year wid the heavy cdcs … 99% of the times we were together in all classes … (trying to keep each other awake in some boring classes :P) ..the assignment partners  … (we both rock wen we do sumthing 2gther :P) .. It was then I made a friend for life … Vydehi is very down to earth … smart .. witty  .. inquisitive .. and a great friend to have ..  who can come up with very good advices  and make you feel better … ?. Hoping to have a great time in pS2 (please do come to Bangalore  :P .. ). Do stay this close forever .. wishing you all the very best for your future endeavors.

<p>Vydehi!!!! Your name was pretty famous as soon our campus life started...:) I wondered who is this girl and was unaware about you for a couple of days..Then i was introduced to you by lahiri Srinivas...I guess you remember that..I used to get angry because you always kept forgetting my name.. :P   :P. but then our acquaintance  did not last for a long time until 3-1..It was again lahiri in inclusion to S.K.Sri Ram  and through them we became good friends.Of course i was also introduced to H.P :).In this short span of 4 to 5 months i learnt a lot about you..Briefly mentioning..very good at distributing work..getting your work done with right kind of people..good contacts..sharp, jovial, rejuvenating,a good confidence booster,maintains a perfect balance in professional and personal life...will be with people in crisis times etc :) Coming to studies and academics i guess there is hardly anything left to say and i presume it would rather be redundant if i start telling about your attitude towards academics and career.. :). The bike trip is a memorable one in my life....All in All..Vydehi, you are a perfect blend of intelligence,beauty and soft heartedness. I speculate i cannot write anything more than this but yeah i would definitely say that our friendhip has a long way to go... All the very best for your future endeavors!!!...Good luck Chinta!!!! keep smiling  :)  :)   :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/maltumkar-deepak-raj">Maltumkar Deepak Raj</a></p>
<p>Chinta! Sharp,intelligent,smart and stylish!... She is a girl who can continue day-dreaming for hours and is also very talkative :D. I remember your countless number of never-ending phone calls back in first year. She is very friendly and can talk to any person without hesitation, trustworthy, fun-loving , gets rarely tensed, manages to do well in acads whether she studies beforehand or not.. One can never get bored in her company! If you have a head-ache or if you are tensed or anything similar to that, all you have to do is go to her room :P. She can keep on talking, showing what she explored in the recent past that you completely forget about it!.  Seriously!... You are a wonderful person and be the same.

<p>One really cool and fun person this girl is :)
Came to know her quite late (in second year i guess) and the first time i remember seeing her was probably some festival (mayb ganesh festival or ugadi) when she was wearing something traditional and i remember thinking that she was really pretty that time. Not just pretty, she is smart too :P and funny!
Always ready to laugh :P
All those mess lunches wouldnt have been as much fun if it wasn't for her.
Oh and she can talk A LOT :P
Can suddenly switch from serious to funny modes and vice versa easily. Extremely carefree person and yet can get damn serious when she is needed to be like for academics.
Will do absolutely anything for her friends! :) And ALL her friends ( and i must say she has many many friends) ...there are times i cant handle being there for all my friends all the time even with the limited number of friends i have and this girl just surprises me by doing that with almost twice the number of friends i have! She is truly amazing and a really gr8 friend to have! 
Always there when you need her whether you want to talk about something or ask any doubt or plan anything or even just go to the mess at the last minute :P
And the way she teases me is also fun :P
Have got to know her a lot this past year and i am glad we are going for ps2 in the same semester ...coz i get one more sem to enjoy with her! :)
Dont EVER change Vydehi and keep being the awesome person you are! 
Looking forward to our trip! :) We are going to have so much fun! :)
