<h1 class="page-title">Yachit Mahajan</h1><p>Yachit Mahajan aka Kasab is the guy you ping for knowing about new tech stuff. I discovered many new softwares through him. Thanks for that mate. I would always remember those moments when I, Subhanshu, Yash and he played 4 Player Reactor infinite times on his Android, the Vagator trip when he fell sick and we all got worried. He is very cool-minded, humble and never fails to amaze you with his ‘technically-correct’ information (:P). Wish you all the best for your future endeavours :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>The World has Wikipedia, we have Kasab 8-) I still don't know why he doesn't like this nick, but remember, we won't ever stop calling you that ;) This Kasab thing came in from a pic of his which looked like Ajmal Kasab and since then we had an internal brotherhood of Pakistani origin between you and <a href="http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/683" target="_blank">Sahil</a>. I have never seen someone more technical equipped than him. Those minute details of anything and everything. Google Maps mein you can exchange directions by dragging those Alphabet balloons, yeh kisko pata hota hai? And then he will have a logic behind it saying "maine kabhi ..blah blah blah.. kiya tha usse ..blah blah blah.. hua and usse I came to know this" He's a genuinely nice guy, always helpful, has a bit of that Dirac-Delta anger-cum-frustration withing him and a very good friend whom you can always look upto! Do keep in Touch :) Best,<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yash-patodia">Yash Patodia</a></p>
<p>Kasab aka Yachit aka TDK : P , is the GOD of our wing. Ne problem, he has a solution ,be it technical  related to mobile, lappy, software, hardware( O.o ), internet, proxy , tablets,blah blah… (TDK >.<) or be it making rose out of paper, design with handkerchief .. . To state the truth he know almost something about everything and on being asked how does he know it ( pataa nahi bande ko kya kya pataa hai ), he will reply “ Abe, pehle kabhi toh kiya tha..” Best part – u speak something wrong in front of him, he will correct you at that time itself and all of us will bow to him _/\__/\_ hailing TDK!!!! And then he will laugh . Not a big fan of mongi/NC or other hangout places  he is (or rather was :P) an ideal college student who will sleep early (0030 we r talking abt ) and attend all “morning” classes. I remember doing DC chudaap with him in our 2nd year and those phuugaa smileys B-) . Gets irritated very easily. Coming to acads , extremely serious about his acads and during test/compre exam his fav dialogue “ Yaar, soo gaya tha jaldi, kuch nahi hua  : ( ” . will send u weird links, trailers , pics, songs (good ones and also pritam ke churaye hue ) via gtlak (P.S our conversation always starts with “wazza nigga/bitch”!!!!). FB during holidays \m/\m/\m/\m/ .Its always fun talking to him and he is always there to help. 
Really glad to have met u and have u as one my close frnd.May your future be \m/\m/. All the best and stay in touch!!!!  :)

<p> When I knock on his door and ask "Kasab kya kar raha hai??" he replies "Kuch nahi, Time pass" but then there is the surprise random fact! "Your finger nails grow 4 times faster than your toe nails!!" or any other!You will always learn something when you are around this guy! some minute, specific details of any random thing under the sun! Yachit will know it!! Probably the thing i will miss the most about him!My neighbour, infamously known as Chemical Detective Kasab(CDK) is the man to go for troubleshooting, be it computers, electronic stuff... i told this before n is still right! "Tujhe CS mein rehna tha, baaki sab lite ho jate!!" That afternoon when spontaneously decided to go to bombay :) we were out in 3 hrs! All that knowledge and is still a very caring, humble person.He literally made me attend classes till 2nd year, woke me up every morning. Checked on me for lunch..Not to forget, very very organised!! Room is always in order.Always felt like living in his room! nicely made bed, I'd fall asleep instantly on it!For heavens sake, even on his laptop, all the music, videos and files are in place! even the correct album artist for all the songs! Hats off to your patience and dedication! Compre specialist!!!! not a single compre till now in which he has not phodofied!!
I should probably be thank you for all the help you have been all these years!I have learnt a lot of great and amazing stuff from you and will never forget them!You are definitely heading towards great success..all the best for all your endeavours! keep smiling and do not bomb india! please! :P :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/suresh-m-kashikar">Suresh M Kashikar</a></p>
<p><center>Everyone loves Kasaaa!!</center> <br>Yachit Mahajan!! Everyone loves the bengali babu (though he says that he is not bengali, believe me its a conspiracy, he indeed is bengali.. F**k kya paka raha hoon bey)And why not..With that simple nature of his.. As I always say, all the beautiful things in the world are simple and the converse. No one personifies as much as the way you do.  It might seem redundant after all this time, since I use this statement too loosely, but that is untrue, I mean it my friend. So when i say that I love you for your simple nature and heart, I mean it. When i say i love you for your urge/fetish :p for pin point accuracy for every detail to perfection in every argument, I mean it. (Mind you he never loses the soul of the matter by looking at just the details)  When i say that I love you for your Dirac delta anger functions, I mean it. We have shared countless corridor-arguments on who is the hottest chick(well that was not a debate actually) to why a magnetic compass will fail at the poles(okay that was lame). I will always remember those moments. He is one of the guys our parents used to point and say "Yachit bhaiya jaise sharif aur sincere ban na hain tumhe"  You have struck quite a many chords in my heart with that natural smile and child like innocence. I do know that we have been great buddies all the time, but i so wish we had spent more time. I so wish we had seen more of each other. It was always great to have you around. I love you Kasaaa and i will miss you. PS: Have you listened to the song "Suno-na Suno-na"?? :p :D <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
