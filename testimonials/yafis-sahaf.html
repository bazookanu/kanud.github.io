<p>If Jimmy Wales would have been knowing this person, he would have definitely added "Yafis" as a synonym of sarcasm & irony on a Wiki page. And trying to win an argument against him is just an unachievable attempt (okay, unless your name is 'Bunty' :P). No one can ever fool him on any issue (& yeah! this time, even if your name is 'Bunty' :P). On the other part, a very knowledgeable person! He is very hard working as well. Ultimate fun to hang out with. He just brings that laugh on everyone's face (sorry (evryone-1)'s face, ek bande ki to le raha hota hai :P) in the group, somehow. But he never means or tries to hurt anyone. Thinks thrice before saying anything. Very good at heart. With his hard work & so much witty mind, he'll definitely reach great heights in future. Wish u all the best Yafis :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivam-rajpal">Shivam Rajpal</a></p>
<p>Saucy , intelligent  fun to hang out with,Yafis is a guy who possess razor sharp intelligence.
He is my AOM Guru,mentor and motivator. RESONANCE will be the perfect word to describe our friendship. ( Goddamn!! how can u  predict my thoughts ???). A philosopher in himself, chasten his thoughts like hell. he is an epitome of energy, positive attitude and is a bank of advisory. A scrupulous person who is very optimistic about life can cheer u in seconds.
when it comes to dry humor and sarcasm , Yafis is the name which pops out in everyone's mind.(Ask anyone). he is a great listener and conversationalist.A true narrator possessing careen words can interpret incidents with a sensational presence of mind. OMG how can u do this all the time??.  he always thinks N times before  oozing words , weighing pros and cons of each word (N --> determined by the caliber of the victim listener).
his Analytic prowess is supplemented by his tremendous knowledge in almost every sphere of life. he is a fitness freak. In acads, he can almost top a subject without trying really hard.
he is one of the most amazing and interesting personality, one can ever come across.
his sincerity,intelligence and dedication will surely  fetch him laurels in his life

<p>Kashmir se aaya hua pardesi.. Yafis is probably the only representation from kashmir than we have in our campus. Though the lad has spent quite a bit of time in delhi and in goa after that , the kashmiri ada is still there. He is of my close friends in bits. Now i must tell you Yafis is very very analytic in nature. He always weighs his words before speaking. It is almost impossible to win in an argument with him. He has immense knowledge about varying fields in life and he uses it to good effect to. Sarcasm is his middle name :P. Hardly does he speak a few lines without garnishing it with his state of the art sarcastic comments :P. He's a really good friend, very dependable always has your back when you are in trouble. He is really good chess player( though he does not play that often now). He is fanatic about boxing and idolizes Muhammad Ali. I have had some great time with you. Never could win in a verbal duel with you, would like to do so in a boxing one some day when we meet again...<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shishir-salvatore">Shishir Salvatore</a></p>
<p>We got to know each other through the EG assignments and since then, he has been of the closest friends I have here. Loves to tell stories (and has great skills to tell them), especially with his characteristic stammering laugh (:P). I have lost count on the number of intellectual regionalist discussions he has on the mess table. He is one of those persons with whom you an have conversations, even the deep ones. We have spent quite a time studying together, timepassing together and sharing a common pain and of course, the trips we had, they were all awesome (especially that palolem one). Good old times :)
Battling through various unfortunate circumstances, he is the epitome of determination and hardwork. Apart from not making the table tremble from the amount of pressure he 
puts onto it while writing, you'll find him either boxing, AOE-ing or watching something. Immensally knowledgable, a good advisor, chess player, friendly, fun, cheerful, charming, grounded in realities, knows sarcasm ( but stretches it a bit too far sometimes ) and a good friend. You are complete package dOOd :D
Though we havn't been able to interact much lately due to our rooms being apart and not having common classes these days, we'll definitely do something together next sem, 
or this sem for that matter.
Be as you are and I hope you go and do what you want :) All the Best.

<p>One of my first friends of the campus, this guy from Kashmir throws bullets at you that you simply cannot dodge. His continuous rattling on any subject,be it politics or sports,acads or any random shit,might seem irritating to some and has also resulted in quite a few popular tantrums, but when u get to see the funny side, all you can do is sit and laugh continuously. Albeit a few isolated times, he has been my constant friend throughout my Bits life and my mess companion, even during the exams :P Quite a good boxer and jogger, a born comic actor and add to this good acads, he has a bright future ahead. Stay this way and torment a lot more people :P All the best :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/thiyagarajan-b">THIYAGARAJAN B</a></p>
<p>The first person I met on campus; and interestingly enough we were also classmates at VMC, sat besides each other for WHOLE TWO years & never even knew each others name. I have the fondest of memories from my 1-1 - the hours and hours we spent discussing random & unbelievably hypothetical situations with Tyagi, Bunty, Balaaji and Sumit.  It is still sometimes difficult to believe his innate human-ness. His degree and sense of comic acting is immaculate. It was him because of whom my College life was bearable.

I remember 1 incident when Sumit hadnt spoken to both of us during T2 (while he used to study with Harshit), and then returning to us after T2 one day with a packet of biscuits. Without even heeding any attention, Yafis' first remark on those biscuits were- "Sumit, ye biscuits Britannia ke hain ya "Guilt" ke?!? "

It was not until Bunty joined the cult, where the whole phenomenon of AOM started. 
Studies were always his forte - VMS being the prime example - the lengths of discussions we had about Vivek Bhaiya & Bade bhaiya was the epitome; and dude, I still cant believe you scored a 74 on 75 in Physics! Man, that was my total in the subject!
AND Man, did he suck at playing TT. Balaaji's finesse in the sport & Bunty's signature shots took the better of him everytime; and of course then, there was me! :P
But it was Chess where he showed his true genius. He is the awesomest chess player I have ever witnessed, proof being the really really long chess matches between Balaaji & him. 

Man, it has been a real honour to have known you. I wish you the best for your future & I hope you fulfill all your dreams in your life - because you deserve them!

PS: I know it is not the most boldest or valiant of ways to say - but am truly sorry for the ways I have upset you.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shivansh-srivastava">Shivansh Srivastava</a></p>
