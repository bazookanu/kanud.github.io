<h1 class="page-title">Yash Patodia</h1><p>Yash Patodia aka Pato aka Therthee Thrwee :P ……. I remember meeting you first in CC while you and <a href = "http://10.10.10.115/melange/user/profile/683"> Sahil </a> were practising EG. And then once in my room you were explaining us some variable mass concept. I was like how intelligent he is. Hell yea !!! I never met anyone before who was as razor sharp, smart, logical and as quick as Yash. He has this zeal for solving a problem however difficult it may be. He finds logic in everything (even Opti :P). He patiently answered me whenever I bugged him about the cube. He is very helpful, cool-minded, a very fast learner and has this never say die attitude. I seriously felt bad when I barked on you that day. Sorry for that mate :) And don’t worry I will let both of you know at the right time :P Wish you all the best for your future and do keep in touch :)

P.S. – Gita mein C kaun laata hai be !!!!!! :P :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/vishal-sinha">Vishal Sinha</a></p>
<p>"Good things come in small packages" :p. Yash is one of my very first and dearest friends in the campus. Now there is a notion that bongs are generally geeks and I would just like to add that I know it to be true. :p God has been rather kind in giving him the grey matter and his cold logical attitude under all circumstances is truly remarkable. Our last minute assignment submissions, our ever-lasting discussions ranging from politics, engg to movies and our night outs have been some delightful memories. The guy is a true friend and a helpful neighbor. Always stay in touch and atb for your future endeavours & love interests :P. You will do well at whatever you do. <br>- <a href = "/testimonials/sahil-gupta">Sahil Gupta</a></p>

<p>Yash Patodia, true genius. Your desire to learn has always been more than ever! Right from those IIT-coaching days when you came to know about Peter Answers' secret (I got you there! :P) and you began making your own version(seriously? and you kept improving it /\ ); to E-Dorado; to 1st year summer break when you mastered web designing; till today, there is always something up with you. <br>
And believe me, everything I know is because of some incident or the other. It is like the Slumdog Millionaire, you see :P <br>
You don't really need my best wishes, I know you will phodufy anyhow, wherever you go. Anyways, all the best for your future. Keep in touch. <br>
PS: Stop stalking people :P, especially the one in the beginning of this sentence. ;)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/yachit-mahajan">Yachit Mahajan</a></p>

<p>Yash Patodia a.k.a. pato a.k.a. thutty thrwee.I just cannot understand his affinity for the number "3". So many things in his life is associated with 3. For instance, the sum of digits of the his id no (i.e. 2+4+6) and  his pin code no =3!!.He also loves watching  thrwee-D movies ;). OK,Jokes apart,pato is a true Genius.He has  has a very sharp mind and a tremendous ability to grasp things very quickly.Loves solving puzzles and brain teasers, especially the tougher ones.Pato is a very focussed person and knows what exactly he wants.I can bet that he'll definitely phodufy CAT. A good neighbour and a true friend.He's always ready to help his friends.Pro at academics(Sabke EG,CP,MOS etc  k doubts isi ne clear kiye hain apne wing mein).Pato's score in any test -20 = av. This is how we predict the averages after the exams :D.Bas bhagwad gita mein C laya hai :P.He is a hopeless romantic(1st yr se ab tak kuch nahi kiya!).There are a few things about him that I dont like.1st-He never watches a movie before reading its plot from the internet.And 2nd he plays his favourite song for one whole week(paka deta hai :@).And I almost forgot to mention this thing! Guys(and not gals :P) ,be happy whenever he bets against you ;)  There is 333.33% chance that u'll win :D (ask cheku and redo).Will definitely miss you my friend..,best of luck for the future.And keep in touch :)

PS:His favourite movie is " PS,I love you".<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/arpit-gupta">Arpit Gupta</a></p>
<p>There are two ways to live your life: 1) To give a damn. 2) To not to give a damn.  You are one of the most confident and courageous guy i have ever know. These adjectives are not randomly chosen thesaurus words, you know that, I mean them. You might find him to be a heartless bastard, but i have come to know through all these years how true a friend you are. Stands up to what he believes. Loves what he does. All this time i have never seen him regret about anything, this is a mark of a happy man. However, at times i find that you lose the bigger picture by analyzing "every" phenomena. An honest guy he always has been and truly rejoices at others' achievements. And this is one of the most important thing that i have learnt from you. Thanks for all. And of course after all this time, I have a truly marvelous account of how wonderful his brain and his ideas are but this damn space is too narrow to contain. ;-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/milind-shyani">Milind Shyani</a></p>
<p>Patodia!!!!! Apne wing ka phodu. _/\_ he is. True genius, damn intelligent, sharp and very quick.  Loves raiding (fetish for baba’s room ) , loves stalking >.< , witty ,gets excited about nething very quickly. me and Suresh used to ( and still ) think and talk  ki “yeh yahan kya kar raha hai “. Whenever I used to ask him doubt (regarding studies obb  :P), 7/10 times I didn’t get it 1st time. He is so fast in explaining things. Love hanging out @ his room. Takes li8 courses ultra li8 ( workshop, GEETA _/\_ _/\_ :respect: ) . doesn’t attend classes still phodufies courses. It was his idea and he is the founder of \m/ (waise idea toh kuch aur hi tha , if u remember correctly “add random ppl (not exactly ;) )  and start conversation “). If he gets his head into something then usee chhodata hi nahi. Unlucky with girls (Abe yaaarrrr!!!!)  ;) :P .  Had some awesome trips with him( 1st self-drive ride  :D , 35 ppl 1 bus lolaaa!! ,utorda !), awesome hang outs  mongi , nc , his room ,suri’s room, yachits’ room , corridor . U Certainly have a very bright future and will definitely  go a long way!!!! Nice to have u as my friend ,All the best, keep in touch ….<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/shubham-rao">Shubham Rao</a></p>
