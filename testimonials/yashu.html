<h1 class="page-title">Yashu</h1><p>Yashu Rakesh Agarwal is the most random chick i have ever known!!..:P....You walk with her and she gets lost mid-way, you talk to her and she phases out!! :D...All this being said, she is the person you should always maintain safe distance from( she loves pulling people's hair :P)..hehehe...She is one hell of a person who would always go an extra mile for a friend!! When she cares, she cares too much and that makes her so adorable!!...And last and surely not the least, she is a rumor machine!!... Her randomness is epic!!..:D..You sit with her for 10 minutes and you will go crazy laughing!!...Madam try not to forget us ( yeah she tends to do that :P)!!..Have a rocking life ahead!!...And try being a little less random!!..:D..Cheers!!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/kirti-dahiya">Kirti Dahiya</a></p>
<p>This girl is all about randomness.....!! :P

She knows every random guy/girl on campus, including the guy you will see for the 1st time on campus. She gets lost easily.She has a very caring nature and a wonderful friend. All you do is laugh when you are with her.  She obeys rules very strictly, eg. side leg stand of activa is just for you to keep your leg on it n sit properly, after that you are nt suppose to keep your leg on it, and she won't. Instead she will prefer to keep her legs hanging in air. :P:D

She will come all the way from ch5 to study in lib with all her books n laptop, will study for 10min, den will keep her head down foh nxt 15min, and after that she will go back to hostel to sleep for 2 more hours. And after 2 hours you will get a call to collect her belongings n keep them with you.

All I wonder is if she is like this, how will her kids be!! Hope to see them one day :P

<p>yashu rakesh agarwal/aag/god(in her own words) is to say the very least a very random chick. She knows everyone, practically everyone!! Walking with her makes you feel like there like she is some sort of celebrity. Everybody knows her .She will stop and talk to every next person :P Other than that she is one of the most energetic chicks. She is bubbling and singing in the dead of the night when everyone else is just too sleepy. She is one of the foremost promoters of f.r.i.e.n.d.s ! She is like a kid who can laugh without a joke and loves pulling hair ( some people are extremely scared of standing next to her!), She can make your mood all better just by coming in your room and making some extremely random comment  :) She is also one of the best friends you can have and is just the perfect amount of cute!! :D<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/mili-mishra">Mili Mishra</a></p>
<p>Yashu-well the name means god.She is obviously not god and definitely not human.She is one hell of a crazy person.She actually makes me feel normal about myself.Always on a high (Thou wen actually on a high she gets all senti). Always one step ahead of everyone-When people are serious she is smiling and when people are smiling she is laughing.She is one of those friends you can't afford to lose.Extremely sweet, caring and random is how I will define her.A big fan of attending marriages(god knows why);she might do friendship with you just so that you will get her into a good marriage :P.One of my closest friends,fellow food gang member (would have starved without you) and most importantly my "bad girl". Sweetheart we are friends for life.Ek main hu aur ek tu...I wanna be with you (yes its our song) :P<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/basanti">BASANTI</a></p>

<p>First impression, kitna bolti hain yaar! Its been great knowing Yashu in the brief time we've interacted. Her existence as an economics student makes her leg so pullable but a pretty passionate student she is. Enjoyed the conversations and argument(s) we've had ranging from Eco vs Mech to Green Buildings to teachers and grading and all the bleh in the world. Hope you have some great years ahead and keep the pleasant demeanor forever.<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/advait-tinaikar">Advait Tinaikar</a></p>
<p>U have always been so much fun to hang out. with all your jokes, although most on me, are something i will always remember. Someone who has her own opinion about things and strength to stand by it is something I really admire in u. Wish u luck for ur life...keep Rocking \m/ :)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/krati-agrawal">Krati Agrawal</a></p>
<p>Yashu is one of the  most interesting people of our economics class. She's intelligent and what I really admire about her is that she tries to develop a deep insight into things rather than just mugging up. The views that she comes up with during the classroom discussions are always very different and remarkably thoughtful. The best thing about Yashu is that she's totally chilled out. It's always fun talking to her. She's extremely courteous and very helpful. She's a great dancer and also very sincere when it work. A true all-rounder! I remember working with her in Zephyr. At times she handled the most difficult situations single-handedly when the others had no idea what to do. With this spirit and your amazing attitude, I'm sure you'll achieve great success :) All the best!<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/gaurav-manoj-jha">Gaurav Manoj Jha</a></p>

<p>Yashu! I  remember her telling me in 1-1 how she responded to the id no. 333 when it was her room no :P
She has been next  to me in most labs - be it EG, CP-II, MT-2 and MuP.
We always have a blast! MuP design assignment was epic! Till 3 am on the table tennis table, munching raisins along. She is an amazing dancer and one of the most helpful people i know. Stay the same Yashu and never change! Wish you loads of luck!

<p>Yashu! i remember having met you first during big break! after we were inducted to dance club i got to interact more with you and i realised that we were in the same boat when it comes to views regarding dance, the dance ideas and dance club as a whole and also how both of us are fond of tara :P. You definitely are a very social person,  always try to make sense out of whatever you study and not just  mug up things for the heck of it... You have a say in all discussions. And i really cant miss out  mentioning how good you are at any couple dance i still need to learn that from you.... also yes i do listen to more songs now :P All the best for future :-)<br>- <a href = "/testimonials/richa-dwivedi">Richa Dwivedi</a></p>

<p>Yashu yashu.... yaar she is just this awesome person who will be happy all the time... People call her 'random' , well there is one thing constant about her... the way she greets you , no matter how sad you are she will instantly cheer you up. Im gonna miss the way you shout adiiiii ...
She just makes you wonder that this kid is really ahead of everyone in life .. she cares less for saddening things , is always agog and loves a her friends with all her soul. Of course she gets irascibly angry just like a child really but then you end up laughing together in the flick of a moment.

Have fun in life and do not give up the way you are.... hope to see you soon
