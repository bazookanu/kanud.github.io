<h1 class="page-title">YEMBULURU VAMSI KRISHNA</h1><p>Met him for the first time in my first journey towards my second home.. my first impression on him"studious".(its true anyways :P).cool guy,never goes into any sort of trouble by himself.though he gets into one,he is efficient enough to get out of it.hardworking and dedicated towards acads. Active member of DoSaR(formerly DoS) and book bank. I wouldn't have got my cdc books without him(most of them of course). He watches almost every t show released on dc. Now a days, i see him taking part in things other than studies which indicates the TRANSFORMATION :P. I wish all the best and great success for his bright future coming ahead and certainly, i will miss u.. wish we'll keep in touch..
